#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Since the Croke Park agreement was signed everyone has been aware there was going to be a very significant reduction in the number of people working in the public sector.  The key part of the agreement and the commitments made by the Taoiseach, as leader of a party, and the TÃ¡naiste were that front line public services would be maintained irrespective of the numbers that would be reduced.  We know 29 February is the closing date for applications for the early retirement scheme and February was always going to be the month when the majority of staff were going to leave.While that, in itself, is not a surprise, the lack of a detailed plan on how to deal with this exodus is now a major and astounding reality.  According to the latest figures, approximately 8,000 public service workers are expected to leave, with health and education making up the bulk of those retirements in addition to hundreds in the Garda and the Defence Forces.  We know arrangements were being made in the education sector, with teachers being retained on lower pay scales.  We know consultant-led services will be lost in the health arena, including consultants in the area of midwifery.  Specialist nurses, public health nurses and staff nurses are retiring, and they will not be retained even where replacements are not available in essential fields of activity.We know from Professor Michael Turner, the director of the HSE's obstetrics and gynaecology programme, that staff reductions will see an increase in Ireland's maternal and infant mortality rates.  To that must be added the comments of consultant obstetrician Dr. Gerry Burke in Limerick, who made even starker statements that people, including women, will pay with their lives.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	A question, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We knew this was coming for quite a long time.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House a detailed plan to show what areas, specifically in the regard to health, will lose posts and how front line services will be protected in those areas, arising out of contingency planning by the Government?  Will he outline the details of that plan to the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform this morning gave a very clear outline of the position we are moving into.  There are 300,000 persons employed in the public sector; 3% of these are leaving and 97% will remain in situ.  Clearly, the flexibility that is inherent in the Croke Park agreement will now be put to the test.  The Government has no intention of allowing a situation where it is not possible for front line services to be fulfilled.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It has already started.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	From that point of view, there is a central planning unit in the Department of Public and Expenditure and Reform, there are local sectoral planning units and each Department is monitoring the situation in so far as they are all concerned.  For example, the Minister for Health has asked the HSE to draw up a risk assessment in regard to the staffing situation, which will identify particular pressure points that arise across the health sector.It should be borne in mind that this is a decision people make for themselves in respect of their own lives and futures.  Some are making this choice to leave earlier than might normally be expected, others because they are close to the normal retirement age and others because they want to get out for a variety of reasons.  It is a decision being made by the significant number of people whom we now know have given their notice of intention to retire at the end of February.The Minister for Health also intends to review the service plan once he has absolute clarity on the full impact of what is going to happen in the health service at the end of the 29 February grace period, as that is called.  It is important to note that in the area of health, to which Deputy Martin referred, the Minister is accelerating the health reform agenda and building in new innovative and efficient models of care, for example, the clinical care programmes.  The HSE national service plan includes a commitment within the context of the Croke Park agreement to address greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, particularly for nursing and medical staff in front line services.Deputy Martin made reference to Dr. Burke from Limerick.  As a senior medical person, he, with many others, has a duty and a responsibility to keep the levels of service to the highest standard possible.The situation in so far as flexibility is concerned will assist in staffing and budget reductions.  The HSE plan recognises that certain positions may need to be filled, although this is, of course, subject to the overall pay and numbers for 2012.  I point out that exempt grades for 2011 included consultant doctors, psychiatric nurses, emergency medical technicians and public health nurses.  That review is constantly being monitored by the central unit in the Department of Public and Expenditure and Reform, in each individual line Department and by each Minister.  Local managers are looking at the potential impact of the numbers in the local areas and this is being monitored by the sectoral groups within the central Department of Public and Expenditure and Reform.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Taoiseach used the words "monitor", "review" and "the Minister has asked".

This is a matter of life and death.  I am not saying that, Dr. Burke is saying it and the Taoiseach quoted Dr. Burke.

The Taoiseachâs line has been that if a referendum is necessary it will be held.  He has told us repeatedly he has nothing to fear from a referendum.  I put it to the Taoiseach that here we are looking at another example of his having one message for the domestic audience while he says something different at a European level.  We saw this carry on in Davos and we see it again.The Taoiseach tried to spoof the people by referring this treaty to the Attorney General.  In reality what he has tried to create is a pre-cooked deal.

If that report were true here is a case where 25 countries agree, according to the words of that official, there should not be a referendum in Ireland in any circumstances?  We would have, therefore, enormous influence in Europe, in spite of what the Deputyâs leader stated yesterday.

I want the Taoiseach to confirm or deny to the House that this was the case.The Taoiseach mentioned Ireland's influence.  The truth is the only stages where Ireland has exerted that influence is when the people had the opportunity to vote at referendum.  I believe the Irish electorate is extremely influential.

Will the Taoiseach tell us whether in the course of that intensive engagement officials acting on behalf of this State worked with others to craft a treaty that would frustrate a referendum?I wish to put another question to the Taoiseach-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Thank you.  The Deputy is over time.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am sorry, Deputy, you are over time.  Thank you.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	-----the 0.5% target a further â¬6 billion in cuts will be involved.  Is that also the Taoiseach's estimate?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	86	That is a separate question.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Given the level of that austerity how can the Taoiseach imagine-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	88	You are over time, Deputy.  Please resume your seat.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	89	-----it would be acceptable to collude with others to frustrate the democratic process in this jurisdiction?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I am surprised the Deputy ignores the Chair.  She is over time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Deputy McDonald confuses structural debt with the deficit in this country.  I assure her the officials from this country who worked intensively over the period since Christmas with officials from other countries were not given a mandate to frustrate anybody's democratic rights but a mandate to maximise Ireland's interests.  In the discussions that took place, the officials constantly referred to the position in so far as Ireland and its national interests were concerned, as did other countries.When Deputy McDonald speaks of austerity programmes, she must understand this intergovernmental agreement and treaty is about getting political agreement for fiscal discipline, proper budgetary management and the running of the affairs of each country and its public finances in a proper fashion.  It is about stimulating the Single Market and making available the potential for jobs and growth in a European Union of more than 500 million people, which is central to the agenda.  Deputy McDonald should also bear in mind that central to the issue debated by the Irish officials and myself is that it is clear that nothing in this treaty affects the fact Ireland is in a programme until the end of 2013.  This supersedes all of the discussions in so far as the intergovernmental treaty is concerned.  This was endorsed again by the conclusions of Monday's meeting where the Heads of Government specifically referred to the fact that a country leaving a programme will continue to receive funding so long as it measures up to the conditions for which it signed on.  That is the story.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Is the story in today's press right or wrong?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	93	As far as our officials were concerned, their mandate was to maximise and protect Ireland's interests in these discussions.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	94	And prevent a referendum.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Nothing in this treaty impacts on the fact that we are in a programme until the end of 2013.  In the event that a country like Ireland were to require further external funding, it will be made available to it, as signed off on by the Heads of Government on Monday.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Thank you, Taoiseach.  I call Deputy Ross.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I wish the Taoiseach would use the threat of a referendum more often when he goes to Europe.  It is a powerful threat and obviously has an effect.  We should have used it at the time of the IMF-EU deal which would have secured us better terms.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	98	It was not this Government that signed up to that deal.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	99	It is something the European leaders fear.  The deal in Brussels on Monday was undoubtedly a lap of honour for Angela Merkel and Germany as the most powerful economic country in Europe.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Hear, hear.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	101	That must be acknowledged.  Citigroup described the deal as a compact for low growth.  That leaves a great deal of unfinished business for Ireland and particularly for this Government.There are two elements to my question.  The first is the debt which the Taoiseach will say he will come to at the next summit.  The second is unemployment, an issue which is not of great interest to Germany.  Yesterday, it was announced unemployment in Germany had gone down from 6.8% to 6.7% while, at the same time as the Taoiseach came back with this deal, EUROSTAT announced unemployment in Europe is at its highest level since the euro was introduced in 1998.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	102	A question, please.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I know the Taoiseach spoke with passion and interest about unemployment and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, after the meeting in which the compact was agreed.As a result of this compact for low growth, what prospect has Ireland got of lowering its unemployment rate?  Has the Taoiseach delivered a single extra job from this summit?  As a result of this compact, are there any prospects for a single extra job in Europe or will we have a higher unemployment rate?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I always thought Deputy Ross was in favour of balanced budgets.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	He is not anymore.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I have referred before to the respect he is held in as a foremost economist.  I would like to hear him comment now on whether, as an economist, he supports balanced budgets.The Council meeting was divided into two sections.  The first part was about the jobs agenda, youth unemployment, SMEs and the potential of the Single Market.  There were contributions from most member states around the table on these central issues.  I am not sure whether Deputy Ross was here yesterday but I want him to understand this will be a central feature of every agenda for every Council meeting from now on.  European politics should be about the growth of economies and the creation of jobs and job opportunities.In respect of Ireland having a higher than average rate of unemployment of young people, it is one of the countries that is required to have an action plan put in place by the end of April to focus on this matter.  That is why the Government has already done serious work through the programme for action on job and business opportunities led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the activation changes that will be introduced by the Minister for Social Protection in providing opportunities for people to move off the live register through retraining, upskilling or a change in career direction.  Yesterday, 800 new jobs were announced, as the Deputy knows.It is obvious that we have had a continuing crisis for two and a half years.  One point brought to light at Monday's meeting was that serious moneys in EU funds, billions in many cases, were allocated to member states but were not drawn down.  Individual member states did not put forward projects that could have met demand for infrastructure construction and created thousands of jobs.  Ireland, I am glad to say, is one of the few countries that has almost exhausted its allocation of Structural Funds.  By and large, good use was made of these in providing infrastructure.There are 23 million SMEs across the European Union; coincidentally, there are 23 million people unemployed.  In theory, if one could relate one to the other, one would solve the problem.  Theories, however, do not always work in reality.  Jobs, growth and employment opportunities are central to the European Council's agenda from now on.  In June, there will be a report on best practice for SMEs across the Union.  Issues such as the competitiveness league and the increased opportunities provided when a country raises it competitiveness have been raised.  Ireland, I am glad to say, has made significant improvements in this respect in the recent past.Job prospects are challenging.  However, the political agreement now arrived at will allow the Union to review the extent of the firewall in March.  As Ms Christine Lagarde said, if the firewall is big enough, people will not want to climb it in the first place.Matters have moved on.  There has been intensive work with Greece which expects to have its PSI, private sector involvement, matter sorted out in the next fortnight.  There is no longer talk about the destruction of the euro or catastrophic defaults all over the place.  The politics of the Council have focused on the conclusion of the text agreed.In the beginning, the German Chancellor, Ms Merkel, wanted a full European treaty.  That is not possible because of the withdrawal of Britain and now, because, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic will not sign one because of constitutional problems there.  Of the 27 member states, 25 have signed up.  This is a significant advance which allows political leaders to focus on the jobs and growth agenda in their individual countries.  We will do that here through the jobs action plan and activation measures, as well as a whole range of measures that will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I do not doubt for one moment the Taoiseach's or his Ministers' sincerity in wanting to create jobs.  The reality is that it is difficult for an austerity package and a stimulus package to live together.  It is unlikely there will be a stimulus package from Europe while this compact exists.  He spoke about activation clauses and activation plans.  Can he provide us with a forecast figure - as he did in respect of growth last week - for the unemployment rate in this country over the coming two to three years, or does he agree with the forecasts by the Department of Finance?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Even Deputy Ross in all his wisdom cannot indicate what that might be.  It is down from 14.3% to 14.2% according to the latest figures.  I want him to understand that the â¬17 billion capital programme which is laid out for the duration of this Government's lifetime is but part of the measures we are considering.  We have been speaking with the European Investment Bank in regard to its potential and have held discussions with the social partners about the possibility of going after pension funds for investments.In regard to other outside investors who are interested in doing business in Ireland, the interest in respect of the reputation of this country has certainly changed in the past six to eight months and decisions announced by a number of multinationals speak for themselves.  At a time of great economic confusion, the fact that they are prepared to put their money where their mouths are based on the quality and the productivity of the Irish workforce, achieving the objectives they set for themselves and the increased competitiveness in the Irish economy clearly signals strong intent and confidence.The smaller signs, such as the debt swap and the drop in yields from 14% to 6% or 7%, are important.  They do not mean we have arrived where we want to be but they are significant signs of confidence.  While there is a long way to go, the leaders of the Council can now begin to focus on the growth agenda and job provision.  I made this point at the meeting.  For example, if a firm in Ireland wants to patent a product on which it has carried out research, it costs approximately â¬32,000 to have that patent endorsed.  That should not be the case.  In the United States it costs â¬1,500 or â¬1,800.  We want to move to a position where our young entrepreneurs and companies can avail of the opportunities and potential of the Single Market.  For too long, Europe has been bogged down in inter-institutional wrangling, to the detriment of concentrating on what we should be doing, namely, making political decisions that would allow the economies of each of the individual members of the eurozone and the European Union to flourish.  That is in our interest as an exporting nation and that is where our focus will be during our contributions at every Council meeting.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	113	That is fine.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I ask the Taoiseach if he will stay to take questions following the statements.  This would be appropriate given that he headed the negotiations on the matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Not on this occasion because I have a number of other engagements.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs will be present.  I will have plenty of opportunities over the course of the next several weeks to answer directly any questions Deputies may have.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I have no doubt there will be ongoing debate on the matter but this is the first occasion on which statements will be made and questions put.  It is not right that the Taoiseach will be unavailable to take questions.  After all, he headed this endeavour and he stands over the treaty on behalf of the Government.  Irrespective of other engagements, he ought to be here to answer questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I am also prepared to sign the agreement.  I already answered the Deputy's questions on the matter directly during Leaders' Questions.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	118	In fact he did not answer my questions.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	130	How can the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, answer questions when she was not at the meeting?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	131	This is purely technical.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	132	She was not, by definition.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Is it agreed that an additional five minutes be given to the main spokespersons for Fianna FÃ¡il, Sinn FÃ©in and the Technical Group?  Agreed.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I ask the Taoiseach when the HSE governance Bill will be brought before the House because it has been a long time since the HSE board was disbanded by the Minister for Health.  As we witnessed this morning, there is an absence of detailed planning on front line services to deal with the exodus from the health service.  It is important that a clear governance structure is put in place for health services.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	136	It is not true to say there is an absence of planning.  There is a clear and concentrated focus on the pressure points that will emerge and the facilities being made available to deal with them and keep front line services at the highest standard that people expect.  The agency governance Bill will be produced in this session.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	137	When will time be provided for statements from the Taoiseach and a debate on the scheme of early retirement from the public sector and the implications it will have for the front line?  The Taoiseach did not - yet again - answer in a concrete fashion the questions put to him this morning on the matter.  If his Government has plans or a strategy for dealing with this issue, at what stage will he set out before the DÃ¡il the number of exits and proposed recruits and the manner in which vital front line services will be protected?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	138	That is not a matter of promised legislation.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has already answered questions on this matter in great depth and he will continue to do so.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	139	He has not.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	140	As I stated this morning in response to Deputy Martin's question, there is a central planning unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Every line Minister is addressing the question of the actual number of people who will be leaving the public service.  I have pointed out that several thousand people leave the public service every year in normal circumstances.  This is the conclusion of a decision-making process where people, themselves, decide to leave and obviously the flexibility of the Croke Park agreement will now be tested in terms of redeployment and the mobility of staff to continue to provide services that are critical for the people.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Can I take it that the Taoiseach takes no responsibility for this matter-----

While waiting times have improved, in the case, for instance, of nurses getting part-time work, the Garda vetting is not transferable from one position to the other which is causing considerable delays.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Deputy is correct in what he says about waiting times having improved.  This is a sensitive matter and rightly so.  That Bill is expected during this session.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	148	What is the status of the residential tenancy Bill and the landlord and tenant Bill?  Changes are taking place in the social welfare support going into the rental sector and I am concerned that this could lead to a further deterioration in the rental standards open to some tenants.  The swift implementation of those Bills would be important in that regard.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	149	This was considered.  Obviously there is a requirement to deal with a number of Bills that are time-lined here because of the memorandum of understanding.  Both the residential tenancy Bill and the landlord and tenant Bill are scheduled for later on this year.  I will have the Minister give the Deputy a more exact timeline on that.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Yesterday the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, revealed details of the taxi review, which, I am sure, the Cabinet has reviewed.  It contains approximately 46 recommendations.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I remind the Deputy that we are dealing with promised legislation.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am coming to it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I am just reminding him.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The programme for Government indicated that legislation would be introduced fairly quickly.  This industry has a myriad of problems and the legislation is urgently needed.  Will it be brought forward very quickly?  I do not want to hear it will be some time in 2012 - we need to address the matter as urgently as possible.  Can the Taoiseach give us any sort of date?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	155	On the same subject, can the Taoiseach arrange a debate in the House in the next few weeks in order to discuss the report of the taxi review group and to allow the Minister of State to outline the legislation he proposes to introduce?While I know the Taoiseach has been busy in the past week or so, does he have any news for the young men and women of Priory Hall?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, brought three reports to the Cabinet yesterday, one on smarter travel in towns, one on an integrated rural transport scheme, and one dealing with taxis.  This is an issue about which everybody here is concerned.  Based on the system outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, I want to see those involved in the taxi business, who have pride in the work they do, maintain their high reputation.  I am concerned about illegal operators.  Many thousands of parents are very concerned about their young girls and boys getting into the wrong taxi, which might not be legitimate in the first place.  The recommendations made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, need to be discussed by those involved in the industry.  They have been endorsed by the Cabinet and I want to see them implemented in a way whereby those involved in the taxi business, who work very hard, can maintain their very high standard of professionalism and reputation as it should be.  Cowboy operators need to be taken out of the system so that they neither impinge on legitimate operators nor do down the reputation of the country by offering inferior services, about which, in some cases, people have legitimate reason to be concerned.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	160	It is on its way.  I would say it would be in the next couple of weeks and certainly in this session.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has gone through the structure and model for it.  The Bill will be in here as quickly as we can - obviously it is of importance.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	161	In response to a parliamentary question on vehicle testing centres, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, stated: "It is envisaged that the RSA will take over responsibility for licensing and supervising commercial vehicle testing in the near future when the required legislative provisions are in place."  When will that happen?As the Taoiseach is aware, constitutional law is a minefield considering what is going on at present with regard to the controversy over the fiscal treaty.  Is there proposed legislation to protect the rights of rural children to be treated equally with children in other areas-----

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Deputy was going grand until the second item, which is totally out of order but could be a matter for a parliamentary question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I do not have a timeline on that - I will have a response sent to the Deputy.  In regard to the issue of children, obviously the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is working on a referendum in respect of child protection.  In a general sense, while we might assume that all the children of the nation are supposed to be treated equally, in reality we have been very far from that in a number of areas for many years and we would like to rectify that if we could.

I got further calls today informing me that their P45s were-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Come on - this is not promised legislation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	170	-----not done properly by KPMG and have been refused by Revenue.  In that context there is an urgent need to introduce industrial relations legislation to prevent such shoddy treatment of workers.  Given all that has happened in recent weeks, does the Government plan to introduce new industrial relations legislation to prevent the kind of mistreatment of workers we have seen with the La Senza workers?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Is there legislation promised?

The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has an interest in this and his officials have always been available to trade union officials.  At the end of the day, the LRC machinery is there.  I hope these can be used to solve this dispute and others.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I suggest that the Deputy tables a parliamentary question on the issue and we can have a proper discussion.

Obviously there is a difference between a DÃ¡il debate and an investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I suggest he raises it at the Whips' meeting and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be flexible in his response.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	193	That would be one in a row.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I welcome this opportunity to brief the House on what was an important meeting for Europe and for Ireland.  Progress was made on two key issues of vital interest to us: the jobs and growth agenda and the new fiscal compact treaty.  The outcome represents an important contribution to moving Europe beyond crisis, helping to restore stability and confidence to our economy and putting the urgent need for job-creating growth at the top of the agenda.As I told the European Council meeting on Monday, since this Government took office our absolute priority has been to secure Ireland's economic recovery and to ensure employment for our people.  The meeting highlighted how vital it is that this work is advanced seamlessly at national and European level.  There can be no difference in approach.  All our priorities must be aligned, our policy approaches must match and they must be driven forward with equal commitment and energy.  Our membership of the European Union and playing a full, active and influential part at its heart is an essential part of the work that must be done if Ireland is to get back to where it seeks to be.  I assure the House that I have personally ensured every Minister is alive to this vital task and fully engaged in this work.  I have put in place new arrangements at official level in my Department to ensure that there is full coherence throughout the system and that every opportunity for Ireland to advance its case and its interests at European level is seized and used to maximum effect.The outcome from Monday's meeting is a clear demonstration that our approach is working and that it is delivering results.  Yesterday's discussion of growth and jobs was lengthy and important.  There was a constructive and serious atmosphere in the room and I believe there is now a real appreciation at the highest level of European politics of the urgent need to focus fully on growth-generating policies not only as a counter-balance to discipline and austerity, but as an essential element of any sustainable programme of recovery.  As I told the DÃ¡il last week, Ireland, along with several like-minded member states, submitted two papers in advance of the meeting, one identifying measures with real potential to deliver growth and the other focused on the digital Single Market, especially copyright issues.These represented an important input to the text eventually agreed.  To make our discussions as practical and concrete as possible, President Van Rompuy asked us to focus on three key areas: unemployment, especially among young people; the Single Market; and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  In advance of the meeting, he asked several colleagues to prepare presentations on these issues and I was asked to make a presentation on the role of SMEs in driving economic recovery.We heard from President Barroso, who gave a detailed presentation on the extensive range of policy initiatives being advanced by the European Commission.  He considered several possible growth scenarios for the EU and what we might do to improve our situation.  His presentation was sobering to say the least, particularly his presentation on the extent of youth unemployment throughout the European Union which has reached levels as high as 50% in Spain.  As President Barroso set out in his statement after the summit, the Commission will now establish action teams to work with member states in which above average rates of youth unemployment apply.  This includes Ireland and the intention is to improve job opportunities for young people.Several Prime Ministers were asked to introduce key topics to inform the debate.  As the Danish Prime Minister holds the Presidency, she focused on legislative work on priority initiatives and the need for the new budget for the EU, the multi-annual financial framework, to promote growth and employment.  The Austrian Chancellor spoke on stimulating employment, the Estonian Prime Minister addressed the Single Market and the Finnish Prime Minister focused in particular on the digital Single Market.In the course of my contribution I set the scene on SMEs, focusing on what we have been doing in Ireland in this regard.  I pointed to two key concerns, ensuring access to finance and reducing red tape, which must be addressed if SMEs, the engines of economic recovery, are to be able to fulfil their potential.  I highlighted some of the key steps we are taking in Ireland, including our forthcoming jobs action plan; the partial guarantee scheme and micro-financing loan fund; and the strategic investment fund.  All of these will help to supplement bank lending.I also stressed that in return for the money we put in to the banks to recapitalise them, we insist that they deliver for the real economy.  We will ensure this materialises through our monthly monitoring of lending targets and patterns and the establishment of the Credit Review Office.  I described how we are taking a highly targeted approach in our initiatives, including the reduction of VAT on tourism services, the cut in PRSI for employers of low earners and the reform of our bankruptcy laws, aiming specifically at measures most likely to contribute to growth and recovery.  I also pointed to our encouragement of new and innovative companies.  This takes place through ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises can access research and development funding and providing a sales and marketing tax credit to companies exporting to new markets in emerging economies, including the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.  I suggested that we should seek to learn from others about what does and does not work by exchange of best practice and that we should return to the discussion in June.  This is reflected in the final paragraph of the statement agreed on Monday evening.Reaching agreement on the new treaty at Monday's meeting was another important milestone.  However, as a result of the considerable work that was put into negotiating and preparing the text ahead of Monday's meeting the political discussion on this element was a good deal shorter than our discussion of growth.  While much, if not most, of the treaty is already provided for in the EU treaties and existing EU law, including the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact as strengthened by the six legislative measures adopted last year, setting out the measures in a new treaty takes the process to a new level by ensuring that everyone will play by the rules and will be held to account if they do not.  As a small member state of the union, this is in Ireland's interests.  There have been occasions in the past when it has been easier for large member states in particular to evade their responsibilities.  Under the new treaty this will no longer be possible.Now that we have a final text it might be helpful for me to set out some of its main features to the House.  The new treaty entitled the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union opens with a long set of preambles.  I highlight the 20th preamble, which makes it clear that "none of the provisions of this Treaty is to be interpreted as altering in any way the economic policy conditions under which financial assistance has been granted to a Contracting Party in a stabilisation programme...".  This is an important provision which ensures that for Ireland and other programme countries, the terms of our EU IMF programme will prevail and that the new agreement will only apply once we have exited from the programme.Among the articles of the treaty, I highlight Article 2 which aims to ensure full consistency with EU treaties.  The statement that the treaty is to be applied and interpreted "in conformity with the Treaties on which the European Union is founded" is welcome and something Ireland actively sought, as is the assertion that "They shall not encroach on the competences of the Union to act in the area of economic union".Another feature worth noting is the carefully balanced language on measurement of structural deficits in Article 3.1, one of the priority issues for Ireland that I have identified previously in the House.  The final language in this regard reflects Irish concerns that the approach should take into account an overall assessment with the structural balance as a reference and that it should reflect country-specific aspects.  This is important to a small, open economy like ours.  Similarly, the language of Article 3.2, which sets out what is required to enact the new deficit brake at national level, reflects Irish input.We need to ensure that member states fully adhere to and respect the new rules in deciding on and implementing their budgets.  Equally, however, it is important that the text recognises that law making processes and traditions - including at a constitutional level - vary from country to country and must be accommodated when we agree to act together.  This has always been the case in the conduct of European business.  The final text is a balanced one that Ireland can accept.Article 13 provides an important new role for national parliaments, who will, together with the European Parliament, organise and promote a conference of representatives of their relevant committees to discuss budgetary policies and other issues covered by the treaty.  I know this will be welcomed by the House.  The arrangements for entry into force are set out in Article 14.  This provides that the treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, providing that 12 euro area member states have ratified it.  Member states will then have a further year to transpose its contents into their national law.I appreciate the great interest that there is in what will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the new treaty.  At our meeting yesterday, the Government agreed that the TÃ¡naiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, should write to the Attorney General seeking her formal views in the matter.  This is the norm when we are looking at an international treaty.  There is no formal deadline.  The Attorney General must be given the time she needs to undertake this detailed and important work.  As I have said before, the Government will not shirk its duties.  It will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that Ireland is in a position to ratify the treaty, including a referendum if necessary.   I will keep the House fully briefed and involved in this important work.I reiterate my welcome for this new treaty.  Its shared currency rules, and the ability to enforce them, are of vital importance.  The arrangements make it possible to hold all member states, including the largest, to account in a way that has not previously been possible.  I would equally acknowledge that it cannot be seen in any way as a sufficient response to the crisis currently facing Europe, nor was it intended to.  In order to get beyond our current difficulties, we also need an urgent focus on growth-enhancing policies.  Monday's statement on this and the recognition that growth issues must feature on all future agendas for meetings of the European Council is an important and significant step forward.It is also clear that the situation in Greece remains fragile.  At our meeting, we heard from Prime Minister Papademos on progress in the negotiations on private sector involvement, PSI, and on a new programme.  The troika's assessment is that Greece is making real efforts, but that more remains to be done.For as long as member states remain exposed to extreme pressure in the markets, we will need to ensure that we have strong and credible firewalls in place.  I am, therefore, very pleased that Monday's meeting reiterated our agreement to come back to reassess the adequacy of the resources available under the EFSF and the ESM when we meet again at the beginning of March.  This will be an important discussion, including for Ireland.  While we are making progress in our recovery, we remain vulnerable to negative developments elsewhere.  In this regard, I welcome the fact that colleagues reiterated their view that positive progress is being made by Ireland and that they will continue to provide support to countries under a programme until they have regained market access.  This is an important reassurance as we work towards that important goal.  This statement was included in the conclusions of the meeting and in the communication thereafter.The road ahead for Ireland and Europe is long and difficult.  Recovery will not be built in a day or at a single meeting.  However, on Monday we took important steps in the right direction and I will be ensure that my colleagues deliver on what they have agreed and that our undertakings are turned into concrete actions in the period ahead.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Over the next few months there will be much debate on the ratification of the fiscal treaty to which the Taoiseach agreed on Monday.  This is already shaping up to be a destructive process solely focused on the form of ratification rather than on the future of Europe and our role in it.  For the first time since we applied to join the Union 50 years ago, we begin this debate without basic information being publicly available and without even the most elementary consensus between parties positive towards the European Union.There is great danger that the approach to date and the pushing through of this treaty without any public engagement will do lasting damage to the standing of the Union in Ireland.  For the sake of rushing through this treaty, we could damage the possibility of ever again winning support for an EU initiative.  Given that this treaty commits us to a major new EU treaty in the next few years, this is an urgent concern.It has been a bad year for Europe.  Never before have its citizens been in such need of assistance and never before has the Union seemed less able to provide it.  This is a defining moment in the Union's history.  In the face of an unprecedented crisis, it must find new ways forward.  Developments of long-standing policies simply are not good enough.  The public demands answers and it our duty in this House to speak directly and constructively.  We must speak hard truths, but must also show people that we are pushing credible solutions.  The flaws in the way this treaty was negotiated, its contents and its ratification are so significant that they must be talked about.  However, we cannot leave it at that; we need something more positive.The issues discussed and agreed on Monday are at very best a small step.  No matter how good the presentation of it is, this treaty and the measures agreed on Monday do not show the public that a solution is in hand on Europe's crisis.  The measures are not radical enough and they do not tackle the urgent need to reform the ECB and expand European investment.  While commentators talk about a theoretical possibility of new flexibility, in reality there is nothing more on the Union's agenda.  The approach to EU issues in this House since the election has involved more heat than light.  There is more time available for speeches, but there has been a refusal to provide information or respond to direct questions.  We urgently need to change this.  We need a genuine effort to find consensus among those who want the Union to work and we need this effort to start now.Before addressing the real substance of the summit, I reiterate that the broad thrust of discussions on Monday about support for SMEs and redirecting funding must be welcomed.  What is not welcome is the attempt to over-spin their significance.  Completing the Single Market in areas such as services will help the broader European economy in the medium term.  Hopefully, this in-principle agreement will become more definite in the near future.  I hope too that the Taoiseach has the Labour Party on board in terms of services across the European Union, because it is not so long since it labelled the services directive as a Frankenstein.As for the redirected Structural Funds, a similar reallocation has been a part of this funding for at least two decades.  The reapportionment of funding not drawn-down is a basic principle of funding and has helped it to be highly effective in the past.  This is a process from which Ireland has always benefited because our unfairly maligned public servants are among the most effective and efficient in Europe in implementing support programmes.  What is really needed is new funding which can help countries currently unable to invest in job creation in spite of growing unemployment.  If an initiative is not large enough to merit changing unemployment forecasts, it should not be presented as a major initiative.  Over-claiming the significance of what was agreed on Monday will just feed disillusionment as people fail to see the impact of the measures in the near future.Over the past twelve months, the European Council has held an unprecedented number of meetings.  These meetings have mostly been held in the middle of a crisis and have always been followed by claims about decisive action and returning confidence.  After all of the effort which has been put into these meetings, we are still faced with the fact that growth is falling, the cost of funding public services is rising and unemployment is at its highest ever level.  Take, for example, the statements following any of last year's summits and compare them to what happened afterwards and it is clear that the European Council is failing.  It is failing to restore confidence, it is failing to show leadership and, worst of all, it is failing to respect the spirit of solidarity on which the greatest international body in history was built.  The reason it is failing is simple.  This crisis involves radically new challenges, yet the Council has tried to tackle them with a set of incremental changes to existing policies.  Every initiative has been delayed and others have been pushed in the face of evidence that they were not working.  At Europe's hour of need, its leaders have been timid and obsessed with domestic political manoeuvring.The economic impact of this has been very serious.  Confidence and the ability of states to invest for recovery have been undermined.  Just as serious, and with the potential to cause long-term problems, has been the damage to the standing of the Union with its citizens.  2011 saw the sustained destruction of public confidence in the EU.  Since these issues began to be measured 35 years ago, there has never been such a dramatic and concentrated fall in sentiment towards the EU.  Only 19% believe that the Union is heading in the right direction, while a majority say the opposite.  This is not just about a eurosceptic fringe, but a factor throughout the Union, and most disturbingly it is now a factor in this country.  Measured against figures taken just before this Government took up office, by last November the Irish public had moved suddenly to a negative view of Europe's direction.  Sentiment declined by an unprecedented 38%.  During three years of crisis this sentiment had remained strong, but it collapsed last year in the face of growing despair at the failures of Europe's leaders.The consensus in this country has consistently been that people believe in the EU as a positive force.  This has not always been the same as supporting EU treaties, but the reflexive anti-EU suspicions of its consistent opponents have never been a mainstream view of citizens.  My fear is that if we do not quickly restore trust and confidence in the Union, then we run the risk of damaging its democratic legitimacy.  The old arguments and cries to just rally to the cause have nothing to offer.  In fact they are making matters worse, because they seek to deny legitimate concerns.It is impossible to comment on the content of the agreed treaty without addressing the process by which it was developed and by which Ireland agreed to it.  At European level, even the most basic groundwork has not been done to show the logic behind individual provisions of this treaty.  Public debate was discouraged and a handful of bilateral summits were allowed to replace inclusive negotiations.  The Taoiseach is not alone among his peers in having failed to undertake a detailed series of meetings with others.  After three years of an economic crisis, a rising sovereign debt crisis made it clear that Europe needed new policies.  It created bailout funds but struggled with the agenda of how to prevent the need for bailouts.  Policies which forced Ireland and then Portugal out of the bond markets have been continued, with other countries surviving only due to indirect and probably unsustainable support.The lack of stronger fiscal controls did not cause the crisis, but the narrow agenda of one country has made it the main focus of the proposed solution.  Given that Ireland would have comfortably met every provision of this treaty in the decade before the crisis, no one has yet explained how the treaty would have prevented it.Negotiations were not inclusive and they fostered acrimony and a lack of ownership of the outcome.  It should be a concern to everyone that this is the first time in the Union's history that a treaty will not be signed by all of its members.  At home this is the first time that no serious effort was made to seek input to Ireland's negotiating objectives for a treaty, and the first time when these objectives were not outlined in detail for the public.  Long before December's text was negotiated, I wrote to the Taoiseach seeking engagement.  He refused, saying that he saw no benefit from it.  After he had already agreed the principles of the treaty, he called a meeting of all groups at which he gave no new information and he has failed to follow up a specific request from me for an analysis of the economic impact of what is proposed.  In contrast, previous Governments of different make-ups were far more open.  First of all, parties were given the basic respect of separate meetings when they were sought.  Former Taoiseach John Bruton and former TÃ¡naiste Dick Spring kept the Opposition fully informed in the Amsterdam treaty negotiations.  For the constitutional treaty and Lisbon, the Opposition actually participated in the development of Ireland's negotiating position.The Taoiseach will know that I was fully open with his spokespeople during the consultations I held while preparing the revised Lisbon proposal.  They were given repeated briefings and the ability to make submissions which were incorporated into Government positions.  Deputies Timmins and Costello made contributions to the final proposal and ensured that the mainstream pro-EU consensus survived.  If the Taoiseach wants a constructive ratification debate he needs to begin respecting the fact that there are legitimate, pro-EU reasons for being concerned about this treaty.We said last year, before any other party, that a core principle needed to be followed for the ratification of this treaty.  If it involves any significant change then the people should be consulted.  It has been clear for a long time that the Government wanted to avoid a referendum at all costs and Ministers have briefed extensively that they expect to be told that a referendum is not required.  Today's newspapers reveal that the Taoiseach's claim to have no concern about holding a referendum is nonsense.  At all stages of the negotiating process, the avoidance of a public vote was the primary objective for the Government.The Taoiseach is now backing himself into the corner of arguing that the treaty is powerful enough to save the euro, but not significant enough to require a vote of the people.  This approach is one which instinctively and rightly alienates people.  Is it not a terrible indictment of the leaders of Europe that the Irish courts will soon hear State lawyers argue that this is a treaty which is too insignificant to require a vote?  Does it not say something deeply depressing that our Government's position is that an unprecedented crisis is being met within existing policy limits?The Taoiseach is well aware that there were people pushing the idea of parliamentary ratification of the revised Lisbon proposal.  I and others refused to agree to this because we saw that such a move could cause permanent damage to the public's support for the EU.  It was rightly decided to let the people decide.  This position was supported by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in this House and in the campaign.  Sinn FÃ©in was true to its 40 year record of attacking every single EU treaty change and worked to use the referendum to promote itself rather than any constructive proposal.  The manoeuvring we have seen from Sinn FÃ©in and other anti-EU groups is entirely based on wanting to have something to campaign against.My party yesterday commissioned an independent legal opinion which will deal with both the ratification process and, more importantly, the actual legal impact of the final text.  I was disappointed that the Taoiseach did not refer to any issues arising out of the treaty in this context.  In particular, he referenced article 3.2.  This article refers to creating a scenario which is binding and of permanent character, which would appear to restrict the capacity of future DÃ¡ileanna to change position in terms of the parameters of this treaty.  I would have been interested in the Taoiseach's comments on that, even if he is awaiting the advice of the Attorney General.

However, there is a more fundamental point at issue here.  Can we stand over a process where the people have been excluded at every stage of negotiation and ratification?  The public has not only not been consulted; they have been ignored.  Equally, the major policy omissions in the treaty are also too big to ignore.If this treaty is the end of the debate on the structural reform of the economic and monetary rules of the European Union, then the public must be consulted.  It is clear that the Taoiseach will come back in a few weeks to say that ratification through the Oireachtas is likely to survive the various legal challenges which will immediately be launched.  Is he willing to come back with a much more significant proposal which shows the people that they are being listened to?I have said consistently before that our major problem with the treaty is that it does not go far enough.  It elevates a side issue, the imposition of fiscal controls, to a central position and ignores the agenda Europe needs.  The Fianna FÃ¡il Party supports a significant increase in the economic role of the European Union.  In response to the crisis, Ireland has favoured greater federalism in key areas.  While this marks a departure from the Irish position of the past 20 years, it is the only reasonable way to respond to the crisis.There are two major reforms without which this crisis will not be overcome and the predictions of long-term austerity will be realised.  The European Central Bank is designed for the German economy of the 1970s and has failed as a central bank for a diverse currency union.  The need to change its mandate and expand its bond buying options is more important than any single item on our national agenda.  Greater fiscal union, which Fianna FÃ¡il supports in principle, can only work if it involves a commitment to significant transfers within the Union.  A union which controls a budget of 1% of collective income is not and will not be a fiscal union.  We need to challenge the advocates of a control led solution as without increased investment, there will be no growth.  These matters were not seriously discussed in preparing the treaty.  They were not pushed by Ireland or other countries which were intimidated by the strength of the fiscal control agenda.If we want to renew public confidence in the European Union, we must renew our approach to working together on European policy.  The lengthy tradition of the pro-European Union parties consulting on the national approach to negotiations was abandoned and there has been too much partisanship.  I appeal directly to the Taoiseach to work on forging a new pro-EU consensus, one which is based on taking people's fears seriously and promotes an agenda ambitious enough to tackle a crisis of this scale.As I have stated repeatedly during the past year, I believe in the great European ideal as the best and perhaps only route to sustained prosperity for the people of Ireland and Europe.  I am the only party leader to have gone beyond generalities by setting out an economic case for saving the euro.  My party's gut reaction to the European Union has always been and will always be that we see it as a solution rather than a problem, and as empowering sovereignty rather than threatening it.  Our core instinct is to support common initiatives, even if we believe they are not perfect.  We will not take any position which will damage the standing of the European Union and its ability to work on behalf of its citizens.Instead of letting Monday be the point from which everyone is summoned to take opposing positions, we need a real discussion about the way forward.  The treaty must become a part of a wider series of urgent initiatives which are capable of tackling the crisis.  As no wider action agenda has been promoted, the treaty is currently a stand-alone measure and the end of a process.  If the Taoiseach agrees that any solution to the economic crisis must involve the European Union, he cannot keep to this position.  To do so would be a betrayal of the hopes and urgent needs of the citizens of this State and the European Union as a whole.  There is no credibility in promising that something will eventually happen once the treaty is ratified.  It must not be ratified in a manner that is dismissive of the public.  Once we lose the foundation of pro-European Union sentiment among the people, we will not get it back.  Once we use legal devices to avoid any public consultation on the treaty, it will be almost impossible to get more urgent changes adopted.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The Taoiseach and leaders from 24 other European Union member states agreed to a new austerity treaty which will mean imposing savage austerity on the citizens of this State and citizens across Europe for years to come.  It is not a real surprise that the Taoiseach supported this treaty as he has long signalled support for the austerity approach despite its devastating social consequences.In recent days, the Taoiseach stated he had "no fear or concern or anxiety" about the prospect of a referendum on the treaty.  The major focus of the Government's negotiation strategy throughout this entire process has been to avoid the necessity to hold a referendum.  If he has nothing to fear from this process and is so confident about the austerity treaty, why does he not stop hiding behind the Attorney General and put the text to the people?  The Government should hold a referendum on the eurozone austerity treaty irrespective of the legal advice given by the Attorney General.Sinn FÃ©in believes the treaty, if ratified, will have a profound impact on the Irish economy and people for decades to come.  Recent opinion polls confirm that the overwhelming majority of the electorate supports our view.  A massive 72% believe a referendum is necessary.  It is clear, therefore, that people want to have their say on this matter.  The Government does not have a mandate to sign up to a treaty which will have such serious implications for the future.  It must do the right thing and hold a referendum.Sinn FÃ©in has argued that austerity is not the answer to this crisis but part of the problem.  What is needed is a strategy for jobs and growth through stimulus.  While European Union leaders seem to have finally woken up to this reality and discussed these issues at their summit, not one additional cent has been allocated to job creation.  Rather than announcing new plans or providing new money for job creation, all that emerged from the meeting was a rehash of existing plans and money.The so-called debt brake of 0.5% of GDP will heap yet more austerity on people in Ireland.  It will result in the hand-over of significant control of fiscal and budgetary matters to unelected and unaccountable EU officials.  The austerity treaty is bad for Ireland and Europe.  Rather than stabilising the euro, it will make matters worse.  In seeking to impose drastic and destructive austerity policies into perpetuity the Government is signing all of us up to budgets that involve savage cuts for its full term of office and beyond.What is completely absent from the treaty are any moves towards debt restructuring.  Last week, the Taoiseach told the world that the people of Ireland went mad borrowing and this led to the economic crisis.  The reality was that Irish banks went mad borrowing cheap money from European banks.  They did so to make a profit and because they were greedy.  Their actions drove house prices ever higher, forcing citizens to borrow large amounts of money simply to buy a place to live.  These self-same banks are now being bailed out by the taxpayer at a colossal cost of â¬63 billion.Last week in the DÃ¡il, the Taoiseach stated he did not want to have the word "defaulter" written "on our foreheads" and he had not sought a debt write-down.  The point is that the banking debt is not the people's debt and should not be paid.  Did the Taoiseach raise this issue at the European Council meeting?

This response is having devastating social consequences, not only in Ireland but across the European Union.  Despite an endless round of crisis summits, a massive transfer of moneys from taxpayers to banks and the austerity treaty, the response to the crisis is not working.  Youth unemployment is at crisis level, with nearly one third of young people in Ireland and almost half of Spanish young people out of work.  Thousands of young people have to leave the State every week to try to make a living elsewhere.  What does the future hold for them?  Where is the hope for them?  As a man from the west, the Taoiseach is aware of the impact of emigration and the shadow it casts on the small, rural communities dotted across the west.  He knows about the empty seats at dinner tables during the Christmas period just passed and the tears shed at airports.  We do not want to hear Ministers describe emigration as a lifestyle choice again.Sinn FÃ©in believes Ireland's place is in Europe.  Co-operation with our European partners is essential if we are to meet the challenges facing us in the time ahead.  In attempting to portray the choice before Irish people as one of accepting the austerity treaty or leaving the euro the Government is simply scaremongering.  The scenario it presents is incorrect because Ireland's position as a member of the eurozone is secure irrespective of what position we take on the treaty.  The real question facing the DÃ¡il and citizens is whether this treaty is a good deal for Ireland and Europe.  Sinn FÃ©in firmly believes the answer to that question is a negative.In regard to Article 3.2, as the Taoiseach knows, the language in the first draft was very clear at the insistence of Angela Merkel's Government that we shall transpose these agreements into the constitution or equivalent legislation.  The first draft was very clear about what Chancellor Merkel's Government wanted.  The Taoiseach's colleague, the TÃ¡naiste, speaking at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs, confirmed - the Taoiseach refused to do so today, so I will clarify the matter for him - that our negotiators, clearly at the instruction of either the Taoiseach or the TÃ¡naiste, presumably both, actively sought to weaken that text and to put in the words "preferably constitutional" in order to avoid the requirement to put this proposition before the people.  However, the words "binding" and "permanent" are still there.  All of the draconian austerity measures, which will go beyond this troika package, are still there, as are all the implications.  The only change which the Taoiseach secured was to prevent the people having their say on this issue.  That is outrageous and shameful.Then we had the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, tell us that in these debates, people tend to focus on all sorts of things.  They might focus on septic tanks, bank bailouts and other such issues.  This is an 11 page document.  Even if some of his points were accepted, it is not the Lisbon treaty or the Nice treaty.  The issues are clear, they can be argued clearly and can be accessible to our people.  There is no justification for not putting this before the people because the implications are so profound.  That is what the Taoiseach achieved in the negotiations.  The only thing he achieved in terms of Chancellor Merkel's crazy austerity-driven approach is to prevent the people having their say.Austerity has not worked.  If the Taoiseach does not want to take Sinn FÃ©in's word for it, I am sure he will take the word of the IMF.  The IMF recently published a report which looked at austerity over the past 30 years and 173 different case studies.  All that austerity has done, in the absence of some growth strategy, is drive up unemployment and make conditions extremely harsh.  This is a mad strategy and I have yet to hear one economist say it can possibly work or, as the Taoiseach said was his objective, get Ireland back to work, or make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  How in the name of God will he achieve that by signing up to this document without any plan for growth, without any sense of investment and without any real economic approach or outline plan?If the Taoiseach is not happy with the IMF, I will give him some more examples.  Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize winning economist and the person the Taoiseach called a "commentator" - commentators comment when the Taoiseach is over in Davos where he said the people went mad borrowing - travels the world-----

I should not ask any further questions until Question Time.  I will not ask the Taoiseach any further questions for about 20 minutes but I will talk about George Soros and report to this House what he said.  George Soros said this austerity approach would condemn Europe into a deflationary debt spiral.  The Taoiseach knows all of this.  Some eminent people who he respects - whatever he thinks about Sinn FÃ©in's perspective - are telling him that this whole approach is crazy.The European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion said that by purely cutting wages, competitiveness does not improve.  He also said that we must also invest in the labour force and that a more balanced approach, more solitary and cohesion among member states is needed because to end the crisis, Europe cannot rely solely on austerity measures.  I could go on in regard to these matters, and I will get some opportunity now because we have a new Acting Chairman.Let me present some solutions.  I have already given the Taoiseach a copy of our proposals and analysis.  I do not know if he had the chance to read it on the way-----

There are the issues of the crisis of investment and the crisis of the role of European Central Bank.  How can the European Central Bank play a more constructive role in solving this crisis?  There are also the issues of debt restructuring and of the management of this crisis and the banking crisis throughout Europe.Let us deal with the first one because the Taoiseach asked for solutions and constructive debate.  Let me give him Sinn FÃ©in's constructive contribution in case he did not have the opportunity to read what I gave him.  In terms of the investment crisis, we have a National Pensions Reserve Fund with â¬5.3 billion.  When the Sinn FÃ©in leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, the deputy leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I met the troika, we probed this issue of utilising the European Investment Bank's immense resources.  The bank has a strong track record in terms of investment and return, so it is a fairly prudent and strategic way to invest money.  We should combine the resources of the European Investment Bank with our National Pensions Reserve Fund and utilise that to invest in various projects, for example, the roll-out of next generation broadband.  Recently, Deputies and Senators from all parties watched a presentation on the potential this would unleash in this country.  I could go on but that is just one element.  We need to unleash the potential of the European Investment Bank in a serious way.The little document which was used as window dressing to the austerity treaty has no new money or no new plans.  It is a reconfiguration of existing ideas.  We need a dramatic intervention and a real message of hope, jobs and growth to be sent to people throughout Europe, in particular, in the interest of the Taoiseach, to people in Ireland.  That is the first element in terms of investment.The second element is the banking system.  Let us have a bit of honesty about this.  There must be rigorous stress testing of the core European banks because we have not had it to date.  We know they behaved recklessly and were utilised strategically to take that trade surplus and wealth in Germany and other states to invest it in the periphery, whether a bad investment in the Greek Government or an appallingly bad investment in the private Irish banks.  We know they have caused this crisis and that it was not caused by the people going mad borrowing.  We know there was a fundamental lack of regulation in the international financial system which was not just limited to Europe.  We know it happened in the US also.  When will we have rigorous stress testing of those banks and then some deleveraging?  We can then recapitalise when we know where we stand.  We have had some tinkering around the edges.  This is the core issue that Sinn FÃ©in believes these states are afraid of.  When we go to that issue, we get to the root of the problem.  However, there is no Government solution to address it, other than to say that we must have more austerity.The third element, after investment and banking, is sovereign debt.  We must have a real discussion about how Ireland, Greece and other countries will sustain this debt.  Where is the burden sharing?  Where is the pain being felt by the banking system for the calamitous approach it took to global finances?  There has to be a real debate about that.We in Ireland cannot be condemned to these annual â¬3.1 billion promissory notes, nor can we be condemned to continue with these cuts and all the lobbies we have to face.  I am sure if we had more Fine Gael and Labour Deputies here for this debate they would testify that their clinics are packed and their diaries are full of meetings with representations from schools, hospitals and other sectors that say they cannot sustain the cutbacks.  There must be hope for a way out of this situation.When the Taoiseach was first elected to the DÃ¡il all those decades ago, I do not think he ever imagined that he would be presiding over such a scenario.  At some point, he will have to give our people hope.  He will have to go out there and find that Irish spirit, which has been there for generations, to do something about this.  He will have to go in and say, "Folks, enough of the niceties and frivolities - the 500-lb gorilla in the room is this crisis which is not being addressed properly".  He will have to tell Chancellor Angela Merkel that we do not have a crisis because the Irish people went mad borrowing and spending but because political leaders, the global banking system, estate agents and economists, who were paid by the financial institutions, utterly failed our people.When the regular Joe Soaps and five eighths turned on their televisions at home every single night, an economist was telling them they had to buy now because house prices were going to rise further.  Then they said there would be a soft landing.  When they opened their newspapers, there were property supplements about lifestyles and how many houses were for sale.  Our people are not Harvard, Yale or Trinity-educated economists; they are just hard-working, decent people but they were profoundly failed by their political leaders.  When will that conversation take place?  When will we say that those responsible for this will pay a price, like the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland who was stripped of his knighthood?  When will there be a radical realignment of that system, instead of those responsible being rewarded in America as treasury secretaries, and in Europe being appointed as technocrat prime ministers or to the presidency of the ECB?  Those are the very people in Goldman Sachs who drove this crisis.  Mr. Peter Sutherland, a former European Commissioner and Irish Attorney General, is telling us that we should pay our way.  He is not representing the interests of the Irish people, however.  He is representing his pals in Goldman Sachs.  At what point will we confront those who colluded to do so much harm to the people of Ireland, Europe and globally?  The Taoiseach knows that Sinn FÃ©in is right in this analysis.  Why do we give these people a place at the top table?We must allow the European Central Bank to access primary markets and purchase those government bonds.  There has to be a way of deploying the European Investment Bank, the ECB and our collective wisdom to address this crisis and give our people hope.  Sinn FÃ©in does not want to see the destruction of the potential for a social Europe.  Ireland cannot achieve her potential on her own.  We must engage with the outside world in transacting business and building alliances.  We must stand together and challenge injustices, including human rights abuses.  We should be clear that there is a solution in working with our European partners, but at some stage we must collectively challenge those who caused this crisis.  The Taoiseach can be sure that it is not the ordinary people of Mayo, Donegal or Dublin who did so.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	242	A lot has been said about what this fiscal compact means for us and the rest of Europe.  I would like to quote from Martin Wolf's article in the Financial Times today.  He puts it pretty well when he states:The ECB has saved the eurozone from a heart attack.  But its members face a long convalescence, made worse by the insistence that fiscal starvation is the right remedy for feeble patients ... fiscal indiscipline is not all.  Just as it was not the dominant cause of the collapse, but rather sloppy lending and improvident private borrowing, so fiscal discipline is not the cure.  This attempt to vindicate the catastrophic austerity of Heinrich BrÃ¼ning, German chancellor in 1930-1932, is horrifying.  The perspective embodied in the fiscal compact - itself an attempt to revive the failed stability and growth pact - lacks the necessary understanding of the dependence of output in one member country on demand in others, of the role of payments imbalances and of the fact that competitiveness is always relative.There is little doubt that the level of austerity that this brings to the rest of Europe suits Germany more than the other 26 member states.  In fact, it can be argued that not one of the others is very fond of what is being imposed on them by Germany.  The Germans are in control and very few in Europe seem to have the stomach to contradict our masters today.  Regardless of whether we like it, it appears that the politicians no longer run Europe; it is being run by the financial markets and banking institutions.  The latter institutions have probably been the most culpable in the current crisis.  They are the ones who have lost most money and had the poorest business models, yet they are being saved.  We are going to do everything that suits them, rather than those who are suffering at their hands.This treaty definitely enshrines the German model of fiscal and monetarist rigour, as binding on the eurozone.  It almost literally outlaws Keynesian economics.  It was interesting to hear the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, saying on Saturday that "We will only be able to strengthen our common currency if we co-ordinate our policies more closely and are prepared to gradually give up more powers to the EU".  So we are going to give up more powers to the EU, but I do not believe the Government got a mandate for doing that last February.  There is a general election in this country every five years, but I do not think it appropriate that it is the only say the public should have in how things are done here.  Given that the Government parties went into the election with various promises and a different mandate came out of it for them, I do not think they now have a mandate to do this.  Whether it is demanded constitutionally or not, the Government has an obligation to put this matter to the people.  We pretend to live in some form of democracy - a more fitting definition of this democracy is: "You can say what you like, and you do what you're told."  We pretend, however, that it is a little bit more sociable than that, so I do not see how the Government can refuse to give the people a say on this matter.  It is really important to do so.Attending meetings on the household charge in recent weeks, I have noticed the amount of public interest in how the country is being run.  It is fascinating and much greater than I could have anticipated.  The notion that the people are not clued in to what is happening is completely dishonest.  It is not true.  I have been amazed at the level of interest and knowledge that people have all over the country in the current crisis.  They would like a say on this issue.  If this Government wants the mandate to work with this fiscal compact, it must be put to the people.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I agree with nearly everything Deputy Wallace said.  Are the 24 other parliaments sitting today, with their Prime Ministers telling them it is a great victory and relating how they told European leaders the way forward at the Brussels summit on Monday?  This is an agreement dictated by one nation to the rest of us.  This is a German prescription for Europe.  The Taoiseach's speech referred to that period being over and the future being growth, employment and small businesses but he is whistling past the graveyard.  What was so notable about what he said is that what is going to happen in the future was not made specific.  If anyone can tell me how austerity and a stimulus programme can be reconciled, that person should ascend into heaven immediately.  It will not happen and this particular project will suppress growth, not just in Germany but throughout the 27 nations.  Every member state is going back to their people and painting a false picture of the future.  The economy of this country will be dictated by outside forces and in the main by one particular doctrine.  We have accepted that.  The idea that we can paint a picture of future growth, reductions in unemployment and a great future for SMEs is nonsense.  It will not happen and the Taoiseach's refusal to spell out any projections for employment or unemployment indicates that to be the case.  It would be an absurd hostage to fortune and the Department of Finance is projecting an unemployment rate that only comes down marginally during the tenure of the Taoiseach if he continues until 2015 or 2016.  It is not realistic to do that and it would be better if we had a clear and honest message to the Irish people, that there will be very little growth, unless something extraordinary happens, and that this is part of a doctrine that we must adhere to in the future.  That is the depressing message.Yesterday, figures from the Central Bank show that lending to businesses, despite the Government's protestations, fell in December by 1.6%.  The banks protest, along with their colleagues in government, that they have not just set targets but are lending more to businesses.  They are not, they are lending less rather than more.  The problem with the German, Dutch and Austrian agenda, which we are being asked to dance to, is that they are low unemployment areas, with Germany at 8.6%, Austria at 4.1% and the Netherlands at 4.9%.  I said this during Leaders' Questions and I want to expand on it now.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Today, The Irish Times quoted Merkel saying the discussions over the weekend represented a masterpiece.  With the exception of the Taoiseach, not many other people agree with the comment.  Ordinary people across Europe who have been bearing the brunt of austerity have a very different perspective on the discussions taking place.  The title, Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, might be quite a clumsy mouthful but it is a simple proposition.  It is a proposition to enforce institutionalised austerity, which people throughout Europe have been organising against.  Is it any wonder that, in order to bring in these policies, we have seen a shift from democratic rights and entitlements throughout Europe, with the imposition of Governments of technocrats and bankers in Italy and Greece?  The trappings of democracy have been discarded and our Government is no different because the dogs on the street know that the only purpose of the negotiations of the Taoiseachâs team was to manoeuvre a situation whereby Irish people are denied the right to have a say.  Is that because the Government knows so much better than all the plebs sitting at home and has all the answers?  Everyone knows the reason is that the Government is afraid that people suffering under the programmes being initiated will not tolerate the continuance of these policies.  The Government would prefer to take the flak by hiding behind legal manoeuvres in order to avoid a referendum.  However, the Government will not get away with it and it will be put under massive pressure inside and, more particularly, outside the House.  The issues are too important.What is being considered is not a minor tweaking of existing practices; the clear agenda is to institutionalise austerity and undermine democracy.  One of the key provisions is the balanced budget and the attempt to outlaw any deficit greater than 0.5% of GDP.  This is to outlaw expansionary fiscal policy and to enshrine the type of slash and burn policies implemented with such devastating consequences over the past number of years rather than policies of borrowing to invest in public works, create jobs and redevelop the economy.  It is not just the lunatic left fringe that makes these points but also respected economists and Nobel prize-winning economists.  Joseph Stiglitz described the discussions last week as "a mutual suicide pact", "the medieval practice of bloodletting", which will only make the situation for the patient worse.  Any chance of recovery will be severely hindered by this deal.  It would be a disaster to continue the policies that have failed so badly.  A crucial component of this measure is the move to further economic governance, which takes significant budgetary powers from elected Governments to the unelected European Commission and the European Council.  There are also massive fines for those who breach the targets.  There is already a major problem in this country and other so-called democracies with political parties getting elected on a platform, coming to power and then doing the complete opposite of what they were elected to do.  Can we imagine a scenario, against a backdrop of this treaty being voted for, where the same people shrug their shoulders, say there is nothing they can do, that they have no powers, and they are in place as the pet poodles of the European establishment?One of the reasons these measures undermining democracy is being imposed is because governments feel the pressure from mass movements of ordinary people organising against austerity throughout Europe.  Is it any wonder, when one considers the situation in Greece with youth unemployment at 50%?  Surveys show that 91% of households have had a cut in income, the majority of which have taken cuts of 30%, and 78% of families are really struggling.  There was the biggest general strike in Portugal since 1974 and a general strike in Belgium last week.  People throughout Europe are organising against austerity and people in Ireland are no different.  The debate we need is not whether we are in or out of Europe but the type of Europe we should have to serve the interests of the people, rather than to serve the wealthy elite at the top.

They are ripping off this country to pay for the reckless lending of European, particularly French and German banks.  The major European powers have insisted that the liability of Irish banks be absorbed into Irish State or sovereign debt.The very wealthy in all eurozone countries indulged in an orgy of reckless lending, borrowing and fraudulent financial transactions.  Now Ireland and other so-called programme countries, which are deeply indebted, are being unfairly burdened with the consequences forever under this imperialist treaty.  Since coming to power, the Government has claimed its austerity programme is designed to "restore economic sovereignty".  The same Government is now giving away our economic sovereignty forever.  Most commentators agree that under this treaty Ireland will be in the equivalent of an EU-IMF programme in perpetuity.To make matters worse, the Government, like its Fianna FÃ¡il and Green Party predecessor, is determined to place the entire burden of debt and fiscal adjustment on those on low and middle incomes, while huge personal assets remain untaxed and the very wealthy do not pay their fair share in taxation.  It goes without saying that there should and must be a referendum before any such treaty is ratified.  Basic patriotism and loyalty to the interests of the Irish people should require any Irish public representative to call for a "No" vote. It is clear Ireland can stay within the European Union while rejecting this treaty, as the United Kingdom has done.It is interesting to note that not a single Labour Party Deputy is in the House for this important debate.  It is shameful that it should agree to handing over Irish sovereignty to new and old imperialist powers.  It claims James Connolly as its founder.  He advocated the reconquest of Ireland by its own people and the wrenching of economic and political sovereignty from foreign landlords and capitalists.  Now the TÃ¡naiste, Deputy Gilmore, has rejected Connolly by consigning this country to economic servitude to major international capitalists forever.  The replacement of the Labour Party is a matter of the utmost urgency and importance.I want to put on record my support and that of the United Left Alliance for the initiative of the Technical Group in petitioning the President, Michael D. Higgins, to refer any Bill which might arise for consideration by way of referendum by the people.

Yet, one year on the Government is conspiring with EU leaders to deny people a vote on the treaty which will further and substantially dismantle democracy across Europe and lock the citizens of this country and the rest of Europe into a straitjacket of austerity and cutbacks, which would guarantee mass unemployment and emigration for at least a decade if not longer and from which we may never recover.It is extraordinary to hear the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, talk about how the Irish public would not understand the provisions of the treaty and get caught up in extraneous issues.

What will the next move be?  Will we do away with elections altogether because the people do not understand what the sages on the other side of the House do?Let us be absolutely clear about the legal position, no matter how the Government twists and turns to try to get out of it.  The treaty refers to permanent measures.  Permanent means no government can change them.  If that is not an infringement of the constitutional right of the citizens of the country to determine their social and economic future, I do not know what is.  Permanent means permanent and that is what the Government proposes to lock us into.It then tried to cover this with blather about jobs which people are desperate for.  Please explain to me how, if it can impose, as the treaty will require, at least ten years of brutal austerity to meet these targets, it can create jobs and growth?  It is like saying one will save a drowning man while holding his head under water.  People are being suffocated by austerity and cutbacks and are forced onto their backs by the burden of the casino gambling debts of toxic banks.It is unbelievable.  It is not just this economy that has been crushed by austerity.  The economies of Germany and Europe are slowing down.  Every forecaster, including the IMF and ESRI, says the economies in Europe and Ireland are slowing down.  At what point does one realise it is not working and is strangling and crucifying our economy and the European economy?

At a meeting I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government has undertaken any economic impact assessment of the treaty, in terms of its fiscal implications, its broader economic implications for the country and its impact on jobs, and whether he will publish such impact assessments and distribute them to Members of the House.My second point relates to Article 3.2 of the treaty.  The treaty requires fiscal rules to be introduced to Ireland "through provisions of binding force and permanent character".  In effect, this would appear to require the Oireachtas to pass legislation giving permanent effect to these provisions.  The requirement for permanence in the provision of the treaty appears to restrain any Oireachtas from amending or repealing the legislative provisions introduced to give effect to the treaty.The existence of legislation which cannot be amended or repealed is not known in Irish law.  As the Minister of State knows, Article 15.2.1Â° of Bunreacht na hÃireann provides that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  No other legislative authority has the power to make laws for the State.  Can the Minister of State clarify that any future Oireachtas will be entitled to repeal or amend legislation on the statute books that would arise from the ratification of the treaty?

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I thank Deputies for their statements, comments and questions.The question asked by Deputy Ã FearghaÃ­l is connected to that asked by Deputy Martin.  Programme countries such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal have paramount obligations which are taken into account in the treaty and allow for the programmes we are in to take precedence for the time being.  The Government will conduct some form of fiscal analysis and assessment of what will be required beyond the programme but it is too early to say what it will find.  That work will be undertaken, however, and it is already beginning in the Department of Finance.On the question on the binding and permanent nature of the debt brake, it was the intention of the Government, before this treaty was even contemplated, to introduce a fiscal responsibility Bill, a legislative debt brake.  That is what we intend to do.  We believe it will essentially be in line with what is provided for in the treaty.  I disagree absolutely and reject the contention that introducing the measure via legislation, or including wording within the physical compact which allows for alternative ways of introducing the debt brake within different member states, was somehow to try to avoid a referendum in Ireland.There are many different legal systems in the European Union, as the Deputies will know.  Every member state has its own hierarchy of legislation.  In some countries, the constitution can be changed by the parliament, but that is not the case here.  In other countries, there are tiers of legislation, ranging from regulations to other measures, all with different levels of effect.

The power to make, repeal or amend legislation still rests with the Parliament.  If the Parliament were to repeal the legislation, we would be in breach of international obligations.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	265	It is not any convention.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Taoiseach, in his statement, more or less highlighted the fact that the deficit brake and the making of the commitment as binding as possible were very much sought on the Irish side.  He was saying there was Irish input.  The Minister of State is saying there was no fleshing out of the financial consequences of what we were taking on board and she has implied it was too early to do so.  Have we any idea what Ireland will look like in ten years if we make this commitment, bearing in mind the taxes that will be taken from people and the services it will be possible to provide?  Was this matter not considered beforehand?We are told this measure is in conformity with the other treaties of the European Union.  This treaty is obviously intergovernmental.  How could it possibly conform with other treaties of the Union that have a social component?  That social component is completely ignored in favour of an austerity approach that cannot deliver on the social obligations.The Taoiseach set out on Leaders' Questions that the SMEs will comprise a great deliverer of jobs.  We heard from Deputy Ross that there is a decrease in bank lending.  That comes as no surprise to any of us because we hear it all the time from people.  Was the measure really posited as the Irish approach?  Does the Minister of State genuinely believe we are taking all these steps for the SME sector?  For the past 12 months, we have been waiting for the rationalisation of the county enterprise boards.  We are told continually this is imminent, yet there is nothing but red tape.  While the Government is saying it is taking all the steps, I do not see them being taken, and there are many others who do not either.  There is an element of codding the European Union by means of what we are doing.

If the Attorney General advises that a referendum is not required, will the Government publish the rationale therefor?The European Stability Mechanism treaty is a separate agreement between the eurozone members.  Will the Minister of State explain how the second last paragraph in the preamble, which imposes the condition that member states must sign up to the intergovernmental agreement to avail of the provision, can be applied to the European Stability Mechanism?  There are two separate documents.  The European Stability Mechanism is under EU law.The Taoiseach stated in December the Government was working on economic costings.  Will these be made available to the Opposition when they become available?

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	275	That is not my question.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Minister of State should just answer the question.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	278	We have no alternative, as the Deputy well knows, but to work with the programme we have.  We will continue to do so and to comply with the sorts of obligations to which we have signed up.It is true that the treaty is very much anchored in existing EU legislation and treaties.  A stated objective in the text of the treaty is to have a review within five years.  Another objective is that the treaty will ultimately be subsumed into the body of existing EU law.  That is desirable because, at present, two member states are outside the treaty's scope, and 25 member states are likely to sign up.  Our objective is to bring it back within the parameters of existing treaties.  There is nothing new in that almost all of what is contained in the treaty already exists under our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is very much in our interest to make the pact function in a way it has not done since the creation of monetary union.  The biggest problem the eurozone faces is the reality that member states simply flouted the provisions-----

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	280	There was no automatic sanctioning if member states did not comply.  The biggest offenders were the larger member states.  I do not need to repeat that in this Chamber.  The very significant change in the text of this treaty is that those sanctions will now be automatic.  It will not be necessary to achieve a majority of member states to vote in favour of imposing sanctions because it will happen automatically.  As a member of the euro currency - the monetary union - that is absolutely in our interest.If I can project where we will be in ten years time, it is of course our objective to have a stabilised currency which has clear rules and regulations, some of which are contained in this fiscal treaty, with which member states will be obliged to comply.  If we can achieve that sort of stability in the short term, the long-term prospects for the euro zone and for all of the things we have talked about in terms of future prosperity for the people of Europe, job creation and so on, the key to this is investment.  Europe is a deeply unattractive place for investment at the present; indeed, Ireland is one of the few exceptions to that.  Our objective is to put in place a framework, of which this is one element, to stabilise our currency in order to ensure we can set about the very important task of trying to grow.The Government is not, as Deputy Martin tried to suggest earlier, under any illusion that this is the ultimate solution or a solution in its own right.  It is simply an element of a solution.  That is why it is read and perceived in the context of the broader European treaty body of legislation and the European founding treaties, all of which aspire to defending and strengthening the European social model, to which Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred.  While it is extremely important we maintain that objective at the very core of what we are doing at European level, we cannot just pretend this fiscal crisis does not exist, that we do not need to balance our books and that we can continue spending money we simply do not have.  There has to be an element of realism in all of this.  By instilling and enshrining these rules and their enforceability in the broader European legal framework, we will go a long way to doing that.It is not a question of choosing one model or the other.  It is simply a question of binding our ambition to impose rules and regulations, which have been ignored in the past, and to couple them with the social model, the social Europe agenda and, obviously, with the biggest priority of all, which is to get back to a position of growth and job creation.Finally, there was a question in regard to the whole area of SMEs.  There is no question, and I do not believe anybody in Government has ever suggested, that we can solve the major challenge in our domestic economy overnight.  However, we have begun to put in place policies-----

These people are on the budgetary committee of the Bundestag, with a â¬300 billion budget.  I put it to them that the loan losses in our banking system were 60% of our national income or GDP.  If the same problem had arisen in Germany, it would be a â¬300 billion part of its GDP.  We were being asked, silently, to bear this load, which was wrong.

Our private household debt and non-financial corporate debt is twice the size of that of Greece, which is in the emergency ICU.

I would say all the Irish pubs there are packed with German people celebrating how wonderful we are to them, and they will be for quite some time.  To be fair to the Minister of State, she sounds convinced this is the way forward and would be wonderful for our country.  Given that during the general election the Government did not put this to the people and never asked them this big question on our future and our sovereignty, if it is that convinced of it, why does it not put it to the Irish people?  I suggest the Government is not that convinced of it.  If it was, it would go to the people in the morning, but it is not that convinced.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Will the Minister of State explain, given the targets of the EU-IMF programme, which require sucking huge amounts of money out of the economy up to 2015 with a further requirement to go beyond that to meet the targets in this treaty, how we will get growth and where that growth will come from?  Will the Minister of State respond to the downgrading of growth projections for this economy and the European economy?  Does she acknowledge at any level that this has something to do with austerity?  How does continued austerity for at least a decade produce jobs and growth?  It does not compute.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	307	To get to the 3% deficit, we know what is coming down the tracks in terms of reductions and cutbacks of â¬3.8 billion this year and â¬3.2 billion next year.  Surely, before the Taoiseach agreed to this treaty, he had some idea of what figures are involved in getting us to the 0.5% target to which we are told there must be rapid convergence.  Will the Minister of State explain what are the cutbacks or expenditure reductions over the period, and what period of time is involved in regard to the 0.5%?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am trying to square the circle following the Minister of State's reply in regard to Article 3.2.  How can anybody look Chancellor Angela Merkel in the eye, as the Taoiseach did, and sign up to something that has to be of binding force and permanent character, and then say in the House that future Oireachtais can actually repeal and amend it?  There seems to be a disingenuous dimension to this.  The situation is unclear.

I absolutely appreciate there is a concern that debt sustainability was not a featured item on the agenda at the summit on Monday.  However, it has been featured at numerous summits in recent months.  There was a decision by Heads of Government that on this occasion the focus would be on two issues, the first being finalising the text of the fiscal compact.  The Deputy may not agree with it but that is the decision they took.  The other was to focus primarily on the issue of jobs, growth and exploring various ways in which the institutions of the European Union might be used to assist member states in their efforts.  These include, for example, ways in which the European Investment Bank could be leveraged in order to work with member states to develop opportunities in investment and infrastructural projects and so on.  That is something our Government is exploring in some detail.The Commission proposal on project bonds, for example, is a matter the Government is discussing and specific Departments have been charged with investigating and identifying specific opportunities for Ireland.  There are a number of positive outcomes from the summit.  The issue of the sustainability of Ireland's debt, as Members know, is under discussion with-----

In particular, I wish to outline the steps taken by my Department and the HSE to mitigate the impact of budget cuts on front-line service delivery, and to set out my health reform priorities for 2012.There is no doubt that 2012 will be the latest in a series of immensely challenging years for the health service.  The â¬750 million savings target for 2012 follows â¬1.75 billion of savings in the past two years.  Staff numbers will also reduce significantly in the coming months.  These reductions are happening at a time when demand for services is ever-increasing.  Despite these challenges, my commitment to developing a single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need rather than income, remains resolute.  Delivering on this commitment means that reform is no longer just an option but an essential requirement for all involved in health service provision.The HSE service plan which I approved on 30 January sets out the health and personal social services that will be delivered by the HSE within the current budget of â¬13.317 billion.  The plan reflects the programme for Government commitments for health and the savings targets set out in the comprehensive-----

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The plan reflects the commitments for health in the programme for Government and the savings targets set out in the comprehensive expenditure report 2012-2014.  I already acknowledged that the scale of the financial challenge facing the HSE means there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services but this will not be a straight line reduction.  Approval of the plan followed extensive work undertaken by my Department and the HSE, including a rigorous examination of budget allocations across the services aimed at minimising the impact on front-line services and identifying where efficiencies can be driven.It is clear that the targets for service delivery set out in the plan are very demanding and will not be deliverable on a business as usual basis.  The plans commit the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources.  It reflects the need to move to new models of care across all service areas which will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the least possible cost.Reform initiatives set out in the plan include development of proposals to protect the viability of community nursing units and to increase the immediate care capacity for older people.  I will continue to work with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on this issue.There will be a significant strengthening of primary care services including issuing GP visit cards to long-term illness claimants.  Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, I will ensure the delivery of this significant step on the road to universal health insurance, UHI, and free GP care for all.  An additional â¬35 million will be targeted at improving child, adolescent and adult community mental health teams, as well as suicide prevention and counselling services.  There will be a more tailored approach to disability services.  The roll-out of the colorectal screening programme will commence.  Funding for the HPV vaccine programme and an MMR catch-up programme will be prioritised.  I am happy to inform the House that there has been a 80% take-up of the HPV vaccine programme, one of the best recorded.  There will be a progression of the clinical care programmes including the roll-out of a national chronic disease management programme for diabetes.The service plan will be implemented in the context of a further reduction in the number of staff available to provide services.  The Government has determined that in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced to 102,100 whole-time equivalents by the end of 2012.  From September 2011 to the end of February this year, some 3,700 staff members will have retired from the health service.  Approximately 1,500 of these have already retired during the four months to the end of December last while the most recent data indicates that a further 2,200 will depart by the end of February.  I intend to review the plan once the full impact of the staff leaving at the end of the 29 February grace period is known.  As this is a dynamic plan, it will be reviewed regularly.While the numbers leaving are indeed significant and represent a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services, we will still have in excess of 100,000 staff.  We must focus our attention on how to make the most effective use of this most important resource.  The priority must be to reform how health services are delivered to ensure a more productive and cost-effective system.  This requires greater flexibility in work practices and rosters, as well as maximising the use of redeployment so as to facilitate the best possible organisation of services.  The service plan includes a commitment to addressing these issues in the context of the public service agreement which provides the framework for delivering significant change.This agreement, if used to its full potential, can provide the health sector with the tools to transform, modernise and minimise reductions in health services.  It will allow us to reduce staff numbers, to become more efficient and productive, reduce our costs and improve quality.  It is essential we achieve these goals.The service plan represents a key signpost for how our health and social services will be delivered in the coming year.  In addition to the plan, the Government has set out a major agenda of reform of our health care system which will lead to universal health insurance as promised in the programme for Government.Last week, I hosted a national forum attended by key stakeholders from the HSE where I identified four key reform priorities for 2012.  These include delivering on the special delivery unit's agenda; further overhaul of health system governance; changing the model of care, which my ministerial colleague, Deputy Shortall, will further discuss with particular reference to primary care; reforming the health insurance sector including introducing full risk equalisation; and working with the insurance companies to reduce cost.  The special delivery unit, SDU, has already had a significant impact on hospital performance and is improving patient experiences in a tangible way.  Last year, I identified two key priorities for the SDU and I am happy to report it has delivered on both objectives.In the area of unscheduled care delivered in emergency departments, ED, the cumulative number of patients waiting on trolleys at 8.00 a.m. across the country for the first 16 days of January 2012 reduced by 27% when compared with the same period last year.  I directed that all public hospitals ensure they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for scheduled care by the end of 2011.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund reported that at the end of 2011, 41 hospitals, 95% of the total, met the target to eliminate over 12 month waiters from their active list.  The only hospital that did not succeed was University College Hospital Galway.  This compares to 28 hospitals at the end of 2010 that had patients waiting over 12 months for treatment on the active list.The work of the past six months has shown that it is possible to exert control and deliver improvements even during a time of budgetary cuts.  However, the improvements already won have to be secured and improved upon while simultaneously pushing forward with further initiatives.  I recently announced new and ambitious targets for the SDU to deliver by the end of 2012 or earlier.  The first target is that no one should wait longer than nine months for elective treatment, down from last year's target of 12 months.  As would be expected there has been an uptake in waiting lists in the first few weeks of January after the Christmas break.  Measures are being put in place by the SDU to ensure the 12-month limit is maintained and reduced to nine months by 31 December 2012.  The other target is no one should be longer than nine hours in an ED with 95% waiting no longer than six hours.  This will be a real challenge but will be meaningful for the patient.  From the time a patient registers at the front desk to when he or she is discharged from the department or sent on to a ward, no one should be longer than nine hours in an ED with 95% waiting no longer than six hours.  The SDU will also set and implement targets for improved access to outpatient and diagnostic services in the first quarter of 2012.  Work is under way measuring the outpatient waiting list, an exercise never done before.Notwithstanding the gains achieved so far, there is no room for complacency and delivering on these new targets will be extremely challenging.  However, I have witnessed the dedication and skill of health sector employees and their satisfaction when their hard work is translated into a better service for the patient.  As such, I have every confidence they can continue to push forward in the coming year.  I commend them on their work to date.In reforming health system governance, I recently announced my intention to establish seven new directorates - hospitals, primary care, social care, mental health, children, public health and shared services.  Other organisational reform priorities for the year include the relocation of the national clinical care programmes and the national cancer control programme to my Department.  This will help ensure even closer working with the SDU in improving performance across the system.  A new programme management office will be established in the Department to drive the implementation of this wide ranging process of reform.I will provide the House with further details of two important building blocks towards UHI which we are developing immediately.  The first is my decision to organise every acute hospital into a set of hospital groups so they are managed efficiently in well co-ordinated units.  Each group will have a consolidated management team headed by a group chief executive with responsibility for performance and outcomes, operating in clearly defined budgets and employment limits.  This initiative will build on the groups that I have already announced in Galway and Limerick.The second building block is the framework for the development of smaller hospitals which I announced last year and will be published shortly.  The hospital groups and the framework are closely linked.The initiative I am taking to set up hospital groups is an important one.  For too long, some hospitals have tended to see themselves as operating in isolation from one another without much regard to how a co-ordinated effort between hospitals could produce better outcomes for patients.  I am pleased many hospitals are now working much more closely together, recognising they need to pool skills and resources to the benefit of all patients.Having a designated group of hospitals in each area with a group chief executive and consolidated management team will help us ensure a more efficient service which uses our limited resources to best effect.  The group chief executive and management team will work closely to run the group of hospitals efficiently within the requirements of a specified budget and number of staff employed.  This will help hospitals plan their services, and most importantly, it will benefit patients who are offered a more integrated service.  I will make a further announcement regarding the establishment and composition of the hospital groups in the near future.Last year, I announced the Government would publish a framework for the development of smaller hospitals.  I intend to honour that commitment shortly.  The purpose of the framework is to offer clear information about the role of our smaller hospitals in the future.  It will demonstrate in a practical way that smaller hospitals can and will provide more services for more patients in their local community.  Far from being downgraded or closed, smaller hospitals will be developed over time to provide day surgery, ambulatory care, a range of medical services and diagnostic services to their local communities.  I have often made the point that much of this work is already done in larger hospitals even though it could be provided for many people closer to home in their local community.  This transfer of services from larger to smaller hospitals makes sense.  It brings services closer to patients and it frees up the larger hospitals to provide the more complex work that only they can provide.The framework will be an initial blueprint setting out the main type of service change that we see happening over the coming years.  It will not be a master plan drawn up centrally and delivered or imposed locally.  It will form the basis for local consultation based on the principles it sets out.  As we fully recognise that the best solutions will almost certainly vary between regions, there can be no question of a one size fits all approach.Implementation of the framework will focus on nine smaller hospitals, namely, Navan, Dundalk, Loughlinstown, Mallow, Bantry, Ennis, Nenagh, St. John's Limerick and Roscommon.  We have been working on draft plans for the development of each of these hospitals and these plans will form the basis for the consultation process that will take place in each area.My Department is also working on a high level policy framework for health and well-being to cover the period from 2012 to 2020.  The policy framework will be Ireland's vision for a healthier population that is protected from public health threats and lives in a healthier and more sustainable environment with increased social and economic productivity and greater social inclusion.The theme that runs through the entire HSE service plan is reform, innovation and efficiency.  The reforms that I am proposing are different from those tried before in a number of ways.  I intend to oversee a reform programme that is comprehensive rather than incremental, led by innovation as opposed to dictated by resources and, most important, patient focused instead of system focused.Last week the special delivery unit announced improvements in the number of people waiting on trolleys.  Since the middle of December 27% fewer people were on trolleys compared with the same period in the previous year.  Before the SDU became fully operational last September there were on average 50 more people on trolleys every day than during the previous year.  We started last year with the number of people on trolleys at about 30% above the level of the previous year and we are now 30% below the previous year.  That represents a considerable improvement against a backdrop of ever diminishing budgets.  In improving service while reducing budgets, we are doing something that has not been done in any other western health service.The change that I am driving is not for its own sake.  It is a prerequisite to giving people a fairer health system that is more efficient and of higher quality.  The reforms are working and we are now beginning to see real evidence of progress.  The progress that has been made proves it is possible to drive service improvements, even during these times of financial difficulty, through flexibility, innovation and new ways of working.  The improvement is real and measurable, and it is what our citizens deserve.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I welcome the opportunity to speak about the health service plan.  Those who provide health services face challenging times in managing the budgets they are allocated in the context of the budget deficit, addressing Government over-expenditure and providing a clear and sustainable pathway for the future delivery of health services.However, we have concerns about the planned provision of health care because, while the Minister for Health strongly argued that front line services will not be diminished by the impending retirement of a significant number of highly qualified professionals, we believe he will face difficulties after 1 March.  We will lose some of our best emergency department nurses and highly experienced midwives, as well as a spectrum of health professionals.A contingency plan should have been prepared at this stage given that some knowledge should now be available about the anticipated number of retirements from front line emergency services.  I do not expect contingency plans for the entirety of the health services because I accept that elective and other medical treatments are not the immediate priority but surely plans are required in respect of maternity and emergency care.  Such plans would not only allow us to debate future health provision but also put people's minds at ease.Irrespective of whether we disagree with them or, like the Taoiseach, call their remarks outrageous, we cannot ignore the consultants at the coalface of maternity services who have drawn attention to the potential risks resulting from the retirement of experienced staff.  This puts the patients who will be using maternity services in jeopardy and it is unfair to those who are retiring to say they are putting lives at risk.  A plan should be put in place to maintain these key services over the short to medium term while replacement staff are trained.I welcome the Minister's comments on acute services and the clustering of hospitals in the context of reconfiguring services.  Reform must be introduced through consultation and discussion, however.  There was vigorous opposition to the cancer care strategy, although most people will now acknowledge it has improved the outcome for cancer patients and statistics reveal a remarkable improvement in prevention, diagnostics and treatment.  The strategy was implemented in the face of considerable political opposition to reconfiguration of services and clustering hospitals, providing the appropriate support systems, centralising treatment and diagnostics to centres of excellence and outsourcing other elements of cancer care.That was a flagship project but it was irresponsibly opposed by the people now sitting on the Government benches who are advocating the same principle in respect of acute services.  The Minister's record will show that he has had a conversion on the road to Damascus.  I support him in many of his initiatives but I take issue with the idea that what he said previously can be air-brushed from the record so that he can pontificate about making fundamental changes that nobody else attempted.  Many people tried to address these issues but they did not receive the support they required.It is important that we fully engage everybody involved, whether they are providing or receiving care, in regard to the proposed reconfiguration and clustering of services.  We will be watching with interest what happens in Mallow, Bantry, Navan and the other hospitals to which the Minister referred.  They have a significant role to play and their communities must not be led up the garden path in the same way as the people of Roscommon and Cork, in terms of St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  I do not blame local Deputies for leading them up the garden path because the Minister led the Deputies up the path when he clearly stated that services would be retained.  This is a historical matter but when he claims he wants to fundamentally change governance and delivery of health services we must be able to believe what he says.  His actions on becoming Minister for Health were the exact opposite of what he said previously.

These debates merit serious attention because they concern the delivery of fundamental services.  The health service is important not only to those who work in it but also the wider population who trust they will receive care when they need it.I acknowledge there are significant pressures on health budgets but the Minister's proposals for universal health insurance represent a fundamental shift in policy.  I do not expect him to produce a White Paper next week but he should at least provide an outline of what he has asked the implementation group to investigate and report on by the end of this year or the beginning of 2013.  Is it investigating the broad issue of universal health insurance or has he asked it to consider specific issues?  The funding of our health service in the future is a fundamental issue.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Government's overriding fiscal objectives are twofold: first, we must return to a situation in which we are living within our means; and, second, we must put the debt-GDP ratio on a firm downward path.  The strategy to achieve these objectives is set out in the Government's medium-term fiscal statement as well as in the documentation accompanying budget 2012.  These documents spell out the necessary consolidation to correct our excessive deficit by 2015 - in other words to reduce the general Government deficit to below 3% of GDP by that stage.  On the basis of these measures, it is envisaged that the debt-GDP ratio will peak in 2013, and will decline thereafter.This multiannual approach balances the need to support the emerging economic recovery with the need to pursue further consolidation.  Crucially, this strategy has been agreed with the troika.  The intergovernmental treaty on stability, co-ordination and governance in the economic and monetary union agreed on Monday does not change the strategy as implementing the programme commitments remains the priority.Nevertheless, over the medium term, member countries are required to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms, in other words after adjustment for the impact of the economic cycle on the budgetary position.  The timeframe for convergence towards the structural deficit target set in the intergovernmental treaty and our associated country-specific medium-term objective, MTO, is yet to be determined.  At this point in time, it would be speculative to put forward a possible timeline for reaching the structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP and in any event it is currently the priority for Government to bring our actual deficit below 3% of GDP by the end of 2015.  My officials will continue to work with the Commission on all aspects, including measurement of the structural fiscal position.The debt correction requirement in the new treaty, which will apply to Ireland as our general Government debt-GDP ratio is above 60% of GDP, is the same as is already required under the reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact as part of the so-called "six pack" of legislative reforms.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Specifically, we will be required to reduce our debt-GDP ratio annually by at least one 20th of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.  I would point out that a transition period will apply for all countries that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure on the basis of the deficit criterion, including Ireland.In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the ratio of debt-GDP that is important.  In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions over the medium term, we can expect economic growth to do much of the heavy lifting.  Furthermore, I think its also worth pointing out that, irrespective of our international commitments, we need to get the debt-GDP ratio down to more manageable levels because otherwise we will just spend more of our tax revenue on servicing the debt burden, which reduces the amount we can spend on education, health, social welfare and other areas.It is also appropriate for me to highlight developments in recent times in our bond spreads and the NTMA's recent success in switching approximately â¬3.5 billion worth of bonds due to mature in 2014 with bonds maturing in 2015 at a broadly similar annual interest rate.  This will smooth the maturity profile of Irish debt, and is a reflection of the improved market sentiment for Irish Government paper.

In assessing the provisions of the fiscal compact, this is a key question that needs to be answered.  The economic and fiscal outlook document the Minister published along with the budget in December clearly sets out that nominal GDP for Ireland is forecast to be â¬179 billion in 2015.  The Department of Finance estimates that the structural deficit for Ireland at that time will be 3.7% of GDP or â¬6.6 billion in nominal cash terms.  This is based on everything going according to plan between now and 2015 in terms of the growth rates and the fiscal consolidation between now and then.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	371	As the Minister knows, under the treaty we are obliged to reduce the deficit on the structural side to 0.5% of GDP, so under static conditions it must be reduced to approximately â¬900 million, a reduction of â¬5.7 billion.  Of course, conditions will not be static and it will be a combination of growth and the fiscal adjustment.  The key question is as follows.  Over what timeframe will Ireland be expected to deliver on that reduction of the structural deficit from 3.7% in 2015 to 0.5%?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Allowance is being made for countries with excessive deficits, especially countries in programmes, such as Ireland.  The timeline will be a matter for negotiation with the Commission.  Certainly countries with larger deficits will have a longer period of adjustment than countries with balanced budgets at present.

To what extent will the input of the individual member state be taken on board?  By any measure a further adjustment of almost â¬6 billion in nominal terms, although we hope that growth will offset that, is very significant.  It comes on top of â¬8.6 billion between 2013 and 2015.  My question is very reasonable.  In what timeframe will we be expected to deliver?  What can stop the European Commission in 2015 requiring Ireland to knock a further â¬5 billion to â¬6 billion off our deficit to bring it within the 0.5%?

When it states "propose", it will discuss.The Deputy is correct that the concept of a structural deficit is difficult to understand in the first place.  It is extremely difficult to measure, particularly for a country such as Ireland, which has, in effect, a common labour market with the UK.  The Deputy will remember the Warren Buffet quotation that it is only when the tide goes out that one discovers who has been swimming naked.  The Deputy should reflect on that experience of his party's Government.  The Fianna FÃ¡il and the Green Party Government was supposed to be running surpluses for several years but was actually running structural deficits when all the headline figures suggested surpluses.  The tide went out and they were left naked with the waves lapping around their ankles and nowhere to go.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	378	In September 2011 the Government announced the establishment of the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, within the NTMA and the establishment of the strategic investment fund.  NewERA will centralise the management of Government holdings in the commercial semi-State sector - initially the companies within NewERA's remit are ESB, EirGrid, Bord GÃ¡is Ãireann, Bord na Mona and Coillte - from a shareholder perspective.  This role, based on the shareholder executive model already established in a number of developed economies, will involve oversight of activities such as capital expenditure plans, corporate strategy, acquisitions and disposals.  NewERA is already working closely with the relevant Departments and companies in this regard.  The shareholder executive approach is designed to provide the Government with a portfolio view of investment returns from the sector with a means of assessing the likely impact of commercial developments in the sector on long-term Government investment plans.NewERA is also charged with assisting the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in energy, water and next-generation telecommunications with the long-term objective of employment creation and has commenced work with the relevant Departments in these areas.The strategic investment fund will, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, channel commercial investment from the NPRF towards productive investment in the economy.  As well as money from the NPRF, the fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the economy.  It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs.  The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In November 2011, the NPRF announced a commitment of â¬250 million to a new infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to â¬1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.NewERA and the strategic investment fund are important elements in the Government's strategy to promote economic growth and create jobs.The fifth quarterly review mission under our EU IMF programme took place from 10 to 19 January.  All actions were met for the fourth quarter of 2011 in terms of both policy reforms and quantitative targets.  The troika's overall assessment was positive.During the mission, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I both engaged with senior officials from the EU, ECB and IMF - the troika - and separately assured them that the Government will take all the necessary measures to ensure a successful implementation of the programme.  The Government is continuing its commitment to the fiscal targets set out in the EU-IMF programme.In its concluding summary of the mission, the troika team noted that our programme implementation continues to be strong.  The fiscal deficit target was comfortably reached and was well below the target of 10.6% of GDP.  Major progress in strengthening and downsizing the banking system was made in 2011.  Steps to support growth and job creation are being put in place.  However, Ireland continues to face considerable challenges.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	379	In four weeks it will be a year since the people went to the polls to elect a new Government.  Central to many people's thoughts when they went into the polling stations was the need for change and particularly the opportunities for employment.  Figures have been issued this week indicating that more than 439,000 people are out of work.  We all know about people who are leaving our shores because they feel there is no hope for them on this island.  The Minister spoke about NewERA and the potential for investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  When will we see an investment by the State, using the discretionary portfolio that exists within the National Pensions Reserve Fund of â¬5.4 billion, invested into job creation opportunities?  What the Government is giving people in this city and other places is not satisfactory.  People want to know whether there is a chance for investment in job creation and why the Government has not used any moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to date to invest in jobs.  We know the rest of the money totalling almost â¬19 billion or â¬20 billion has been used to bail out and recapitalise banks.  People want to know whether the Government will bring forward real proposals to use the remainder, some â¬5.4 billion, to help to bail out them and to provide employment for the economy and for them.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	380	There has been an extraordinary change since the Government was elected ten months ago.  The Government is working every day bringing forward initiatives to restore health to the economy and this has been recognised at home and abroad.  The live register figures passed through Government yesterday and they were published today.  They are the best set of positive figures since 2010.  I do not suggest they are satisfactory because there are significant levels of unemployment in the country but things are moving in the right direction.Our model is dependent on export-led growth and the projections for exports are up again on the figures published this week.  On the figures for January, consumer sentiment, which affects the domestic economy, is up to 56.6 on the index.  It was 49.2 in December and last January it was at 48.7.  This represents a significant increase in consumer sentiment and the economy is lifting slowly.  We would prefer if more significant progress was being made but the depth of the hole explains the tardiness of progress made.NewERA will invest when it is satisfied it can make profitable investments with taxpayers' money and that there will be a real creation of jobs.  It will not dig holes and fill them in again simply for the sake of activity.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Investment by the National Pensions Reserve Fund must be made in a certain way and EUROSTAT will dictate that.  The Minister says we are moving in the right direction but young people are moving to Dublin airport and from there to Australia and it is not a lifestyle choice.  The set of figures the Minister claims are the best yet represent 439,000 people unemployed.  It is not acceptable.When I met the troika as part of the Sinn FÃ©in delegation, it informed me that at no point during its discussions did any Minister or Irish Government delegation discuss the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in job creation, save for water metering purposes.  It was never on the agenda of the troika.  The Minister has failed to do this.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach stand up in the House and declare that job creation is their No. 1 priority but never has the issue been raised with the troika except for water metering.  In the Minister's view, how much of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the â¬5.4 billion remaining in the discretionary portfolio, will be used for the purposes of job creation?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	382	Deputy Doherty has quoted the troika as stating as much to him previously but when we asked the troika at subsequent meetings it denied that it ever stated this to the Deputy.  Deputy Doherty should sort out that with the troika.I suspect the troika is right because on several occasions we raised with it the possibility not only of using the National Pensions Reserve Fund for job creation, but the possibility of using a proportion of the proceeds when State assets are sold for re-investment in projects that would generate growth and job creation.  I am unsure where Deputy Doherty's quotation is coming from but that is not what the troika has said to us.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	384	There is a good deal of uncertainty at the moment as evidenced by the wide range of GDP projections for this year not only for Ireland, but also for the euro area.  The recent downgrading of forecasts by the IMF, including those for Ireland, reflects heightened concern about growth prospects in the euro area and the wider global outlook.  As a small, open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, Ireland will be affected by weaker euro area growth.  However, the substantial competitiveness improvements we have seen in recent years will provide some support.  It is important to note that a weakening of activity in our main trading partners is already factored into the Department of Finance forecasts for economic growth which underpin the 2012 budget.The budget forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3% in 2012.  This forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information, domestic and international, available up to the end of November 2011 and it was mid-range at that time.  Given the highly uncertain environment, the budget documentation also pointed to several risks to this forecast, some to the downside and some to the upside.  These risks remain valid.While the weak external outlook is of concern, there have also been some positive developments since budget time, not least of which is the trajectory of ECB interest rates which appears more favourable than was the case in November.  In addition, recent exchange rate movements will provide some benefit for the exporting sector.  Some of the economic data, domestically and internationally, have not been as poor as some were assuming.  For example, high frequency survey data shows that economic activity in the euro area increased in January, the first such increase in five months, while at home consumer sentiment picked up, as did new manufacturing export orders.  Moreover, concerted action has been taken at European level to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union.  Measures include the so-called six-pack of legislative reforms as well as the agreement on a fiscal compact to ensure fiscal discipline in participating member states.  I am confident that this strong policy response will contribute to a restoration of confidence in the euro area as we go through 2012.During the coming months my Department will continue to monitor the economic situation in terms of positive and negative developments and, as is the norm, it will publish an updated macro-economic assessment in the spring in the context of the stability programme update.  It is anticipated that the update will be published in April in line with the requirements under the European semester agreed by member states last year.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The Minister's response is made up of "on the one hand this and on the other hand that" and the view that we should wait and see.  I am calling on the Minister to respond to the alarming but accurate concerns expressed by a major international financial body, the IMF.  It is a body that I do not have much time for and whose activities over the years have contributed substantially to the mess we are in now.  However, when the head of the IMF states that we may be headed towards a 1930s-style depression, one must take it reasonably seriously.  I do not understand why there seems to be no acknowledgment that the rather dramatic downgrading of growth forecasts that has occurred in recent months is precisely as a result of austerity and the cuts in expenditure.  It is a consequence of these cuts working their way through in terms of a serious drop in consumer demand and, similarly, a collapse in investment in this country and a drop in investment throughout in Europe.  These two things are absolutely connected.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Will the Minister explain it to me, please, because the economics of his outlook appear to defy gravity?  If we continue to cut as required by the fiscal compact and the austerity programme will it not inevitably produce the same result that we have seen in recent months, that is, growth will continue to contract and we will enter a downward spiral?  How can anything else happen if the Government continues to cut expenditure, if there is no investment and if the banks continue to hoard money in the ECB?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	388	That is an interesting intervention but growth in Ireland has been marked down because of failing growth in our customer countries abroad.  It is not because of anything in the domestic economy.  In fact, the economy in Ireland is positioned to grow and if we got fair weather abroad certainly it would grow strongly.  The economy is growing.  It grew last year by at least 1%.  It continues to grow in the first quarter of this year and as things settle down in Europe I expect there will be stronger growth patterns at the end of the year.The critics make the connection that the budget targets will be off course because of the down-marking of growth rates.  I do not believe this is the case for several reasons.  First, our exports are going rather well.  Second, the thing had improved at the end of the year beyond what we factored into the budget.  The Deputy will remember the budget was worked on a deficit of 10.1% but it will come in for 2011 somewhere between 9.8% or 9.9%.  If one thinks of it as a journey, we are a couple of miles up the road towards our destination.  Therefore, the situation has improved and there is no reason at present to think we will not reach our fiscal target of a deficit of 8.6% at year end.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I am not interested in the fiscal target of 8.6%, I am interested in growth and jobs and that is what my question was about.  The Minister should not deliberately misinterpret my question by referring to the Irish economy.  I referred in particular to Christine Lagarde's comments about the entire eurozone.  Ireland's growth projection is down, as is the case for Europe and Germany.  Who will buy our exports if consumer demand is depressed right across the European economy, even in the large supposedly wealthy states where demand is also contracting?  If people do not have an income because of the austerity already imposed and the further austerity demanded by the fiscal compact and if investment is collapsing because large businesses do not believe it is safe to invest in a depressed economic environment, from where will the jobs and growth come?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	390	Some 20% of our exports go to the United States, another 20% to the United Kingdom, 40% to Europe in general and the other member state and 20% to other markets.  Many of our exports are inelastic to demand, for example medical and pharmaceutical products.  If one is sick and needs a stent for one's heart, one will buy and pay for the stent.  Food is in the same category, particularly food exports into south east Asia and emerging markets.  The new emerging families in China and India want to give their children protein and dairy products and they see Ireland as the premier world brand.  Almost any food that is produced in Ireland can be sold.  Therefore, it is not true to say there is a direct relationship between the downturn in world demand and the ability of Ireland to export.  We proved that all last year, with exports increasing by 4.5% having already increased the previous year by 6%.  We know from the order books that exports will have risen again this year.  Therefore, the Deputy's analysis is not fully correct.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The budget forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3% in 2012.  This forecast was a downward revision from that published in the medium term fiscal statement published at the beginning of November and was necessitated by the deterioration in the external environment that became evident during November.  The budget forecast incorporated all of the information â both domestic and international â that was available up to end-November 2011, and was mid-range at that time.  Given the highly uncertain environment, the budget documentation also outlined a number of risks to this forecast, some to the downside and some to the upside.Clearly, the uncertainty which characterised the second half of last year remains and this is reflected in the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area.  However, there also have been positive developments since budget time, not least of which is the trajectory for ECB interest rates which appears more favourable than when my Department's forecasts were prepared.  In addition, recent exchange rate movements will provide some benefit to the exporting sector.  I also note that some of the economic data â domestically and internationally â has not been as poor as some have assumed.With regard to the fiscal targets, it is important to note that the Exchequer budgetary position at end-2011 was better than anticipated at budget time, thereby providing a small safety margin in terms of achieving the 2012 deficit target.  On a purely model-based approach, a reduction in real GDP by about 1% would, all other things being equal, see the general Government deficit worsen by about a 0.5% point of GDP.  However, it is worth noting that while the troika has revised down its GDP growth forecast for this year to 0.5%, it still sees the overall deficit target of 8.6% as achievable.  In this respect, I would also highlight that it is the nominal growth rate of GDP - that is volume and price changes - which drives tax revenue and affects the various fiscal ratios, as opposed to just real or volume changes.To sum up, the level of uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic forecasts for Ireland and internationally is very high.  However, given that the forecasts were produced in early December and that the fiscal position ended the year marginally better than had been anticipated on budget day, there is no reason to believe our fiscal targets will not be met.  As always, my Department will continue to monitor the economic and budgetary situation over the coming months, in particular the monthly Exchequer situation, and this analysis will inform official thinking on these matters.  As is the norm, my Department will publish a revised set of economic and budgetary forecasts in the April stability programme update.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	392	We can all agree that growth is central to bringing us out of our economic difficulties and that forecasting is an imprecise science.  However, five different bodies have downgraded Irish growth predictions since the beginning of this year.  These range from Davy's saying growth will be 0.4%, Goodbody's 0.7%, ESRI 0.9%, the troika 0.5% and NCB 0.3%.  The Department's current forecast is 1.3%.  The issue is not the achievement of the fiscal target but, to take up the point raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the risk that if the fiscal target looks like it is slipping because of the growth projection, we will be forced to introduce additional fiscal measures during the year.  That is a risk we all want to avoid.I welcome the Minister's comments with regard to our starting position in 2012, which is somewhat better than anticipated.  This gives some welcome headroom on the fiscal side for 2012.  However, the downgrade of the Irish growth forecast by all of the bodies mentioned is a major concern.  The medium forecast is now only 0.5%.  The Minister's medium term fiscal statement points out that if growth is 1% less than anticipated by Government - then 1.6% - the outturn would be a deficit of 9.1%.  Based on the data available to him at this point, is the Minister satisfied we will be in a position to achieve the overall target without additional measures beyond what was announced in the budget in December?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The simple answer is "Yes".  I did not say I anticipated a deficit of 9.1%.  What I said was that if one had a model where one put in a lower growth, one would come out with a projection and one could do the sums that way.  However, there are many other variables, which I pointed out.  Both the troika and the Department of Finance believe that 8.6% is still an achievable target.I agree that matters are very uncertain.  Looking, for example, at the forecasts made by the Department during 2011, one can see that in April we forecasted growth of 2.5%, which was mid-way in the estimates of growth at the time.  In early autumn, we pulled back that forecast to 1.5% or 1.6% and by budget day we pulled it back to 1.3%.  These were all prudent positions given the data available at the time.  I foresee a further pull-back when the forecasts are revisited in April.  However, there are margins and buffers built into the budgetary position which, despite the pull-back in growth figures, will allow us to reach the deficit target of 8.6%.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	394	While we have tended to focus on the picture in 2012 because we can look at that with the highest degree of certainty, the forecasts beyond that, for 2013 of 2.4% and 2014 of 3% and our medium-term outlook are very much dependent on those rates being achieved.  The Minister's medium term fiscal statement lays out clearly that if there is 1%  slippage in that, our debt-to-GDP will peak at 123% and if there is 2% slippage, our debt-to-GDP will reach 133%.  At what point will we begin to look at the potential for change to the growth rates beyond this year?  Will that be reviewed in April with the stability programme update?

Many events are international and are outside our control.  One must remember all the time that the budget is not built on real growth figures, but on growth plus inflation.  The recent figures from the Central Statistics Office make a projection of an increase of 1.8% in the Consumer Price Index for next year.  Therefore, if one adds 1.8%  onto half of the budgetary growth figure of 1.3% we get 2.5%, and the budget is built on 2.5% growth in nominal terms.I take the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Obviously, there will be a reduction in economic activity and that runs counter to growth and job creation.  However, in purely fiscal terms, even with half the growth rate on which the budget is built, taken with the latest figures from the CSO on the Consumer Price Index, we still have a nominal growth rate without taking into account any of the other factors I mentioned.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Over the last number of years, the Irish economy has suffered enormously, and by extension so too have the Irish people.  The bursting of the property bubble has had severe adverse implications for the economy, the public finances and the banking sector, and the fallout has been exacerbated by a global downturn.However, the Deputy should also remember that it was strong export-led growth which provided the basis for the original pick-up in economic activity in the early to mid-1990s.  This is how growth in a small open economy such as Ireland's should be driven, and we are once again seeing evidence of that, with exports growing by over 6% in 2010 and by 4.5 % in the first nine months of 2011. This growth is broadening out into the indigenous export sector, with areas such as agrifood and tourism performing well.  The growth in our exports reflects significant improvements in competitiveness, which are allowing us to trade our way to recovery. Indeed, economic growth has returned, with my Department projecting that last year saw real GDP growth of 1%.  As a result of the export-led recovery, the current account of the balance of payments has also returned to surplus, which shows that Ireland as a whole is once more paying its way.  This is a crucial signal to investors.Evidence of Ireland's enduring attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment was underlined by the IDA's recent announcement that a record number of new investments were won last year.  This will underpin further export growth into the future.While the economy is growing again, it will take time for export growth to feed through to the labour market and the domestic economy.  Moreover, it will take households and firms time to work through the imbalances which had built up during the boom. The Government is acutely aware of the headwinds which the domestic economy faces in this regard.  We have therefore taken a number of steps to support domestic activity and job creation, including the introduction of the jobs initiative shortly after coming into office and the structuring of the 2012 budget in such a way as to be as growth friendly as possible.The jobs initiative is an important part of the Government's overall strategy to establish the correct conditions to allow our domestic economy to recover, while at the same time respecting the requirement to return our public finances to a sustainable position.  It should be viewed as one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity and will be followed up shortly by the action plan on jobs which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will publish shortly.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The establishment of NewERA and the strategic investment fund within the National Treasury Management Agency, which the Government announced last September, is a further major initiative within the domestic economic sphere.  The Government has also taken a number of steps to ensure there is sufficient credit available to business.  I have also sought to support firms and encourage job creation through extending the three-year start-up relief scheme, improving the research and development tax credit scheme and replacing the business expansion scheme with a new employment and investment incentive.While the Government is taking every step to support the recovery of the domestic economy, there is no quick-fix solution.  We must continue to deliver on our commitments under our EU-IMF programme and, in so doing, we will ensure that the programme works for us.  The challenges are substantial and this is why the Government has focused on three main priorities; restoring order to the public finances, repairing the banking system and restructuring the economy towards a sustainable growth model.  We are on track to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015, the banking system has been recapitalised and the economy returned to growth last year following three successive years of annual declines.  In short, the Government is delivering a return to sustainable growth which capitalises upon the underlying strengths of the Irish economy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The Minister must surely agree that the relationship between the export figures and the number of people involved looks unusual.  For example, I believe the top three export companies in Ireland at the moment are Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft and Google.  They export over â¬24 billion in products and services and account for 15% of our exports.  Given that they account for 0.3% of the workforce, that is a bit uneven.  The pharmaceutical industry has exports worth over â¬56 billion, yet employs only 2.6% of the workforce.  It looks from the figures as if each worker is producing â¬1.2 million worth of work each year.  Clearly there are sales funnelled through this country for tax avoidance purposes which are inflating these figures.If the Government is serious about job creation, we need to look more closely at doing something for the domestic economy.  We need to look at the rates structure, which is linked to our poor local government structure, our huge energy costs, upward only rent reviews, which I know are difficult to deal with-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I must call on the Minister to reply.  I will come back to you for another supplementary question.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Incentives for people investing in small businesses would be a help as well.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	400	The best way to project the future is to look at what happened in similar circumstances in the past.  It was export-led growth that brought us a great recovery in the 1990s.  Between 1994 and 2000, nearly 700,000 extra jobs were created.  However, the jobs lagged behind the growth.  I am not sure if the Deputy's statistics are correct, but I accept what he says about different components of the multinational industry base in the country.  Overall, there are over 200,000 people working in these industries and they generate double that number in employment in the ancillary industries that supply them and support them.  That is out of a total number of 1.8 million still at work in this country.  I remember that at the height of the crisis in the late 1980s, employment in the country was down to about 940,000.  Today it is still at 1.8 million.  There are many people still going to work every morning.The level of employment is not acceptable and we must do everything in our power to address the unemployment problem and get people back to work.  However, we are not as badly positioned as the gloom and doom merchants would have us believe, and we can work our way and grow our way out of this.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I assure the Minister that I am not a doom and gloom merchant.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	403	However, indigenous industry would be far more likely to create secondary industry, given that many of our multinationals bring in much of their material from abroad.  There is not quite as much the same spin-off from that.I saw a statement today from Mark Fielding of ISME, who said "How many more people must we lose to emigration and unemployment before we see some action from this ... Government?"  The seasonally adjusted live register figures confirm that almost half a million people are unemployed.  The domestic economy has a huge impact on everybody in the country.  It accounts for 90% of the workforce.  The amount of money that people have in their pockets has such a dramatic effect on small businesses.  They are suffering at the moment and while it is great that the export market is looking good, if the Government can do a bit more for the domestic economy, it will have a much bigger impact on people's lives.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I fully agree with what Deputy Wallace is saying.  Sector after sector in the domestic economy is targeted with initiatives in the budget.  In a couple of weeks we will be able to discuss them when we implement them in the finance Bill.  There are incentives targeted across the board from agribusiness to the food sector to the property business.  We must get the domestic economy going again.  We will not get people going back to work with the numbers we require until the domestic economy is booted up once more.However, we cannot go back to where we were.  Reverting to a property bubble will not solve our problems.  We must go back to the economy we had from the mid to late 1990s, when we were very competitive, when we invested in skills and education and when almost 700,000 extra people went to work over six years.Labour market figures are very interesting.  In 2011, a total of 144,000 people left the live register to go back to work.  It shows the enormous amount of change that took place.  Other people lost their jobs and went onto the live register.  This shows the flux and flexibility of the labour market when 144,000 left the live register and got jobs, yet a whole other tranche of people lost their jobs and went on it.  If we could stop the losses, there are things happening in the economy that are encouraging.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	405	As I have indicated, I am committed to reviewing the approach to the promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State of correcting the banking system.  The troika has agreed to engage in a process with Irish officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows and so on.  Any solution must be consistent with the orderly resolution of IBRC that is already under way.  In tandem with this technical review, I recently met with Commissioner Rehn and the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, to progress the matter.  Additional detail on such proposals will be available when the ongoing work is further advanced.Given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU, I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The purpose of the question is to establish the Government's objective in seeking to revisit the issue of bank recapitalisation costs.  It is clear from the reply that the focus is on the â¬30.6 billion promissory note structure for the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  As many commentators have pointed out and the Minister will, I am sure, agree, the core issue is not the coupon rate that is being paid.  I am seeking to establish what objective the Government seeks to achieve through the technical papers, apart from the general aim of trying to ease the burden on the taxpayer, with which we all agree.  Is the Government seeking a write-off or write-down of the capital amounts owing?  Is it proposing a repayment holiday until the economy is in a much stronger position or a refinancing of the â¬30 billion sum over a much longer period at a cheap interest rate?  Has it identified its preferred options?  While I accept the Minister will not provide a great deal of detail, will he indicate what is the core Government objective apart from easing the burden on taxpayers?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The core Government objective is to enhance Ireland's capacity to repay its debts in order that we can get back into the markets when the programme is drawing to a close and fund at reasonable amounts.  We wish to become a normal eurozone country, that is, one which is no longer involved with the programme.  The primary objective is to enhance our capacity to repay.  If anybody has a good suggestion on how we can achieve this objective, I will examine it.  My suggestion to the European authorities for several months has been as follows.  If the most expensive element facing us, namely, the arrangement by way of promissory note for the funding of Anglo Irish Bank, as it was known, were replaced by an alternative financial instrument of lower coupon and longer duration, the benefit arising would be that the markets, when they look at Ireland, would conclude that this particular obstacle has been relieved and the country's capacity to repay has been increased significantly.  Given our capacity to repay, they would then decide they could lend to us again at low interest rates.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	408	If I interpret the Minister's response correctly, the objective is to identify another financial instrument through which we can refinance the sum involved and repay it over a longer period at a cheap interest rate.  This appears to be the essence of his reply.  I assume, therefore, that the mandate given to the officials who are engaging with the troika is not to seek a write-down of the amount involved or defer the repayment until the economy is in a better position but to restructure it in the manner the Minister outlined.  Is that the essence of the Government's position?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	409	What I laid out for the Deputy was the negotiating position put forward by me initially and which has become the Government's position.  The mandate to the representatives of the troika who are engaged in producing a common policy paper is to find ways and means, whatever they are, to enhance Ireland's capacity to repay debt and enhance our position as I have outlined.  However, certain things have been ruled out.  It is clear from the October summit that private sector involvement, PSI, will only apply to Greece.  This was written into the agreement of the 27 member states at the October summit.  Nothing of that nature will be involved.  We are not talking about resiling in any way from our obligations.The Deputy will appreciate that the arrangement entered into by the Fianna FÃ¡il-Green Party Government for funding Anglo Irish Bank was an extraordinarily extravagant piece of financial engineering.  In addition, taking an interest rate holiday has brought about a position in which the coupon is approximately 8.5% and stretches on for a long time.  These decisions predated the bailout and were taken in the autumn of 2008 and early months of 2009 when the bailout programme was not in place.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	410	As the coupon is going into a State bank, it is not the primary issue.

However, we are stuck with it and must negotiate our way out of it.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The Minister asked for proposals.  He will be aware that on 1 or 2 September I put a proposal to him on what should be done.  As I knew he would not act on it, I subsequently put another proposal to refinance and deal with the capital costs through an extend and pretend arrangement.  I accept the Minister is arguing the case for a version of this proposal.  I will repeat a question I put to him during questions several months ago.  Does he acknowledge that the interest rate is not the issue in respect of the coupon rate because the payments will stay in the State bank and be returned to the State when the bank is wound up?  The real interest cost, which the Minister continues to deny, is the cost of borrowing â¬3.1 billion on 31 March each year and transferring it to Anglo Irish Bank.  Given the Minister's statement that a resolution of this issue is unlikely to be found in the immediate future, should the State pay into Anglo Irish Bank the â¬3.1 billion that is due on 31 March or should the payment be suspended pending the outcome of the current discussions?  Will the Minister publish the terms of reference of the troika technical group in respect of its deliberations?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Notwithstanding our significant differences on what should be done about paying off banks such as Anglo Irish Bank, bondholders and so forth, does the Minister agree that, in the context of seeking any relief on the debt burden, the Taoiseach's comments in Davos were stupid and reckless and undermined any moral credibility we have in seeking debt relief as he essentially stated we deserve what we are getting because people went mad borrowing?

If I told Deputy Boyd Barrett that the people of DÃºn Laoghaire believe he is the best public representative in the greater Dublin area, it would not mean every one of them stated that view.  The Taoiseach's reference to "the people" is a manner of speaking.  He did not mean that everybody in Ireland was to blame for what happened.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Government established the Commission on Credit Unions to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for the sector.  The commission is to take into account credit unions' not-for-profit mandate, volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.  The Commission on Credit Unions submitted its interim report to me on schedule at the end of September 2011 and it was published shortly thereafter.  The interim report deals with phase one of the commission's work regarding the strengthening of the regulatory framework for credit unions, including more effective governance and regulatory requirements.In summary, the interim report's recommendations are: the establishment of a credit union stabilisation mechanism; the introduction of a prudential rulebook for credit unions setting out a comprehensive framework of regulatory requirements; changes to credit union requirements on governance, competency, risk management, internal audit, lending, compliance, liquidity and other matters; the commencement of Part III of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 for credit unions, which will provide the Central Bank with the powers to set out regulations and a code of fitness and probity for the credit union sector; the commencement of credit union contributions under the deposit guarantee scheme; enhanced Central Bank powers to inspect, investigate and gather information from credit unions; the extension of the Central Bank's administrative sanction regime to credit unions; and the application of the provisions of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to credit unions.The interim report was well received by stakeholders and wider commentators.  I have accepted the interim report recommendations and have asked my Department to prepare legislative proposals for inclusion in the credit union Bill to be published by the end of June under the EU-IMF programme.  These proposals are to be discussed with the Commission on Credit Unions before being submitted to Government for approval.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.There are a number of recommendations which will be given effect in the meantime.My Department is currently making the necessary arrangements to commence credit union contributions under the deposit guarantee scheme and will be discussing implementation issues and timelines with credit union stakeholders over the next few weeks.In accordance with the commission's recommendations, I expect to be in a position to commence Part III of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 shortly, which would apply the Central Bank's fitness and probity regime to credit unions.  Once commenced the Central Bank will then have to formulate and consult on draft regulations and a draft code before the fitness and probity regime can come into full effect for credit unions.The commission recommended that the resolution powers granted to the Central Bank under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 should be considered for those credit unions that meet the intervention conditions set out in the Act.  The Central Bank recently undertook the first such action through the appointment of a special manager to Newbridge Credit Union.The final report of the Commission on Credit Unions is due to be submitted to me by the end of March and I expect that it will deal with the remaining issues in the commission's terms of reference, including restructuring.  I do not propose to bring forward proposals on these issues until I have had the benefit of considering the commission's recommendations.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I thank the Minister for his response.  The interim commission report was a good day's work.  There are a lot of sensible recommendations in it, many of which can be acted on in the short term.  I understand the final report is due in March and that the Minister will come forward with the promised legislation to deal with the credit union sector.  We need to give as much certainty as possible to those involved in the credit union sector that it has a strong role in the provision of financial services in this country going forward.I have some concerns about the cost implications of some of the recommendations such as that each credit union would have an internal audit function, risk and compliance officers and so forth.  Allied to that, when does the Minister expect to activate the resolution fund in terms of contributions going into it from credit unions and other regulated entities?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	425	We are pursuing the commencement of the resolution fund at present.  Discussions are going on between ourselves, the Central Bank and the credit union movement but a number of the recommendations of the interim report have already been implemented.  I expect to be in a position shortly to commence Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which would apply the Central Bank fitness and probity regime to credit unions.  Once commenced, the Central Bank will then have to formulate and consult on draft regulations and a draft code before the fitness and probity regime can come into full effect for credit unions.The commission also recommended that the resolution powers granted to the Central Bank under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 should be considered for those credit unions that meet the intervention conditions set out in the Act.  The Central Bank recently undertook the first such action through the appointment of a special manager to the Newbridge Credit Union.We will await the result of the commission's proposal.  That will give us little enough time to formulate the Bill by June but in parallel with the final stages of the commission's consideration, we will run heads of the Bill by it for its views so that we are in a position to legislate as soon as its final report comes in.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Some months ago in the Seanad the Minister estimated that the overall bill for supporting credit unions could be somewhere between â¬0.5 billion and â¬1 billion.  As I understand it, he has provided â¬0.25 billion this year and will provide a further â¬0.25 billion next year.  Is that still a valid estimate following the stress tests which have now been completed?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I was asked a direct question in the Seanad and at the time, there were a lot of rumours going around about credit unions, which were exaggerated.  They were applying the conditions that apply to a small minority of credit unions to the generality and I wanted to allay fears by saying that the Central Bank and the Government stood ready to support credit unions, their depositors and their borrowers.  That position stands and that is what happened in Newbridge.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Is the estimate still broadly-----
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I rely on the Central Bank and the registrar of credit unions.  Effectively, what I was saying was that we will support the credit union movement and will ensure it remains solid.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I welcome the Minister's comments again today that the problem relates to a small number of credit unions.  There was quite a bit of concern about, and criticism of, the Minister's handling of the intervention by the registrar of credit unions to appoint a special manager to Newbridge Credit Union.  Thankfully, maybe because of the day that was in it, other news stories and the media acting responsibly on this issue, there was not widescale fear in regard to credit unions when this hit the news headlines.  What was lacking was reinforcement of what the Minister echoed today that this was an exceptional matter and that the overwhelming majority of credit unions are on a sound financial footing.Will the Minister reassure us and, indeed, the credit union movement that any future interventions by the registrar will be part of a wider reconstruction plan of the credit union movement?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The decision to intervene in Newbridge and to put in a special manager was a decision under law by the Central Bank.  It was not my decision.  Under the same legislation, the Central Bank had to consult me before it moved in.  It had that consultation and deemed it necessary to intervene and then it did so.  The function of the manager is to run the credit union in Newbridge on an ongoing basis and to come back with a report which will, effectively, be a business plan for the future running of the Newbridge Credit Union.  While there was some nervousness over the first 24 or 48 hour period, it settled down and it is trading away.  The manager went in on a Friday afternoon, the credit union opened on the Saturday morning and normal business was conducted and continues to go forward.I draw the Deputy's attention to the interim report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  It sets out data on credit unions over the years 2006-11.  It states that 56 credit unions are under-capitalised with 27 of those considered to be significantly under-capitalised.  That is out of a total of approximately 430 to 450 credit unions.  We would want to get these things in proportion.  We are really talking about 27 credit unions, some big but of a lot them small, which are seriously under-capitalised.  Another 29 are under-capitalised.  That is the quantum.  That is the area of difficulty.  I can tell the Deputy again that the Central Bank and the Government stand ready to support the credit union movement.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.I have stated clearly in the past my view that any tax on financial transactions would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  If such a tax cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on an EU-wide basis, as this would prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.Our major concern is that if a financial transaction tax is introduced, it could affect the financial services industry, especially in the IFSC, and lead to some activities moving abroad.  If, as some countries have proposed, the tax was to be brought in under enhanced co-operation arrangements, we would fear we could lose business to London, since the UK is strongly opposed to this initiative.  In the past, certain financial activities moved to London when other countries enacted similar taxes.The Commission is proposing that the financial transaction tax should be an "own resource" tax imposed centrally to fund the European Union and will be developing proposals in the context of the future of the EU budgets.The current draft proposal is still being discussed at EU Council working party level and will be considered again by the Council of Ministers later this year.  I have made clear our views, as has the Taoiseach, in discussion with our European colleagues.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome the substance of what he said.  He clearly pointed out the implications for Ireland of such a tax being introduced and being effective here but not applying to our nearest neighbour, the UK.  That is something which would be of great concern.I trust the Minister and his colleagues are using their influence in Europe to ensure the eventual outcome of this will be to our satisfaction.  When the delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform was in Germany last week, it was a recurring theme and many of the parliamentarians we met there were clearly very enthusiastic about the idea of a financial transaction tax.  We know that France is going ahead unilaterally to implement one this year.Will the Minister stick to his guns on the issue and ensure that whatever the outcome is at European level, it is favourable to Ireland and that we are not exposed to a situation where our nearest neighbour, an English speaking country with a very large financial centre, can pick up lost business which we will endure as a result of any decision at European level?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Yes, I will bear the Deputy's advice in mind.  I think we are ad idem on this.  It is also worth noting that there are various kinds of financial transaction taxes.  The one that France says it will introduce in the summer is close to the stamp duty we already apply to share transactions.  However, the one in the Commission paper is far more wide-reaching and, in my view, would be injurious to Ireland.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Minister said that if the Commission's proposals were to take place we would see a leakage of jobs and revenue from the State, presumably to London.  Has the Department of Finance carried out any research on what the impact would be if Ireland signed up to a financial transaction tax, while Britain remained outside?  What would be the impact on jobs, revenue, GDP, and the financial services sector which makes up 3% of our GDP?  If that research exists, can the Minister provide the information to the House?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Our information on the proposal is not precise enough to make those kind of fine calculations.  It is true to say, however, that in general terms it would be injurious to Ireland, as there are 30,000 people employed in the financial services area here.  It is hard to estimate because it depends on what activities the tax might apply to.  In Ireland, at present, it is back-shop employment servicing the financial services industry, and there would not be a tax applying to those activities.  We need to watch what transactions a proposed tax would apply to.  Would it hurt existing employment, or would it stop the financial services industry in Ireland from upskilling to get into other more lucrative activities where higher skills and wages would ensue?  Those are the present and future issues, so we are developing an information base for the discussions that will arise in Europe later this year.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Like Deputy Doherty, I think it would be quite important to get some facts and debate this matter more fully.  However, I want to give the Minister the opposite advice to that of Deputy Michael McGrath for him to consider, which is precisely the argument that was put in the German Bundestag by the German finance committee members.  They made the point that the one lesson we must learn from this crisis is the need to rein in the financial markets.  The financial transaction tax is precisely a means of doing that.  They argued that states which opt out on the basis of short-term advantage will suffer in the medium to long term because they will be more vulnerable to shocks in the currently extremely volatile - bordering on anarchic - international financial services sector.  That is an important point for us to consider.  If we all wait for someone else to jump, it will never happen and no action will ever be taken to have some level of regulation for states to clawback from the financial markets.  We need an informed debate but, to be honest, my prejudice would be that we should join in with those who are trying to take action to regulate the financial services sector.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	438	In principle, the Irish Government's position is that if this could be introduced through the influence of the G20 on a worldwide basis, that would be acceptable.  It is not the principle of the tax we object to, but its uneven operation through which we would end up having a tax in Dublin but not in London.  Employment activity and jobs would move from Dublin to London, so our objections are more pragmatic than principled.  After what happened in recent years, there is a strong case to be made for some imposition to be placed on the financial and banking industry so that it would make a contribution to the resolution of what happened.  It is the unevenness of the application, however, which will cost us jobs.  I am in the business of creating and defending Irish jobs, so I am not going to write off jobs in the Dublin financial services centre - where there are good jobs and high employment - because they might move to London due to the implementation of a particular tax.Our position is that worldwide it is a reasonably good idea and we can go with that.  We can also live with the idea of 27 EU member states having a financial transaction tax.  However, we cannot live with 17 states imposing it and Ireland having to apply it, so that there would be a tax in Dublin but no similar tax in London.  That is our position.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will amend the Betting Act 1931 to, inter alia, establish the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, including measures to enforce the regulatory framework.  The drafting of the Bill, which is fairly complex, is well advanced.The Finance Act 2011 contained measures to allow for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and for a 15% gross profit tax to betting exchanges.  The taxation provisions are subject to a ministerial commencement order which can only be commenced when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.As the Deputy may be aware, it is currently the bookmaker who is liable to pay the betting duty.  When the betting duty is extended to the remote betting sector, liability will remain with the bookmaker.  To do otherwise would provide an incentive for the punter to seek out ways to avoid paying the tax.  From an enforcement point of view it is a far easier task to police a relatively small number of firms compared with hundreds of thousands of consumers.  It is not possible to cost the levy as proposed by the Deputy, as neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners has access to the relevant data, that is, the level and breakdown of winning bets.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I thank the Minister for his response.  The question I tabled refers specifically to substantial winnings of over â¬500,000.  Whereas it is never popular to propose levies or other revenue-raising measures for the State, there is now a responsibility on all of us in this House to bring forward such proposals, as long as they are not deflationary and have no negative social impact.  I have suggested that we could consider applying a progressive tax on lottery winnings over â¬500,000.  I wish to cite a couple of examples.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Does the Deputy have a question?
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Yes.  Will the Minister consider the following example?  If someone is lucky enough to win â¬8 million in the lotto, which is quite a frequent occurrence here, a 10% tax on the amount over â¬500,000 up to â¬4 million would yield â¬350,000 for the State.  A 20% levy on winnings over â¬4 million would yield a further â¬800,000, which would be â¬1.15 million for the State.  The jackpot winner would still go away with â¬6.85 million, which I am sure he or she would be very happy with.  Considering that there are 260 national lottery draws every year, with prizes exceeding â¬500,000, there is considerable potential for the State to generate revenue.  It may be something that could be specifically examined.  I am sure the national lottery would not be overly happy with this proposal, but it is a win-win situation.  The State would win, while the jackpot winner would not complain too much.Another example is that of Dolores McNamara who won over â¬115 million.  Under my proposal the State could be in for a windfall in such a scenario of approximately â¬20 million.  The EuroMillions winner, meanwhile, would still be up by â¬96.5 million.  It is a proposal that warrants consideration.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I have no plans at present to look at these measures.  The lottery has been a very successful operation since Deputy Michael Creed's father, Donal Creed, first introduced it.  It has funded many sporting activities in the country and is now funding educational activities and health services, where it replaces Exchequer funding.  When one has a successful model going, I think one should let it operate.  That is my position, although I am glad of any suggestions-----

I can see the great work it has done over the years both in my constituency and elsewhere throughout the country, through the revenue it has raised.  At the same time, however, I think my practical suggestion could be examined.  Further down the list of questions, there is a proposal on SMS and MMS text levying which, based on current usage patterns, could generate up to â¬244 million, if implemented.  The Minister could consider that positive step and it would not have a major deflationary impact on the economy or a negative social impact.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I have heard the argument about a tax on text messages.  During the week, I met a woman who told me that when she calls her daughter for her tea in the evening, she gets a text message from the bedroom and must text her daughter back.  I remind the Deputy that there is already VAT on text messages at 23%.

The national lottery uses the phrase, "It could be you" but it would be the Minister for Finance every Wednesday, Saturday and Monday.  That would not go down well with the public.  We can tax online gambling, which is not labour-intensive, and there is a need to consider the levies that could be placed on online gambling.  Sinn FÃ©in proposed 5% and it would bring in â¬100 million.  The Minister should consider this.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Arrangements were made by my predecessor in last year's Finance Bill in association with the 2011 budget but they can only be enacted by ministerial order when the base legislation has been produced.  The arrangements are in place and the legislation is being prepared.  I referred to it in this year's Budget Statement as an additional amount of money, but not a lot, because I am not sure how much will be collected or to what degree the collection system will be efficient.  I am told it can be done and we will see where we are then.  We can have a debate on it when I bring legislation to the House, which I hope to do before the summer.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	452	As I indicated in my reply to this question from the Deputy on Tuesday, 15 November 2011, my understanding is that the Deputy is referring to trading in futures in foodstuffs, such as wheat, on stock markets and the need to have a regulatory framework in place to deal with these trades.  A regulatory regime for these types of trades was set down in the 2004 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007, SI 60 of 2007.Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the statutory instrument provides a list of the financial instruments within the scope of the regulations.  Paragraph 8 of that part refers to "options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and any other derivative contracts" and sets down specific circumstances where these apply.  Similar provisions should be in place in all member states.  The scope of this paragraph is wide-ranging and includes derivative contracts in commodities such as foodstuffs.  Although rules are in place for this type of trading in Ireland, in practice there is little prospect of them being implemented because currently there are no commodities exchanges established in Ireland, either as part of the Irish Stock Exchange or elsewhere.In order to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, and in line with G20 commitments, a proposal to extend the scope of market abuse regulation, so that it includes derivatives trading, has recently been adopted by the Commission and is being negotiated at Council working group level.  A revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, with a view to improving transparency and accountability in securities trading, is also being negotiated at Council working group level.A Commission proposal for a regulation, which is now nearing agreement, addresses trades in derivatives that are conducted away from exchanges, in other words, over the counter.  The outcome of this negotiation will include reporting and clearing obligations for these trades, leading to more transparency and control over derivatives, including food derivatives.  When finalised, these EU legislative initiatives will come into force in all member states.  The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this country for the purposes of derivatives legislation.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I wish to focus on the role of the Minister for Finance as a member of ECOFIN.  The EU market and financial instruments directive is currently being discussed.  There is a strong lobby for light touch regulation in this area and the Minister knows where light touch regulation has got us in this country.  Is the Minister satisfied with the level of regulation in the sector?  Is he aware that speculators have increased their role in trades in the food market by 500% over the past 15 years?  Spectators are taking money out of the pockets of Irish farmers, leading to food shortages in developing countries, and costing Irish families an additional â¬300 a year in food bills.  As a member of the ECOFIN, will the Minister push for position limits to be put in place as part of the review of the directive, rather than position management, which is the light touch regulation that lobbyists seek?  This will lead to food security being jeopardised, not just for Irish farmers and in Europe, but throughout the world.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The Deputy knows more about this area than I do because he has taken a special interest in it.  As part of the post-crisis reform agenda, the European Commission has made several proposals affecting investment, particularly derivatives.  I can provide the Deputy with a briefing note on that point.  I was not aware of the extent of the concern in the farming community and the growth in trading derivatives.  A family in a poor community in a developing country needs food but to an investor in the Chicago commodities exchange, food is just another commodity on which one makes money.  The balance has been struck and I am satisfied there is a satisfactory process under way in Europe to provide strong regulation.  I will input what the Deputy said to the working group discussions so that the result will be strong regulation rather than light touch regulation.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I welcome the opportunity to raise the important need for the Minister for Social Protection to address urgently the problems being encountered by parents of autistic children seeking to receive or retain the domiciliary care allowance.  I thank the Minister for her presence in the Chamber.  According to the Department of Social Protection document, Medical Eligibility Guidelines for Domiciliary Care Allowance, domiciliary care allowance is a payment made in respect of the extra care, attention and supervision needs of the child.  It is a monthly payment of â¬309.50, paid until the age of 16 and is also linked to eligibility for respite care grants and carer's allowance.  I know many families living with conditions on the autistic spectrum, as do all Members.  These children require extra care, extra supervision, extra attention and, in many cases, dominate a family's life.Conditions on the autistic spectrum manifest themselves in many ways.  To the outside world, a child might seem almost typical but behind closed doors a family could be experiencing severe challenges in meeting the care needs of their son or daughter.  When it comes to autism and assessing need, nothing is black or white.  It varies from child to child, from family to family.  Domiciliary care allowance does not remove the challenges and it does not provide a cure because there is no cure.  However, it provides some recognition, some help and some acknowledgement that the parents of a child with autism spectrum disorders, ASD, are meeting those extra care needs.  It is a small help in what can be a difficult family life.It now seems that parents of children with autism are meeting more and more obstacles in their efforts to receive domiciliary care allowance or, for those already in receipt, to retain it.  I will give an example in the words of a parent:I was one of the first to be hit with the refusal letter after Christmas having been in receipt of DCA for a little over 2 years.  Apparently the reason they gave for refusing to continue payment was, "your child doesn't require any more care than a child of the same age who doesn't have a diagnosis".That is earth shattering and insulting to the family of a child with a special needs diagnosis.  That child was diagnosed two and a half years ago with ASD.The child has toileting and feeding issues and can be prone to meltdowns.  They have a full-time SNA in school, yet the Department had the audacity to say that the child does not have additional care needs.I do not expect the Minister for Social Protection or any other Minister to respond to individual cases in a debate - I would not raise any individual case - but I want to assure her that the comments of this parent are replicated by dozens of others who have contacted my office.  Fear of the postman delivering a brown envelope with the State harp through the door, informing families with autism that their child does not have extra care needs, is a real worry for many.  I implore the Minister to take the opportunity of this debate to talk with her officials in her Department and revert with an update on the issue.  Why are so many children with autism being subjected to reviews all of a sudden when their needs have not changed?  Why are so many families of children with autism being refused payments they and their doctors know they need - they supply medical evidence in support of them.I will conclude with a comment from another parent: "I am at my wits end trying to put together enough paperwork to prove what is clearly obvious to anyone who spends time with my children.  I cannot tell you how soul destroying this process is."  The parents of children with autism have to constantly fight a bureaucratic war with paperwork to prove a need they and their doctors know exist and they do not have time to be fighting.  I would be grateful to hear anything the Minister can do to help address the situation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living, and she or he must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  Responsibility for the administration of new claims to the allowance transferred to the Department from 1 April 2009, with the existing customer base transferring on 1 September 2009.The allowance is currently paid to over 24,000 parents or guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately â¬100 million in 2011, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further â¬45 million, a total of â¬145 million.  The respite care grant is an annual payment of â¬1,700 automatically paid to DCA parents in respect of each qualified child, provided it is in payment at the beginning of June in the particular year.The application process for the allowance is exactly the same for children with autism as for those with any other disability and involves the completion of a claim form which includes details of the medical condition of the child and the level of care and attention the child needs to deal with normal day to day activity.  This information can be provided by the parent or guardian of the child, the child's general practitioner and any other professionals who have dealt with the child.  There is a section on the application form which allows for the detail of referrals to any of nine professional services to be listed and reports relating to these referrals can be included with the application.Applicants are also free to submit any other information they feel will inform the Department's deciding officer in making his or her decision.  All the information submitted is assessed by designated departmental medical assessors.  Decisions are made by doctors, not departmental administrative officials.  Medical assessors are qualified and experienced people who meet regularly to ensure best practice and consistency of approach.  As the medical diagnosis is not in dispute, it is considered that the medical assessor is in a position to perform the role of assessing the additional care required for the child by way of desk assessment using the detailed information supplied.Based on the information available, the Department's medical assessors give their opinion to the deciding officer as to whether the child's disability is such, as Deputy Harris said, that it requires him or her to need continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of that required by a child of the same age.  They also advise as to whether the disability is likely to last for at least 12 consecutive months.The range of disabilities that could qualify a child for the allowance is not prescriptive and, as such, each case is decided on its merits, taking account of all the available information.  The current application form allows for the applicant to submit as much information as he or she may wish and from as diverse a group of professionals as possible.  This ensures that the medical assessor has all the relevant information available before giving his or her professional opinion in each case.The decision as to whether a child satisfies the qualifying conditions for DCA is made by the deciding officer, having considered all the circumstances including the opinion of the Department's medical assessor.  In this context, the Deputy should note that the percentage of children on the autism spectrum that are refused DCA is in line with the overall refusal rate.  DCA cases are reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how his or her condition may or may not improve over time.Parents and guardians are involved in the review process as reviews are initiated with the completion a review of medical criteria form by the parent, which also requires medical input from the child's doctor.  The parent returns this form, together with any additional recent reports of medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  This information is then sent for review by one of the Department's medical assessors who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child still meets the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.  DCA remains in payment during the review process until a revised decision is made.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply which sets out the technical nature of the DCA scheme.  From dealing with the issue in my clinic and my involvement with autism charities - many Members of the House will concur - it is not being matched with the reality.In an effort to be constructive I will highlight some issues.  One is the 21 day period of appeal that families are given.  In many cases families cannot access the support services they need to back up their appeals within 21 days.  Families depending on access through the public service wait for a longer period of time.  As I am sure do many other Members, I meet people who come to my clinic in a panic to return the form within 21 days but have not seen medical experts within that period to back up their complaints.The Minister referred quite correctly to the disabilities the Department's medical experts examine and whether a disability will last longer than 12 months.  In the case of a condition like autism, it is lifelong and there is no cure.  Some of the reviews I have come across happen at the most bizarre times, such as when an autistic child turns 13 years of age, moves to secondary school or commences puberty.  They are very sensitive stages in the life of a child with a disability and a family living with an autistic child.  Such reviews can be insensitive.The problem I and the families I talk to see is that autism is not, strictly speaking, a medical condition.  It is a neurodevelopmental  condition.  It is not the same as being in a wheelchair, with the many challenges that poses.  It is different and varies from child to child.Representatives of autism support groups have met with Department officials and have expressed concern about the DCA operational guidelines for deciding officers.  I understand the officials acknowledged there may be an issue and it might be an area the Minister can examine.  The Minister might also provide us with up-to-date data on the period of time it takes to assess an appeal, particularly if it has been refused.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I want to discuss what is happening in terms of numbers.  Some 55% of the claims for children with autism-related conditions were allowed from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011.  These statistics are based on a total of 920 DCA applications processed during that period, with a stated medical condition within the autism spectrum.  Of these, 507 were deemed to satisfy the qualifying criteria, and 413, or 45%, were deemed ineligible.  Approximately 46% of all claimants are awarded the allowance.  The success rate does not vary significantly between claims relating to an intellectual disability and those relating to a physical disability.  This must be emphasised in the context of the Deputy's concern that children with an autism spectrum problem may be dealt with differently from other children whose parents submit claims.The Department took over the scheme in 2009, before which the eligibility criteria were set out in a circular from the Department of Health and Children.  The medical criteria, as set out in the circular, referred to children with a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  The medical criteria in the Social Welfare Act are almost exactly the same.  There were no agreed national guidelines for the scheme when it was under the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  An expert medical group was established when the scheme was being transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The primary purpose was to set out consistent and objective guidelines for use nationally in determining the eligibility of children for the scheme.  The assessment structure developed from the recommendations of that group.If at the time of a child's assessment there is a recommendation to award an domiciliary care allowance, a review date is often indicated by the medical examiner.  I presume the review's appropriateness is based on his or her medical expertise related to the condition the child presents with.  The structure is in place.  While I appreciate what the Deputy is saying about families being concerned, we are not treating children with an autism spectrum disability differently from others.  The circumstances of children who qualify at a certain age for the allowance may improve or change.  The expert medical group gave advice on the structure.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this topic because although we are creating work, we are not necessarily creating jobs.  I will elaborate on that.The Road Safety Marking Contractors Association, RSMCA, was established within the Construction Industry Federation in 1998.  It comprises the leading road marking contractors in Ireland.  They provide direct employment to an estimated 400 people.  The association's members are typically family-owned companies carrying out their work as main contractors for all the local authorities and the National Roads Authority and as subcontractors to civil engineering and road-surfacing contractors.  These companies make a valuable contribution to the safety of roads in some very hazardous environments and the quality of their work is only to be commended.  This work is paramount on many fronts and it is contributing to the decrease in the number of deaths on the roads.During recent years, the association has noted a marked increase in the number of non-resident contractors being awarded work by local authorities for both road marking and road surfacing and a lack of effort by all public procurement bodies to ensure that all contractors or subcontractors, irrespective of where they are based, are fully compliant in respect of working in the Republic.I am concerned about non-compliant contractors tendering and carrying out work on behalf of local authorities.  They are competing with Irish-owned companies but have a lower cost base than those companies.  Under the public procurement procedures of the Department of Finance, all contractors, including subcontractors, carrying out work on behalf of all local authorities must comply with the registered employment agreements.  This ensures there is a level playing field for all competing tenderers in public procurement in regard to rates of pay and compliance with construction workers' pension schemes and revenue regulations.  Employers are contributing â¬28 per week for each employee to the CWPS, while employees are contributing â¬24.50 per week.  Foreign-owned companies have a distinct advantage as they may not be obliged to meet such pension requirements.Failure to comply with the requirements is an offence under section 32 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  Therefore, there is an obligation on all procurement authorities to ensure there is in place a robust and transparent administrative procedure when awarding contracts.  The policing of these procedures falls upon the NERA, the CIMA and the local authorities but this is either not being done or being done through self-certification.  Self-certification means a company signs a document stating it is compliant but it does not have too furnish any proof of this.  It is the burden of proof that ensures non-compliant contractors must comply with relevant legislation.  In certain instances, the local authority checks only that the main contractor is compliant and dismisses any requirement to check that all subcontractors on site are compliant.  Compliance with the arrangements imposes a considerable cost on companies tendering for public procurement contracts, and the lack of enforcement of the legislation gives an unfair advantage to non-complying contractors coming in from abroad.The association met Mr. Deering of the NERA last year to discuss this issue.  The NERA has no powers to act against out-of-State contractors.  This means non-compliant contractors can work without fear of prosecution.  An integral part of the procurement process is the use of framework contracts, whereby a number of contractors who are pre-qualified participate in a framework agreement.  Framework agreements typically last two years.  It can cost considerable time and effort to pre-qualify for a framework agreement but it is the experience of the association's members that an integral part of the pre-qualification process is an interview with each tenderer to ascertain that the information submitted on the pre-qualification document is factually correct.  However, I have been informed that no member of the RSMCA has ever attended such an interview, yet some of its members are pre-qualified in respect of a number of framework agreements.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I thank Deputy Spring for raising this important matter.It is a condition of the public works contracts that contractors must comply with the relevant regulations governing employment conditions.  The most recent legislation in this area includes the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order, 2011, and the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay) Variation Order (No. 2), 2006.  The one exception, as referred to by the Deputy, is in regard to the registered agreement for pensions where a firm registered in another member state and working in this country has employees temporarily posted from that other jurisdiction and who subscribe to a national pension scheme in their own country.  In such circumstances, the firm, or its employees, does not have to subscribe to the Irish pension scheme.The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which has responsibility for monitoring employment conditions through its inspection services and which can enforce employment rights compliance and seek redress, comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who has responsibility therefor.  Where there is evidence that firms may not be complying with regard to relevant statutory pay and conditions of employment, the matter can be referred to the NERA for investigation.There are a number of provisions set out in the public works contracts to ensure compliance with the registered employment agreements and they are covered by a clause entitled "Pay and Conditions of Employment".  The main contractor is obliged to display a copy of the relevant clause from the public works contract covering the pay and conditions of employment in a prominent place on the site for the benefit of all those employed on the project.  The main contractor is also required to provide a certificate of compliance, entitled "Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate", with each interim statement submitted, normally on a monthly basis.  Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority.If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance and it is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue, the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor.  This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right.  The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.The public works contracts also oblige a contractor to maintain records of pay, timesheets and any deductions made for all those employed on the site.  These records are subject to inspections by representatives of the contracting authority, as required.  The conditions of the public works contracts, therefore, place an obligation on the main contractor to ensure compliance with the registered employment agreements for all those employed on the construction site, and this is not limited to their own employees but also applies to all sub-contractors who provide labour to the site.  Contracting authorities are required to ensure that the "Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate" is received with each payment application and, in the event of non-compliance, to withhold payment until the matter is rectified.If there is evidence that contractors employed on public works contracts are not complying with the payment requirements of the registered employment agreements, this should, in the first instance, be brought to the attention of the contracting authority, which can investigate the matter fully under the mechanisms set out in the contract and outlined previously.  Where members of the Road Safety Marking Contractors Association are making these claims, they should in the first instance make their complaints to the contracting authority, whether the roads authority, a local authority, or a group of local authorities, as in this case.  I will take a close interest in the outcome of any resulting investigation.  However, a complaint must be made in the first instance as, otherwise, there is no procedure through which we can investigate the matter and come to some determination.  Where there is a case to be answered, the contracting authority may then take the remedies set out in the contract for a breach of the clause on pay and conditions of employment and refer the matter to the National Employments Rights Authority.The Deputy has put very important information on the record of the House.  The responsibility now rests on the Road Safety Marking Contractors Association to make complaints to the authorities.  I will investigate those complaints closely.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I do not consider it is an issue of the association actually having evidence but, nonetheless, the rules under which its members are applying are not the same for non-Irish resident companies.  The examples are the construction workers pension scheme, to which the Minister of State referred, the compliance with Revenue regulations and so on.  The fact this is not auditable, is self-regulated and is written off without being examined means the level of integrity is just an assumption.  It is more difficult for Irish firms to do business here at present than for non-Irish businesses.I am asking for a level playing field.  As I pointed out, enough work is being created and businesses are doing a good job on what is often hazardous work, for example, on motorways.  However, we are creating work without benefitting from the jobs.  Some of the evidence with which I have been provided - the Department can ascertain this - demonstrates that 70% of the larger construction contracts have been won by non-Irish companies in the past two years.  That is a frightening statistic.  We are looking for our workforce to go out and do the work.  While I accept we have compliance issues, tendering processes and all the rest, I would point to the Spanish model where contracts have been broken down into smaller parts, with 25% for SMEs.  These people fit that bill.  I would like to see the subcontractors as well as the main contractors under the same level of scrutiny as Irish companies.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I have gained some experience in the area of procurement in the past eight months and these issues have been raised with me as the Minister of State with responsibility for procurement.  Evidence is the key issue, however.  Without evidence, we have no means of checking the facts and bringing these matters to a conclusion.Of course, Irish businesses win contracts abroad as well as at home.  International businesses domiciled in other countries win business in this country on a continuous basis.  I recently pointed out at a conference at which I spoke that close to 70% of SMEs in this country are not even registered on eTenders.  How can they possibly know about the contracts if they are not even registered to tender for contracts?Procedurally, there are very clear international European guidelines as to how companies contract and win this business.  It is a key objective of the Government to make sure Irish SMEs can pitch for and win this business.  Under circular 10/10, issued by the Department of Finance two years ago, we encourage SMEs to come together to pitch for business.  Any contract over â¬25,000 is now up on eTenders.  I use this opportunity on the floor of the House to encourage those Irish businesses, first, to register for eTenders, second, to pitch for the business and, third, to work with other SMEs as a means of getting this business.I pointed out that we have national framework agreements in place.  This is to protect the taxpayer and to get the best possible price and quality.  Nonetheless, I take the Deputy's point.  Some of these cases involve international businesses which win contracts but actually have Irish sub-contractors in place.  It is much more complicated than some associations like to present.I take very seriously the Deputy's remark that 70% of the road marking business is going to businesses outside the country.  I will investigate that matter thoroughly and come back to the Deputy on it.  If the veracity of that stands up and it is a fact, as he suggests, and I do not doubt him for a moment, there is a huge question mark over why Irish businesses are not winning these contracts or pitching for these contracts in a manner which ensures they offer the best and most efficient price for the taxpayer.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue affecting the Louth-East Meath constituency.  The threat to close St Joseph's Hospital, Ardee, and the Cottage Hospital, Drogheda, will have a profound and serious implication for the patients and staff of both institutions.  Both hospitals have given magnificent service to patients for many years.  Closure is unacceptable to the patients, staff and the communities they serve.Given the economic context, while we must have austerity at this time, we need austerity with compassion, sympathy and consideration for the vulnerable sectors in our community.  There is no more vulnerable sector than the elderly.  Those who have worked hard and served our nation well in its formative years now find themselves in some instances needing nursing home accommodation.  Unfortunately, as per the recent budget, they find themselves threatened with the closure of these homes.The HSE service plan for 2012 states that a minimum of 550 public beds will close in the course of the year.  However, if we examine the document more closely, we find the HSE reveals that the true number could be as high as 898 beds, which represents approximately an 11% cut in the number of beds in public residential care.  This has profound implications throughout the country.My particular concern today is St Joseph's Hospital, Ardee, the Cottage Hospital, Drogheda, and the rumoured reduction in the numbers of bed accommodation available in what is a state-of-the-art facility at St Oliver's, Dundalk, which was built as recently as the 1980s or early 1990s.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to advise us whether there is any basis to the rumours and, if not, to put at rest the concerns of the patients and the staff at the hospital.  If there is no basis to the rumours I ask her to put at rest the concerns of the patients and the staff in the hospital.There is no justification for the closure of these hospitals and there will be no benefit to the HSE because under the Croke Park agreement staff will have to be allocated to other HSE facilities in the area.  There is a high quality of care in the hospitals earmarked for closure and as far as I am aware HIQA has not reported any cause for concern in any of them.The treatment of the elderly by the Government is totally unacceptable.  The brunt of cuts will be borne by the sickest and poorest old people.  They are on low fixed incomes, have health needs and are dependent on the State for essential services.  This raises the fundamental question - how do we as a society treat our older people?  Do we cast them aside and forget about them?  Is the State dismissing care for the elderly as one of its core functions?  If the planned closure of so many community hospitals and nursing homes throughout the country proceeds as is apparently intended there will be profound implications.  Finding alternative accommodation in the private sector for those who, in many instances, have lived for years in those hospitals, will be extremely difficult.  It begs the question in a county such as County Louth where there are an estimated 16,000 people aged over 65 years.  I readily admit that the 16,000 will not all need institutional care but a percentage will at some stage.  More and more people are living to a much older age.  If I walk through any of the towns in my constituency I regularly meet people aged 90 and over.  Inevitably, they will need accommodation.I ask the Minister for State to put the concerns of elderly people in County Louth to rest by telling us she will not close the hospitals I mentioned.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I thank the Deputy.  From my additional notes I see the estimated population of people aged over 65 years in his county is 12,636.  There is a myth abroad which tells us that now we are living longer we will need additional nursing home beds.  The percentage of those of us who will need nursing home beds in the future will remain the same.  We are living longer and are healthier but this does not mean we will all end up in nursing home beds - nor will all the 90 year olds Deputy Kirk meets.  The percentage who do is 4.5% and I believe we should be able to deal with that.I have known the Deputy for some considerable time and it is not usually his form to make claims such as that people will have their nursing homes closed down.  That is scaring very vulnerable people.  As I know from my in-laws, people listen to and watch the proceedings in this House during the day.  It is unfair to frighten them.  I know the Deputy a long time but that is not his form.St. Joseph's nursing home, Ardee, is a listed Georgian building that is over 150 years old.  It provides accommodation on two floors for 23 people.  There are currently 19 long-term residents and four respite beds at the home.  I am sure the Deputy knows this better than I do.  The Cottage Hospital, Drogheda, was founded in 1908 and was taken over as a nursing centre by the HSE in 1988.  It provides 14 long-term care beds and 15 respite beds.  St. Oliver's Hospital is situated in the grounds of the Louth County Hospital.  It is a single-storey building that opened in 1987.  Accommodation is available for 92 residents in four separate units.  Two beds have been temporarily closed to conform to fire regulations.  The remaining 90 beds comprise 87 long-term care beds, 16 of which are specifically for people with dementia.  In addition, three beds provide a respite service to clients in the community.The Health Service Executive is currently examining the future use and development of public nursing homes in County Louth, taking into account the potential of these units to comply with HIQA standards.  In this regard a project group held its first meeting on Tuesday, 24 January.  The group is starting work on an optimal appraisal for the most appropriate service delivery model for elderly residential care in County Louth.  It has agreed a framework, with mid-March as the expected time for completion.  During the process, the project team will be in regular communication with all stakeholders - patients, families, staff and the wider community.The moratorium on recruitment and compliance with national quality standards are both impacting on the public nursing homes in Louth.  These pressures are mirrored across the country and are well documented.  I acknowledge there is a great deal of concern about the future of our community nursing units.  There is no doubt we are facing challenges in this sector due to staffing, funding and the age and structure of the existing units.  However, I can confirm that no decision will be made to close a public nursing home without a full consultation having taken place with all stakeholders.It is clear that, on a business-as-usual basis, the HSE would have to close further beds across a range of public community nursing units in 2012.  In the absence of reform, this would increase the cost of caring for older persons within the public system.  Consequently, this would undermine the viability of public community nursing units and reduce the overall number of older persons who can be supported within the budget available for the fair deal scheme.  This is not a sustainable way forward and would not meet the needs of older persons, local communities, the taxpayer or those working in the public service.  Instead we need a more proactive approach to the provision of community nursing home units which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available.  That includes smaller units where challenges of scale may require more innovative approaches to service delivery. This is likely to require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services and changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices.All developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and to the current moratorium.  I trust the Deputy and those listening will agree that we need to ensure the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I accept that.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The reality is that in recent weeks in County Louth, on the streets of Drogheda and Ardee, thousands of people have marched.  They have listened to Oireachtas Members and the various support and save committees, in both instances.  They say "hands off" the Cottage Hospital in Drogheda which is an iconic institution in the town.  Similarly with St. Joseph's in Ardee which at one stage had a much wider health care spectrum than it does nowadays.  However, it is a real institution in the town of Ardee and there is considerable attachment to it.  There is shock that consideration is being given to closing these hospitals.  At any of these meetings and protestations patients on wheelchairs are coming out and stating they want this accommodation to be retained in the nursing home service in County Louth.I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Department and report that the people and community of County Louth wish both nursing homes to be retained in the service.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I fully accept that.  That was the point I was trying to make.  I realise the Deputy is not doing this on his own, that it is a wider issue.  Equally, however, if we are to care for the percentage of older people who will eventually need the type of long-term care we are now providing we must look at things in a completely different way.  If one looks at any of the surveys, people will state they want to stay in their own community.  They want to live not only their active life but the end of their life in their own community.  There will always be people who will need the acute and ongoing care which exists at present in the hospitals the Deputy mentioned.  However, we cannot continue providing this care in the same way we always did.  We will have to look at alternatives.  We have groups of people looking at how we will provide that care in the future in a different way.This is probably the only area where we have not come up with a five-year plan for the future and we will need to do that.  We should be able to forecast how many people will need long-term care in a hospital setting and come up with an appropriate plan for them.  However, Deputy Kirk accepts when it comes to the country's finances we are in a very dark place.  I accept the people in question are not responsible for this.  That is where we are at, however, and we have to look at service provision differently.  It can be done.  People need to be reassured the provision of hospital services is being examined seriously and not let lapse in some kind of a vacuum.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise the important matter of the planned closure of the psychiatric unit at St. Michael's psychiatric unit, Clonmel.  This matter, the subject of much debate over the past several years, is a great concern to the people of Clonmel and south Tipperary, the facility's patients, their families, staff and everyone else associated with it.  The Minister of State is aware of these concerns and has dealt with them head on.The reality, however, is that admissions to the facility will stop on 1 March 2012.  The Minister of State, and her predecessor, gave the commitment that no closure would take place until new alternative community-based facilities were on the ground.  The concern is these facilities are still not in place.  From the note I have been supplied, there are also staff shortages of clinical psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists in the area, another grave concern.  Only some weeks ago, I, along with Deputy Mattie McGrath, travelled with the Minister of State to Wexford to visit a community-based mental health facility with which people there were very satisfied.  People in south Tipperary do not understand similar facilities will be in place in the area because they have not seen them rolled out yet.I implore the Minister of State to defer the decision to close the St. Michael's unit until all replacement facilities are in place.  Then people will be in a better position to make a judgment on these changes.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this matter this evening.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, already knows my views on this matter.  She has visited the St. Michael's unit at our request and we have had painless discussions on it.I am not going to repeat what Deputy Tom Hayes has just said.  However, I appeal to the Minister of State to honour her commitment that all community-based facilities are in place before the unit is closed.  So far, it has not happened.  In a recent article, a consultant in Clonmel described the closure of this unit as medical apartheid.The Minister of State knows better than I do the number of public servants in the health services who applied for retirement today.  Even before these retirements came into play, south Tipperary did not have the staff for community-based mental health services it requires.  I recently visited the replacement facility for St. Senan's in Wexford which was so new the paint was still wet.  While I thank the staff for facilitating our visit, the unit has not been up and running for several weeks and we have no experience of how it works.  Communities in south Tipperary have no reassurance as to how such a community-based approach will work for them.  We are in favour of A Vision for Change but not in the selective manner the Minister of State has introduced it.In the last Topical Issue matter, the Minister of State accused Deputy Kirk of scaremongering.  Will she rebut the claim she told the deputation of users and family carers from south Tipperary that the decision to close the unit was not set in stone but set in blood?  I hope these remarks were taken out of context.  To say it, however, to mental health service users and their carers would be inappropriate.  I note the Minister of State's official did not deny she might have said it.A new development now is that no patient will be admitted to St. Michael's after the end of February.  Instead, they will be sent on to facilities in Kilkenny.  This will diminish further the standing and staff of South Tipperary General Hospital.  This is a significant issue which already has seen 14,000 people on the streets protesting.  They will be on them again.  Two taoisigh, Brian Cowen, and Deputy Kenny have met deputations on this matter.  All we want is a reasonable amount of fair play and a full assurance that replacement facilities will be put in place.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	473	On the last Topical Issue, I did not accuse Deputy Kirk of scaremongering.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I said he should not scaremonger and that he also was not the type to do that.I thank the Deputies for raising this issue which gives me the opportunity to restate the Government's policy on mental health services.  The closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and the transfer of patients to more appropriate community-based settings are central to this policy and is a priority for this Government.  The evidence is overwhelming that a modern mental health service is best delivered in the community.  Hospitalisation should only be used in exceptional cases, and even then, only as a last resort.  The Government is, therefore, committed to developing community-based services.  Despite financial constraints, I was pleased we were able to announce a special new allocation of â¬35 million in last December's budget to be used primarily to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services along with improved integration with primary care.The implementation of A Vision for Change requires the amalgamation of south Tipperary and Carlow-Kilkenny into one catchment area for mental health services.  The inpatient bed requirement for the combined population of approximately 205,000 is 34 beds which will be provided in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny.  Accordingly, there will no longer be a need for inpatient beds in St. Michael's in South Tipperary General Hospital and the unit will close.The psychiatric unit at St. Luke's is modern and purpose built.  Service users will be able to avail of a much higher standard of physical inpatient environment there.  The unit has the capacity to support the wider extended catchment area and fully meets the requirements outlined in A Vision for Change.  The provision of the acute service for the extended catchment area from a single site will release resources to fund more modern community focused services for south Tipperary.As community mental health services are developed in south Tipperary, the service user will be offered alternative services more appropriate to their needs such as home treatment and community day services.  In this regard, south Tipperary mental health services are implementing a comprehensive change programme which is transforming the existing service into a modern, fit-for-purpose service providing a service of excellence to the local population.  The development of community mental health services in south Tipperary is underpinned by a comprehensive â¬20 million capital infrastructure programme.  This will provide a 40-bed community nursing unit, an acute day hospital and community mental health team base; a 12-bed high support hostel, and an eight-bed respite house.A Vision for Change represents the Government's mental health policy.  The developments and plans for the mental health services in south Tipperary are fully in line with that policy and enjoy mine and the Government's full support.  Service users in the region will reap the benefits from the significant improvement in quality and access to mental health services in south Tipperary.  I have conveyed again my commitment to the HSE that St. Michael's should not close until the appropriate community-based services are in place for the area concerned.  I trust this has clarified the issues for the Deputies.

The Minister for Health referred to a number of key policy proposals on the role of the special delivery unit in reducing waiting lists and achieving throughput in the acute hospital system.  However, the plan states in respect of older people: "It is expected that if the anticipated reduction in staff numbers materialises, a minimum of 555 public beds will close in the course of the year".  The plan goes on to indicate that up to 900 beds could close in the public nursing home system.  Certain patients in acute hospitals should be moved to step down or recuperative facilities but if we close these beds we face difficulties in trying to find alternative accommodation for them.  It is as sure as night follows day that there will be problems in placing people in step down accommodation if community nursing home beds are closed.

I remind the Minister that he passionately held that view only this time last year, when he stated that bed closures would result in delays and cancellations in elective surgery.  He was an advocate of more beds in the hospital system.  He is not credible when he now claims the exact opposite is the case.In regard to the idea that we can foist the beds onto community groups, many of these nursing homes need capital injections to meet the standards HIQA will be forcing on them and that will be difficult in straitened times.  The plan states: "This is likely to require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services; changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices; consideration of the public and private capacity available within an area and ... other voluntary providers".  The proposal to farm these community and public nursing homes out in the vain hope that voluntary organisations will keep them afloat is far-fetched to say the least.  If we are serious about using the special delivery unit to achieve throughput, step down convalescence facilities involving quality beds will be required.  That is what the Minister originally proposed but, unfortunately, taking as many as 1,000 beds out of the system will lead to a back log in the acute hospital system.We need to debate the question of universal health insurance prior to the implementation of the Minister's proposals because we are not sure what guidelines were laid down.  Has a cost analysis been conducted?  Will the public be expected to pay an inordinate amount in mandatory health insurance?  How will the means testing system be developed and how will entitlements to subvention to be decided?  We accept the need to provide some form of guaranteed funding to ensure people get treatment when they need it as opposed to if they can afford it.  Equally, however, it is a myth that universal health insurance will be free.  It will cost a lot of money.  People will have to pay considerable amounts for a mandatory health insurance system, either through general taxation or health insurance.  Either way, it will not be free.This time last year the Minister was almost falling over himself in apoplectic rage about the hike in the community rating levy of 11% or 12% yet he recently announced a 40% increase.  I cannot take him seriously given that this time last year he said this would drive families away from private health insurance and cripple them in terms of being able to afford health insurance.  However, two actions of his in the past six weeks have put enormous pressure on insurance companies and as sure as night follows day, even with the best will in the world on his part and his diktat, it will lead to increased premiums on hard-pressed families.  The idea that all insurance companies will be charged the full amount even if the patient is treated in a public bed will inevitably lead to increased premiums.His second decision was to apply a 40% increase on the community rating levy.  If a smaller percentage last year caused him such distress, surely a 40% increase will cause him more distress this year.  He blindly passed it off claiming it would not increase insurance premiums.  However, it has already increased insurance premiums and it will continue to increase them.  I am making the point that this is a serious issue.Everybody wants a system that allows people to access medical services based on need as opposed to ability to pay.  It is wrong to believe that those who have private health insurance are somehow an elite group with endless resources.  Many people are making great sacrifices to continue to pay their private health insurance premiums and are making very difficult choices about putting heating oil in the tank or paying for private health insurance.  Any increase puts enormous pressure on them.  The number of people falling out of private health insurance is astonishing.  Some 60,000 did so last year and it could be up to 100,000 this year.  While the Minister is talking about universal health insurance on the one hand, a group of people who are trying to provide as best they can for themselves and their families are being hard-pressed and forced out of health insurance.  The Minister's policies are not helping and are increasing the premiums health insurers will charge for cover.The difficulty is that it creates concern and anxiety among people who are asking whether they can afford to pay â¬3,000 this year and whether it is a waste of time paying for it.  If it is a waste of time paying for it and if the Minister has a grand plan for universal health insurance, he should publish it as quickly as he can and give people some comfort in knowing what will be ahead of them in the years to come.  Waiting until 2016 or 2017 and claiming it is a ten-year project creates enormous uncertainty in the meantime.

This is a plan for the wholesale destruction of services across all sectors of our health care system.  It is no wonder that the Government will do anything to avoid a referendum on the EU austerity treaty because this plan and the widespread cuts to vital services represent austerity in action.When Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, insulted the intelligence of the people by asserting that a referendum would be undemocratic, he said it would focus on issues not related to the referendum question.  Of course he and his colleagues know very well that a referendum debate will rightly focus on the cuts imposed by the Government because, if the austerity treaty is adopted, the State will be locking itself into an economic straitjacket that will mean years of further cuts to our services in health, education and social protection.This service plan spells misery in 2012 and beyond for people who use our health services and the staff who deliver those services.  These are the public health services on which we all depend, the public services that must still be provided while the private sector can pick and choose which services it will provide based on the profit motive.  The health budget reduction of â¬750 million as a result of budget 2012 comes after the â¬1 billion reduction in 2011.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has claimed that front line services can be preserved through greater efficiency.  This is directly contradicted by the plan which states "the bulk of the reductions that the HSE is required to deliver in 2012 will impact increasingly directly on frontline services".We now know that 3,500 staff are leaving the HSE at the end of this month and we also know that there is no plan to ensure that the services affected by this exodus will not be drastically curtailed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has tried to portray the redundancies as almost a technical industrial relations matter.  In truth this is all part of the drive to drastically reduce public services and the public pay bill in pursuit of the Government's doomed austerity programme.  The key point is that the recruitment embargo remains in place, with some exceptions, and that this further and dramatic exodus from the public health services will deal a body blow to the provision of services to patients.  The service plan states that it will have to be reviewed later this year depending on the numbers of staff leaving the service.  In other words we may be prepared for more cuts later in 2012.Again the plan contradicts the Minister's repeated assurances that front line care can be protected.  The plan states that "efficiencies will not compensate for the loss of frontline healthcare delivery staff in such large numbers".  The scale of these departures of staff from the HSE will mean a major blow to health services in this State.  Front line services cannot be maintained with such a scale of redundancies.  The loss of nurses in particular will mean a serious reduction in services for patients.Meanwhile, as the 3,500 staff depart, the Minister has signalled his intent to tinker with the bureaucracy at the top of the HSE, but without reducing the 110 senior managers on annual salaries of more than â¬110,000.  He should reduce these salaries and ring-fence all front line health service posts, lifting the recruitment embargo so that vital patient care can be provided.  In his contribution earlier, the Minister stated that he intends creating consolidated management structures.  I have no issue with less management given that we need more front line service providers.  However, he did not say earlier when he would announce the hospital groupings.Under this plan we face the loss of nearly 600 beds in public nursing homes which will be a devastating blow.  I am certain that communities will increasingly resist these cuts of beds and the threatened closure of homes across this State.  Last Saturday, along with Deputies representing all political views in this House, I addressed a rally in Ardee, County Louth, where St. Joseph's public nursing home is threatened with closure under this plan.  The Minister has put public nursing homes of 50 or fewer beds on notice.  They are told they are uneconomic and that they face closure.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, HIQA representatives confirmed, when questioned by my colleague Deputy Colreavy, that there are no inherent safety or quality issues with homes of fewer than 50 beds.  This is purely a budgetary measure.However, I believe it goes further.  There is clearly a move to close public nursing homes altogether.  The HSE can barely disguise its desire to abandon care of older people completely to the private sector.  The current accelerated trend began with Loughloe House in Athlone in 2010.  It has continued with other homes, including St. Brigid's in Crooksling, County Dublin, which has considerably more than 50 beds.  The Minister has ordered a brief moratorium in that case, but the intention of the HSE to close it is very clear.  It is a dangerous precedent that, if allowed to proceed, would spell the end of public nursing home provision in this State.  The cuts imposed in this service plan can only accelerate that process.  I remind the House of the statistics.  From 2001 to 2010 long-stay public nursing home beds for the elderly dropped from more than 10,000 to just above 6,000.During the same period the private nursing home capacity rose from well below 10,000 to over 20,000, supported by tax incentives.Repeatedly, we hear the assertion from the Minister and others that the emphasis in care of older people is switching from residential care to care in the home.  Yet, almost unbelievably, this service plan imposes cuts to home help hours.  We are told this is only by 1.2% but this is coming from a low base with existing provision of home help totally inadequate to meet the need that exists.  Given public nursing home bed closures, the pressure will increase to provide support for older people in their homes but this plan offers less, not more.The attacks on services to older people range from complete closure of facilities to the meanest of cutbacks in existing services.  For example, in the Minister's constituency the HSE is proposing to stop the preparation of cooked meals at Lusk Community Nursing Home and instead to transport meals from St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, which will be reheated or refrigerated in Lusk.  I believe this contravenes HIQA standards and I call on the Minister to put a stop to it and not to allow yet another such precedent to be set.The same story of cutbacks is true for people with disabilities.  The plan will impose reductions in day services, residential services and respite services.  We all know that these services are inadequate as they stand and that there is a growing burden on people with disabilities and on carers.  Much is made of the additional â¬35 million allocated to mental health, but last week at the Committee of Public Accounts the HSE chief confirmed to committee members that while he intends to take on 400 mental health staff, at least 500 mental health staff will leave the health service at the end of the month as part of the mass redundancy.  In mental health, as in other sectors of our health services, the Government has no plan to address the loss of numbers, the loss of experience, the loss of skill and the inevitable gaps that will appear in the front line in this unplanned and arbitrary redundancy programme.  I shudder to think of the consequences of this plan and of the mass exodus of staff from our acute hospitals.  Every Deputy can cite examples in his or her constituency.  Recently, management of Cavan General Hospital sanctioned cutbacks of 25% to its outpatient department staffing and it has begun radically reducing elective surgery at the hospital as and from last week.Members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation said they were appalled that management drew up such plans in the absence of any consultation or discussion at local level.  They said the plans will lead to excessive waiting times and the extension of waiting lists for patients in what is already an over-stretched service.  The limiting and reduction of elective surgery at Cavan General Hospital will mean longer waiting lists and further unnecessary suffering for patients awaiting surgery.  Late last year, we called for an inquiry into the disgraceful overcrowding in the accident and emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Cavan and Drogheda continue to suffer and face a worse situation in 2012 thanks to this service plan.Last October, I asked the Minister during an exchange between us if he agreed that more beds closed meant more patients suffering needlessly on trolleys and more patients waiting at home in pain due to cancelled operations.  Deputy Kelleher referred to this earlier.  The Minister replied: "I do not agree that more beds closed means more patients on trolleys and more people waiting".  Then, I pointed out that in May 2010 some 33 beds were closed in Beaumont Hospital but the Minister stated in the House: "More beds closed means more patients suffering needlessly on trolleys and more patients waiting at home in pain due to cancelled operations".  Those were the Minister's words.  The record shows it and it stands.  I make no apology for reminding the Minister and the DÃ¡il of that contradiction and I will continue to do so.Do the members of the Labour Party remember what their then health spokesperson, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, said almost one year ago on 8 February 2011?  She said in an interview in The Irish Times: âIn the first months of government, we will lift the moratorium on replacement of frontline staff where beds or operating theatres are closed because of a shortage of nursesâ.  There are people of conscience within the Labour Party and on the Labour Party benches in the House and I appeal to them to examine this service plan, to examine the austerity treaty and to ask themselves if this is what they wish to inflict on the people for the next decade and beyond.When it was put to the Taoiseach last week that leading obstetricians held that the exodus of staff and the cuts would put lives in danger, the Taoiseach responded by portraying that statement as an attack on the staff who are leaving.  Naturally, it was no such thing.  Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, one of the State's largest maternity hospitals, has stated that the hospital's midwife to patient ratios are already severely compromised.  He told the Irish Examiner: âYou reach a point when you canât stretch the service any further, and we are at that point nowâ.  He said he absolutely agreed with concerns raised by consultant obstetrician Dr. Gerry Burke, based in Limerick, that some women and babies may pay âwith their livesâ as midwives leave the service in droves.  Dr. Burke had stated that St. Munchinâs Regional Maternity Hospital in Limerick, which caters for more than 6,000 women and 5,200 newborns annually, will have lost 47 midwives from a staff of just over 200 through retirement.

Having said that, there can be no room for complacency. My concern is that unless we prioritise maternity services we will see in the future an increase in maternal deaths if we cut maternity resources too much - that is the price that will be paid.And then what usually happens is there is a crisis and a knee-jerk response. We could face the same danger with our perinatal mortality rates.He said the health service recruitment embargo had hit maternity care as it had other areas of the service.  I fail to see how the Minister finds all of this humorous.

It should be pointed out that Ireland has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians among OECD countries. Greece, which has also had the IMF in, has nine times as many obstetricians as we have.The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is presiding over a disgrace.  I have it to say that what the Minister is doing now is shameful and I call on him to stop these cuts, to lift the recruitment embargo on front line services and to commence the process of restoring to use a significant number of now closed public hospital beds.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I would have preferred more time to discuss the document.  Unfortunately, I have only five or six minutes so I will concentrate on my area of Waterford.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	520	Deputy, are you sharing time?
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I am sharing with Deputies Finian McGrath and Seamus Healy.Many of us are having great difficulty coming to terms with how the HSE expects hospitals to meet the ambitious targets for emergency departments and elective surgery set out in the national service plan while battling with an average budget drop of approximately 4.4%.  This is not possible.In my constituency of Waterford, for example, waiting lists for specialist treatment and surgery are about to get longer.  No amount of spin can gloss over the cold, hard reality of budget reductions coupled with the Government moratorium on staff recruitment and the expected increase in the numbers of staff retiring early due to the change in pension entitlements.  To put it candidly, with significant number of people leaving the service and the increasing numbers of people using the service, how can we possibly say we will have a service that is worthwhile?  That is not possible.  All one needs to do to realise this is to speak to nurses, doctors and front line service providers.  I am not saying the Minister does not do this - obviously he does.  We in opposition speak to these people every day of the week and they tell us what is happening with the service.  They tell us about the waiting lists, about how people are treated, about the extra hard work they have to do and about the stress they are under.  There is no question but that this is happening in hospitals all over Ireland.Waterford Regional Hospital serves 500,000 people across the south east, but it faces cuts up to â¬14 million, the departure of up to 70 nurses by next month and the closure of three of its eight operating theatres, a surgical ward and a number of inpatient and outpatient beds.  The shortage of nurses has already a caused a reduction in beds and the closure of an entire ward, with 25 beds taken out of commission.  On a personal level, last week a 92 year old friend of mine was left waiting in a chair for hours before he could get a bed.  There was not even a trolley for him.  How can this happen?  I do not question the Minister's integrity.  I listened to him when he was in opposition and liked what he said then.  I understand it is a difficult situation due to the budgetary cuts, but when a 92 year old man is left stressed and sitting in a wheelchair in 2012, we must ask what is happening in this country.  How come we allow this to happen?It is for this reason that I and other Deputies cannot support what the Minister has put before us.  We know that over the next number of months and years significant numbers of people will suffer.  We have no option but to talk to the Minister and the Government.  I do not like to use the word "blame".  I have said on a number of occasions that despite the difficulty I have with the Government, it must be given time to make changes.  I liked what I heard from the Minister when he was an Opposition Deputy, but now he is not listening to people on the ground.  He could not possibly be listening to nurses, doctors and those in accident and emergency wards.  If he was listening, he would know that things have become extraordinarily more difficult over the past number of months.  They will continue to become more difficult following the cuts in service.Putting the matter simply, if more people need and come in to use the health services while we cut down on numbers and do not replace them - we have a moratorium on recruitment - how can there be any improvement in the service?  It is not possible to improve the service in that situation.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I am sorry, but I must suggest to the Minister that he should come to Waterford.  He is always welcome in Waterford.  He should pop down to the Waterford Regional Hospital, which serves 500,000 people, and speak to the staff, nurses and doctors there.  He should visit at 5 a.m. on a Thursday or Friday morning and see what is happening in the accident and emergency ward and then tell me that the service is improving.  It is not.  I urge the Minister to revisit this and to lift the moratorium on staff recruitment.  This plan is a disaster and will not work.  It is a disaster in every hospital across Ireland.  Many other Deputies will say the same.  At the very least, the Minister should lift the moratorium.  If the does not, he will regret it in a number of years time.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I strongly endorse what my colleague, Deputy Halligan, said and thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the issue of the health service plan.  This is an extremely difficult time for our country and difficult decisions must be made, but leadership is also needed.  By leadership, I mean we need a Minister who is not afraid to hit the wealthy and elite in society and deliver health services to people on the ground.  We do not need more reports, plans, waffle or spin.  What we need is action and sensible investment in our health services.  We also need reform.  I emphasise the word "sensible", because the Government seems to have lost the run of itself with the measures it is taking to deal with the economy.  This has significant import for this debate.The issues of spending, tax and health are all linked and we should never forget that.  Last weekend, for example, the Nobel Laureate, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, asked an important question about the current international economic debt and banking crisis, namely, why taxpayers should have to give up health and education to make good on a private bank.  I totally agree with him and see this question as linked to the national service plan before us.Let us look at the details of the national service plan 2012.  It sets out the type and volume of health service and proposes a spend of â¬13.317 billion and caps then on employment.  Cost reductions proposed for 2012 are in the region of â¬750 million.  I accept that we must have reform and that this reform must begin now, but these proposals will have a substantial negative effect on our health service.  This is the basic plan, but the position on the ground is much worse.  Only today, I was told that an elderly disabled constituent of mine is to have his home help hours cut.  His family is in crisis as I speak.  This is not good enough.  Senior citizens or patients should never have to pay for the actions of the greedy and of those who wrecked this country.Let us look at proposed capital projects.  Value for money is the name of the game in the current climate.  For example, the cystic fibrosis unit for St. Vincent's Hospital was to cost approximately â¬30 million.  That cost is now down to between â¬20 million and â¬22 million.  Will that unit be on target and will the 34 cystic fibrosis beds be available this summer?  While this is an important capital project, it is even more important for patients and must be pushed to the limit to achieve it.  With regard to hospitals and reform, I agree we must have reforms and change in our health service.  We must go back to the basic vision of a universal health care service.Beaumont Hospital is in my constituency and yesterday I received a number of calls from families of patients who must visit the hospital regularly because members of their families are seriously ill.  These people must park at the hospital for many hours and the charges come to a significant amount daily.  I urge the Minister to do something for such families.  Not only must they suffer because a member of their family is seriously ill, they must pay a significant amount in parking charges.With regard to finance, the budget provision for 2012 represents a major challenge for us all and comes at a time when the Minister for Health is seeking cuts of â¬750 million.  As I said earlier, this will cause a major crisis in our health service.  In the case of services for older persons, the proposed cost reduction required averages 2.3%, but I notice a reduction of 4.5% will be applied to home help hours.  However, the Minister says that service efficiencies in this area will mean that despite this reduction, the number of people in receipt of home help will only be reduced by 1.2%.  Earlier, I mentioned the negative impact this will have on families.The allocation in the programme for people with disabilities will reduce by 3.7%.  Why are people ringing my office about this and why are people at the frontline telling me that people with disabilities are being asked to take cuts of from 7% to 10%?  These cuts will have a negative impact on services for people with disabilities and will mean a reduction in day care places and respite places.  Above all, it will impact the emergency situations that arise when elderly parents of people with intellectual disabilities die or when there is some other crisis in the family.  I urge the Minister to look seriously at this issue and bring in a serious health service plan.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	526	In the five minutes available to me, I would like to deal with the section in the report dealing with mental health services on pages 48 to 53, and specifically, the item on page 49 in respect of the closure of acute inpatient psychiatric facilities in HSE South.  This proposes the closure of 61 beds, 29 of which are in St. Michael's acute psychiatric inpatient unit at South Tipperary General Hospital, as the Minister knows well.  This matter has been raised for quite some time, and I hope that he can clarify the situation for us.The proposal to close these beds is a fundamental breach of the document, A Vision for Change.  That document, published in 2006, is something everybody in this Chamber completely supports, as do the stakeholders in south Tipperary.  That document is a policy for integrated services and holistic services for service users in any particular area.  It predominantly operates on a community basis, which we all completely support.  It also has a number of other elements such as inpatient acute services and specialist services.In breach of that policy, the HSE and the Department are going full steam ahead with the closure of the acute beds at St. Michael's unit in South Tipperary General Hospital.  There was no prior consultation on this.  It was announced overnight and all the stakeholders - service users, health professionals, be they medical or nursing, general practitioners, the general public and professionals in the unit in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny where these beds are to be moved - are all opposed to this development and they have informed the Minister of their opposition.  It fundamentally breaches the terms of the document, A Vision for Change and the policy from that document.  That policy is crucial in its reference to access for service users to inpatient services and access for carers and family members to those services.  It allows for the provision of a 25 bed unit in both Kilkenny and south Tipperary.  We are asking that the policy be implemented in south Tipperary.The HSE and the Minister of State have said on numerous occasions that this closure would not go ahead until the community based services were in place.  I can confirm that the executive director, the hospital manager and the director of nursing have informed staff that the unit will close to admissions on 1 March and will close completely on 31 March.  The other services are not in place.  There is no crisis house.  The high support hostel is not ready.  The home-based teams do not have allied health professionals.  There is no social worker, no psychologist and no occupational therapist.  There are no on-call arrangements in place and there are no arrangements for service users to attend accident and emergency departments.I am making a personal appeal to the Minister this evening.  He has met us in south Tipperary on a number of occasions, and I thank him sincerely for that.  He knows that we are reasonable people and I ask that he clarifies this issue and instructs the HSE not to go ahead with the closure on 1 March-----

It is a fundamental breach of the policy but is also a breach of the promises that have been given about other services being in place before any beds close at St. Michael's unit.  Those services are not in place and I ask the Minister to clarify the position, to stop the closure and to allow for admissions to continue after 1 March, and to meet a deputation of stakeholders from south Tipperary.  He knows that we are reasonable people and he should give us an opportunity to clarify these issues with him.

As was the case in 2011, this year will once again provide severe challenges to the Minister, his Department and all of the medical and administrative staff working in the health services in our country.  By the end of 2012, a total of â¬2.5 billion will have been taken out of the health budget over the past three years.  There will also be a significant reduction in staff numbers over the next few months.  It is important to compliment the Government, and this Minister in particular, on the fact that the commitment to a single tier health service based on need rather income remains in place, and more importantly, on target.This morning in the DÃ¡il, a former Minister for Health and now leader of Fianna FÃ¡il and the Opposition said "I do not care about monitoring".

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	534	This was more or less the case from the time the HSE was established by Deputy Martin and in all subsequent Governments of which he was a member.  Ironically, monitoring - dismissed by Fianna FÃ¡il-led Governments - remains at the heart of the difference between this Minister and his immediate predecessors Cowen, Martin and Harney.  He is targeting objectives and monitoring how these targets are performing.  This plan commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services from budget and staff reductions by using reduced resources more efficiently.  It crucially commits to moving to new models of care across all areas of service which treat patients.  This will be done at the lowest level of complexity and will provide quality services at the least possible cost.  This is not only financially preferable, but also far better for the patient.I  particularly welcome the significant strengthening of primary care services, some of which will indeed be located on the site of St. Mary's medical campus on the north side of Cork city.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	535	Is that another promise?
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	536	These include the issuing of GP visiting cards to people with long-term illnesses.  This is another step on the planned and monitored march towards free GP care for all, and ultimately the Government's stated objective of universal health insurance.While the Opposition will understandably focus on some perceived and indeed real reductions in services caused by the Government's obligation and requirement to move Ireland back to solvency and independence, it is also important to acknowledge areas of reform and improvement.  These include proposals to protect the viability of community and nursing units and to increase the capacity of immediate care for elderly people.  An additional â¬35 million will be allocated to child and adolescent services, which also confirms the Government's commitment to young people in our country.  They are our most valuable resource and for the first time they have a voice at Cabinet through our excellent Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Other targeted areas are included, such as a tailored approach to disability, the commencement of colorectal screening, priority funding for the HPV and MMR vaccines and the progression of clinical care programmes such as the national disease management programme for diabetes.It is important to correct some of the allegations made today by the Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson, because the Minister has always made it clear that long-term care in the public sector will continue to be protected.  It is reasonable to ask why this form of care costs 50% more in the public sector than in the private sector.  I am pleased the Minister is addressing this issue.The House is today discussing the reform agenda.  Last week, I had the pleasure of attending a national forum of key stakeholders in the health service at which the Minister identified four key reform priorities for 2012.  These are to deliver on the special delivery unit's agenda, further overhaul the health system's governance, change the model of care and reform the health insurance sector.  Targets and monitoring were the main purpose of last week's gathering of the people running the health system.  The special delivery unit has already had a significant impact on hospital performance and is improving patient experiences in a tangible manner.  Improvements in these areas are taking place for the first time in many years.Several Deputies referred to people waiting on trolleys.  The Government's view is that it is unacceptable for anyone to wait on a trolley.  It is important, however, to refer to a bold statement made by the Minister last year when he set priorities for 2011 because it caused amusement and raised eyebrows at the time.  The cumulative number of patients waiting on trolleys in the first two to three weeks of this year was 27% lower than in the same period last year.  While the number of people waiting on trolleys remains too high, last month was the first time such a significant reduction was recorded.On waiting lists for scheduled care, last year the Minister directed that all public hospitals were to ensure they did not have any patients waiting for more than 12 months by the end of 2011.  With the exception of one or two hospitals in Galway, this target was achieved.Last week, the Minister announced his targets and objectives for 2012.  The maximum period anyone should wait for elective care has been reduced from 12 to nine months.  Cumulative improvements and targets are being introduced which can and must be achieved.  This will be all the more difficult given the economic climate and reductions in budgets.  One of the new targets is that no one should wait on a trolley for an emergency bed for longer than nine hours.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Is it acceptable to have people waiting for nine hours?
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	538	No one should wait for two hours for a bed.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Furthermore, under the new targets, 95% of people should not wait for more than six hours for an emergency bed.  While the Government agrees that no one should be on a trolley, if anyone believes the disastrous position that pertained in the health system over the past 14 years can be cleaned up and changed in one month, one year or even two years, he or she is seriously delusional.  Steady and large reductions in waiting times are being achieved.  The special delivery unit will also set and implement targets for improved access to outpatient and diagnostic services in the first quarter of 2012.I wish the Minister and his staff well.  For the first time in years, it must be acknowledged that some key areas of the health service are improving, even if not all battles or wars have been won.  While there is still scope to target other areas, there is light at the end of the tunnel and evidence to show that the targeting, monitoring and direct control of the HSE by a competent and experienced Minister who understands his portfolio is delivering benefits.I emphasise that the facts and figures I have cited on waiting lists and the people on trolleys were compiled not by officials in the Department or Health Service Executive but the nursing unions.  They alone are tabulating and delivering the figures for everyone to see.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Health Service Executive's plan for the health service for 2012.  As public representatives, Members interact daily with the HSE and health service on behalf of constituents.  We also do so in our family roles.I will address a number of issues.  Home helps provide value for money in providing services for people who need help in their own homes, primarily elderly people.  Since being introduced on a structured basis, the home help service has delivered major benefits for patients, their families, the wider community and, by extension, the State.  Home helps have achieved great success in keeping people in need of assistance in their own homes and local communities.  For this reason, any reduction in the home help service should be carefully targeted.Delays in processing medical card applications have been raised in a number of forums in recent weeks.  In many cases, those who are forced to wait for medical cards have been diagnosed with serious illnesses.  Having been informed by their general practitioner or consultant that they have an entitlement to a medical card, they are encountering serious difficulties in securing their entitlement.  The system used to provide medical cards needs to be challenged and taken by the scruff of the neck, so to speak.  Those applying for medical cards tend to be on the lowest incomes and are, therefore, highly vulnerable.  Public representatives, whether Members of the DÃ¡il or Seanad or local authority councillors, are being contacted by a large number of people.  We have seen at first hand people who have been diagnosed with serious illnesses and must have a medical card if they are to pay for their medication.  Not only must they deal with their illness and the financial burden of their diagnosis but they must wait for long periods to receive a medical card.  The Minister should give a commitment to address blockages in the system.  He should issue a directive requiring that problems in the current shambolic system be ironed out.In recent weeks, I had reason to speak with a hospital consultant who informed me that in his 25 years working in the health service he has never seen circumstances as bad as they were in recent weeks.  He noted that whereas budgetary issues are usually not a major theme in January, he has been forced to cancel more day and theatre procedures than at any other time in his career.  He asked me to raise this issue in the House.  It is not possible to have all diagnostic procedures and other treatments carried out in the primary care sector.  There is a fundamental need for hospital services to be backed up in every way possible and to ensure accident and emergency services and admissions are properly resourced.  He was genuinely concerned about his patients and what he saw around him and was not making a political point, good, bad or indifferent.  The situation is difficult and challenging at the moment.Over the years Mallow General Hospital has provided a huge service to the people of north Cork and beyond.  In any assessment of Mallow General Hospital, it always has been said that it is one of the most efficient hospitals.  It is the first point of call for many people.  In downgrading services or amalgamating services into centres of excellence or whatever, it is vitally important we acknowledge the contribution hospitals, such as Mallow General Hospital, have made to the State over the years.It is vital that Mallow General Hospital is protected because in Cork, everything is being centralised into Cork University Hospital and other places.  When elderly relatives of mine go to Cork University Hospital, it is chaotic not only inside the hospital but outside it.  Any attempt by the HSE, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health or the Government to downgrade any of the services in these communities would be a retrograde step. It would have disastrous consequences not only for the HSE delivering the plan but in regard to the fundamental issue of money.In recent weeks, there has been huge concern about the preservation of community hospitals. It could be a case of penny wise and pound foolish.  Over the years these community hospitals provided even more services.  By and large, they take in acute medical cases who need long-term care and assistance while the nursing homes take the other people.  There are three community hospitals in my local area - Macroom, Millstreet and Kanturk - all of which have provided a huge service.  Those three centres have been commended by HIQA on the care they provide.  In the first instance, we must consider the residents of those community hospitals who are attached to their communities in a very significant way.  They also have family support in their communities and can be visited by friends and neighbours.The policy always has been to accommodate the acute medical cases.  All but one of the patients served by the 38-bed Macroom Community Hospital are maximum or high dependency, meaning that most of them could not be cared for at home or even in the standard nursing home facilities.  In the most recent inspection report on Macroom Community Hospital, HIQA stated:Many factors contributed to the residents' quality of life.  Relatives and friends visited the centre regularly and there was a sense of warmth and familiarity between staff, residents and relatives.  The centre had a homely atmosphere where residents were encouraged to be independent and residents were encouraged to remain in contact with family and friends.  Residents' health needs were overall well monitored and met.To close Macroom Community Hospital would scatter these patients all over the community and their connections, which were rightly highlighted in the HIQA report, would be shattered.  This would add to the congestion in the regional hospitals or lengthen the nursing home waiting lists.  Likewise, Kanturk Community Hospital provides excellent and essential care.Over the years, the communities have been hugely supportive of these three community hospitals.  They have raised funds for the day centres or for enhancing their facilities.  I suppose the communities take ownership of these hospital.  The biggest difficulty with State institutions, no more than the issues in regard to the EU, is that we must bring the people with us.  Communities should take ownership of their hospitals, schools and so on.  It is vitally important that the contributions people have made to maintain these hospitals and the fund-raising they have done is acknowledged and maintained.Patients in St. Joseph's Community Hospital, Millstreet, commended it.  There have been huge advances in creating a better environment in that hospital.  Pope John Paul II said that anyone of goodwill and good sense must agree that a society must be judged on how it treats its weakest members.  It is vitally important we remember that when we reflect on the ethos in the community hospitals and the good work being done in them.  We must commend them.  The Department and the HSE should tread carefully and should look at the excellent work being done in these facilities and not take a blunt instrument to them.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the HSE national service plan for 2012.  It must be said that the overall financial and service challenges facing the HSE this year are very significant.  This is probably the most challenging period ever faced by our health service.  We will not be able to deliver the kinds of services we want to deliver for our citizens without serious reform.  This is the case across all care groups, including the child and family services.When we focus on a report like this, there is a tendency to focus on cuts and what people are afraid will not be delivered but it is equally important to focus on what is being delivered and committed.  In the case of the HSE, â¬13.3 billion of spending is committed to in 2012.  We must ensure that spending is used in a way that is effective, efficient and delivers the services we want for our citizens.  I commend my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and his colleagues, Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and RÃ³isÃ­n Shortall, on their commitment to reform and on the amount of work they are doing to ensure services are delivered and that the reform agenda is progressed in all areas.The service plan this year is rooted in reforms aimed at ensuring the reductions in funding, which are real, will not mean an equivalent drop in the level of service, in particular through fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways to deliver services supported, for example, by the work of the special delivery unit. I take the points made by Deputy Michael Moynihan on the delivery of medical cards.  The Minister for Health has taken action in this regard.  It is unacceptable that forms get lost and that the service is not delivered efficiently to people who badly need those medical cards.  It is not good enough.  We must provide a service to citizens at the core and ensure that the kinds of services we want to deliver are delivered in a speedy and efficient way.The same applies to the points Deputy Michael Moynihan made about the elderly.  While I will focus on my areas of child and family services, I would say in regard to the elderly that it is unacceptable that so many elderly have not been offered the kind of community care packages which would keep them in their communities and at home.  That is something we need to consider  It is an area which is being focused on more in terms of the delivery of the fair deal scheme.  We need to ensure people are offered the range of community services which will ensure they are not forced into residential care but can remain in their communities.As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, reform is very much part of my agenda and it is central to the work of the HSE child and family services, led by the national director, Gordon Jeyes.  As everybody in this House knows, there have been too many reports which have highlighted problem areas in child protection services.  We have had at least 16 reports on child protection services and we have also had the very serious reports on clerical abuse.  We have had the Monageer inquiry report, the Ryan report, the Roscommon child care inquiry report and, more recently, the HSE national review panel reports on serious incidents, including the death of children in care, and the HIQA inspection reports on foster care and special care services.Analysis has not been lacking - and it is quite disturbing in many cases - about the kind of care we have provided to children.  Some common themes have emerged from those reports, in particular the need for greater clarity and consistency in practice, enhanced inter-agency working, more consistent assessment, and more equitable distribution of HSE resources based on assessed need.  It is no longer good enough to have the same number of people in every area, we need to match personnel to the demands of particular areas.  The demands concerning child protection are very different in different counties.We need to develop more targeted family support services, better training for our managers and staff, more staff supervision, and more reliable data collection.  As Minister, I have been very disappointed by the quality of data I have been able to access concerning child protection services.  I got one audit and the figures were simply not comparable across areas because people were not comparing like with like.  That is not good enough.  If we want to plan services we must have adequate comparable data, which must be relevant, immediate and consistent.I expect the upcoming report of the independent review group on child deaths to provide further stark evidence of past failings over the decade 2000 to 2010.  That report is currently with the Attorney General and as soon as there is legal clearance I will publish it.This year marks the 20th anniversary of Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  We can mark this anniversary and make it a national cause to ensure that these problems are of the past and not of the future.I would like to say a few words about the change agenda within child and family services.  It is aimed at strengthening the organisational capacity, business processes and systems required to deliver safe and reliable child protection services.  We must be able to do so.  That change agenda is necessary in order to utilise resources to the full, promote better outcomes for children and achieve Government objectives for the improvement of the child protection system.  In time, this will constitute an important and demonstrable example of the benefits of the Government's approach to public sector and public service reform.The change agenda, which I am leading in the Department, will result next year in the establishment of a new and dedicated child and family support agency, as committed to in the programme for Government.  This year's health service plan paves the way for that transition.  We now have for the first time a dedicated subhead for child and family services within the HSE vote.  In the programme for Government, we said we would separate out child protection systems from the HSE's other work, because it has not worked as part of the larger HSE service.  This significant change will bring about greater transparency and budgetary control.  We have a separate budget now, which is an important first step in beginning this transition.The 2012 provision for child and family services is â¬568 million, which represents an increase of 4% compared to the 2011 budget.  However, there will still be a requirement to control excess spending which caused severe budgetary difficulties in 2011.  Accordingly, an average reduction in expenditure of 7% will be required to bring spending back from the 2011 outturn levels to the budget provision in 2012.  Notwithstanding the financial constraints applying, I welcome the decision to provide an additional budget of â¬40 million to support child welfare and protection services this year, and to deal with the kind of budgetary problems that have arisen in the area in recent years.  This reflects the priority the Government attaches to child and family services, and is an acknowledgement of the very real financial pressures experienced within this area in recent years.I would like to give the House some idea of the areas where these pressures are being created.  We have an increasing number of children coming into care of about 5%.  We also have an increase in families seeking housing and support to cope with children.  An increasing number of families are seeking help from our social services, including child care.  There is an increase in such cases being referred to the courts, in addition to the increased costs of detention and special care.  We also have increased costs arising from guardian ad litem cases.  It is important that children should have somebody to represent them in court in certain cases, but this comes at a cost.  We need to improve the way we manage this so a management system is required.  This service was set up without any management structure. Other key areas for the Department include the progress of a children first national guidance, which will be put on a statutory basis.  I have established an interdepartmental committee to ensure that work is done in and across all Departments so that every Department is conscious of the need to implement child protection policies.  This work is under way.We also have a lot of work to do in developing and establishing a national child protection register, as well as developing consistent risk assessment, which applies across the whole health sector, and measurement tools.  A greater focus on quality assurance and auditing of workloads is also required.  We must also prepare and implement a workforce development plan for child and family services.  We intend to develop the important implementation of national standards for preschool services.  An out-of-work social service is a key priority for this year.I look forward to working closely with Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the HSE's national director of child and family services, to deliver on the areas I have referred to.  It is an ambitious programme of work and will significantly strengthen policy, legislative and practice frameworks in delivering the range of services I have outlined.  It is not good enough to continue services as was done in the past.  The various reports I mentioned have illustrated the failings involved and, thus, the need for change.  I acknowledge the work that is being done around the country by the dedication of the many staff involved in this area.  It is a demanding area in which to work, involving huge demands and increased financial pressures.  In that context, staff have to deliver a quality service to children and families who come to them for help.  It is challenging and demanding but the Government has the will to meet that challenge.  I have the support of my Government colleagues to deliver the programme as outlined for the House.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I have a good deal of understanding for the predicament the Minister and her colleagues are in as she tries to grapple with the crisis in our health care system.  In this regard, the Minister was handed a poisoned chalice by the previous Government.  I am not sure, however, that the Minister and her colleagues are aware of the real fears Irish people have as they contemplate the future.  I am sure that Government backbench Deputies are aware of what is happening to our health care services because they are hearing about it in their clinics.  Nonetheless they seem to have adopted a Trappist vow of silence and are not reflecting the views of their own constituents.Not alone is the health system in crisis, but it is also an apartheid system.  We still have the awful phenomenon where ability to pay can determine the speed of access to health care services.  That is an apartheid system which is simply not good enough.  Sinn FÃ©in seeks to create a democratically accountable, national health service that is responsive to the diverse needs of the population as a whole, and that is flexible enough to provide the highest quality care appropriate to individual needs.  However, we currently have a health care system that is in crisis and there is very little leadership.  We hear much talk of change but see no evidence of it on the ground.  In addition, there is very little accountability and only vague promises of change to resolve the myriad problems that are arising.In the constituency I represent, Sligo Leitrim North, there was an outcry when breast cancer services operating to a very high standard at Sligo General Hospital were withdrawn.  There must be a re-examination of the cancer control strategy.  We still have ill people from Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo travelling to Galway and back, which is not a good service.  The policy must be revisited and one of the key aspects of it must be access to the service.  There is a lack of stroke service facilities at Sligo General Hospital, which was promised but never happened.  We were promised a mammography service would be restored to Sligo General Hospital by the end of last year but that has not happened yet.  There have been myriad resource and staff cutbacks for acute hospitals.  Staff in hospitals may not be telling the Minister this but they tell me that when someone is sick, is on maternity leave or retires, staff are not replaced.  The staff are beyond stretching point.Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton has an excellent regional rheumatology service.  Two consultant rheumatologists provide an outstanding service and relieve many patients of severe pain.  One is going on maternity leave and cannot be replaced because of the staff embargo.  Waiting lists of one year will extend to two years and no human can say that to leave someone with acute arthritic pain for two years without a consultant is a good service.  It is a disgraceful service and we deserve better.There are threatened cutbacks to longstay nursing homes throughout Sligo and Leitrim and real fears that nursing home beds will be closed because, allegedly, the nursing homes cannot provide a gold standard service due to lack of finance or human resources.  People who should not stay home will do so because the gold standard is not available in public hospitals.The most insidious of all is the threatened reduction in the number of home help hours.  It is the most effective and best value service in the range of health care services.  Home help hours have been reduced and non-replacement has also been threatened with regard to critical front line staff who will retire in great numbers at the end of this month.  We do not yet know the impact.  The public dental services are virtually non-existent in the area.The CEO of HIQA was invited to attend a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children two weeks ago and acknowledged the growing challenge of ensuring quality while slashing expenditure in public health care services.  At some stage HIQA and the people must say that enough is enough.  If health care was a passenger aircraft, we would have been called in long ago by the Irish Aviation Authority and grounded due to safety concerns for passengers.  I refer to the shambles that surrounds the centralisation of processing of medical card applications.  People who are desperately in need of medical cards must wait months instead of weeks for eligibility decisions.  In the meantime, they cannot afford to pay a GP, they cannot afford prescriptions and other essential medical needs.  An increasing number of people are marginally outside the eligibility guidelines.  People with chronic illnesses are being turned down and it is a mathematical calculation used with no reference to illnesses.Several years ago, I heard my party colleague, Deputy CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in, speak about death by 1,000 cuts in health services.  The cuts are getting deeper and the wounds are fast approaching the point of no return.  There is an alternative to this.  Sinn FÃ©in promotes a new universal public health system that provides care for all, free at the point of delivery on the basis of need alone and funded by general, fair and progressive taxation.  That can still be done.  There must be a fundamental reorientation of the health system to adopt a central focus on prevention, health promotion and primary care, including mental health care.  Ultimately, we must eliminate the underlying social and structural causes of ill-health and premature death, such as poverty and inequality.  We need a reorientation and roll-out of the promised primary care centres throughout the State on an accelerated timescale.  Decisions about acute hospitals are being made on the pretence that primary care has improved.  That is fiction.  Decisions on cutbacks in acute hospitals made in advance of improvements to primary care only reduce the choice and increase the timescale for sick people getting into hospital when they need it.Has the Minister of State wondered why thousands of people entitled to receive public health care in acute hospitals pay increasingly big bucks for private health insurance?  The reason is that they do not trust the public health care system.  They feel the public health care system will not be there for them and their families when they need its services.  People prefer to see money invested in health care and the education rather than to increase the income of greedy financial gamblers and zombie banks.  Quality health care is a labour-intensive industry and cannot be done on the cheap.  People would not mind paying fair taxes for a quality, one-tier health care system, provided it is delivered fairly, efficiently and effectively.  Health care needs will increase over the coming years and decades.  It will not decrease because we have an increasingly elderly population.  Access to quality health care is a right, not a privilege that can be withheld at the whim of Government, the troika, the EU or anyone else.  We cannot continue to deliver a quality service at bargain basement prices.  There must be a baseline, below which we cannot go.  We have fallen below the baseline.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I propose to share time with Deputy Mulherin.  The budget provision for 2012 will be a major challenge for the HSE and comes at a time of significant reform of the public health system.  The total cost reduction in 2012 will be â¬750 million.  At the end of 2011, the employment control framework target for the HSE is 105,300.  The HSE estimates that the actual number employed at the end will be 104,500, some 800 under the ceiling.  There is also a plan to provide for the recruitment of about 400 staff from mental health services on foot of the additional â¬35 million in expenditure.  The closing date for retirement applications has arrived and some 3,700 staff have retired in the period from September 2011 to February 2012.  A contingency plan has been developed at the local HSE level in the context of the national and regional services process.  All regional plans are being developed on the basis of anticipated numbers of staff.On Monday, December 2011, I as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, called on the Minister and chief executive of the HSE to make the situation regarding possible nursing home closures clear as soon as possible.  I also expressed the concern of the people of Louth about the possible closure of the nursing home in Drogheda, the Cottage Hospital, and St. Joseph's in Ardee.  Since that request the Minister has met with both nursing homes and given them options and hope, which I appreciate.  Both have also had meetings with the HSE.  St. Joseph's Hospital has received a promise from the HSE that an appraisal will be done by the end of March.  It has also agreed to meet on 24 February 2012 to give the hospital an updated progress report.I refer to the special delivery unit, SDU.  Its priorities have been set by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The first priority is a reduction in the number of patients spending long periods of time on trolleys and the second is the reduction in the number of people on the inpatient waiting list.  As can be seen by recent results, this is happening.  It is worth noting that 15 hospitals are responsible for approximately 80% of the trolley waiting list and if we look further we find eight hospitals were responsible for almost 60% of the problem.The SDU has spent a considerable time analysing the problem in our hospitals and has had latitude to consider the situation on a multi-hospital basis.  Each of the relevant eight hospitals was invited to the SDU to seek support under certain headings.  The requested support has been analysed by the SDU in consultation with the HSE.In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, the hospital has requested a range of support and the SDU has agreed to a set of proposal at a cost of â¬725,710.  The main measure of approval for the hospital was to extend the AMAU to 18 hours seven days a week; open eight medical beds in Drogheda; open an additional 28 low acute beds in the Louth county Hospital in Dundalk; open an additional 27 low acute beds in the community; and organise additional long-term beds.I was glad to hear the Minister, Deputy Reilly, say today that he had plans for the future of the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk.  It is a minor injury unit, open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.  There is an attendance fee of â¬100 but patients referred by GPs or who have medical cards are exempt from the charge.  There is a stroke and rehab unit and palliative medical ward in the hospital.  Day services include a haemochromatosis clinic, an elderly assessment unit, a cardiac rehab unit, cardiac services,  pre-assessment clinics, a diabetes day centre and a heart failure clinic.  The outpatient clinic includes general medicine, gynaecology, antenatal care, paediatric care, orthopaedic care, vascular care and a warfarin unit.  It also has physiotherapy services, a radiology department, CT services, ultrasounds, occupational therapy, laundry and theatres.  It has outstanding facilities and I thank the Minister for his help.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	544	In response to Deputy Colreavy, not a day goes by that the enormity of the tightrope being faced in the delivery of health service is not starkly clear to me and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who are involved in this area.  They hear a large number of stories and have much with which to contend.  There is also the human side of wanting to give a service to people, which is overwhelming.We know the system is crying out for reform and efficiencies.  Aside from our economic crisis, the most pressing area is health because we cannot choose when we become ill, are dying or have a disability.  It is a time we would like to think help is available and the State is there for us.  Illness does not discriminate between those from poor or wealthy backgrounds.  People want the service to be in place.  It is important that we reform the system.  It is the most difficult area and one which frightens me.The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has made a clarion call which he wants to follow through on.  Let us be under no illusion.  There are many vested interests who do not want anything to change and do not want to address efficiencies, and we know why.  People do not want to change job practices and so on.  These realities are faced every day.  The system will not change overnight but if we steer the ship in the right direction it is to be hoped we will end up at the right destination, which is the objective.The talk is about efficiencies, reform and so on.  If one looks at how sub-areas in the HSE are trying to react, one will find efforts are being made in local areas.  I can speak for my area in particular.  There is a district hospital in my  town which is considering closing beds because of a lack of staff.  A solution which has been applied in St. John's Hospital in Sligo is being considered.  The hospital might bring in home helps to help with cleaning, which would alleviate staff to support nurses and keep beds open.  I am very hopeful that will happen.  Unions have to be very responsible in encouraging people to be flexible and responsive so we can deliver health care under the constraints that exist.  Nobody is losing his or her job, people are being asked to be flexible.In terms of efficiencies being achieved, since this time last year there has been a reduction of 70% in the number of people waiting on trolleys in Mayo General Hospital.  The national average is 20%.  All the efficiencies, green lights and health statistics have brought the hospital into the top five list of efficient hospitals in the country.  I commend the hospital manager, Charlie Meehan, the HSE manager, Frank Murphy, and the staff and management who are working together to achieve efficiencies through the reconfiguration of medical and surgical beds, increasing the number of day cases and a more efficient use of step-down facilities.There are also plans in the pipeline which, it is to be hoped, will come to fruition to extend the renal dialysis unit and build a cystic fibrosis unit.  There is also what I believe is a unique initiative, the lean academy.  People working at management level in multinational companies in Mayo work with hospital management on the leaner and more efficient delivery of services.  We are getting the know-how and expertise from people in multinational companies who give their time voluntarily to try to achieve efficiencies.There comes a point when people hit a wall.  The reality is that even if we are achieving efficiencies we are contending with a moratorium.  At some point soon we will have to consider replacing front line staff.  We can have all the fine structures we want but if we do not have nurses to look after people in bed we will not have a service.  Without a doubt, anybody speaking truthfully would say it is a problem.  The problem is the economic crisis in the country.  The patient has to be of paramount interest and has to be what motivates us, and there should be an alarm bell when that is not happening.There are many ways in which services can be delivered and they are being explored.  Just because they are not under the traditional heading of how services should be delivered not mean they cannot be delivered in another way.  It is a serious challenge.  There are delays in people in getting approval from exemptions to the moratorium, ranging from a year to 18 months.  If we are serious about exemptions they should be delivered.The fair deal package is unsustainable and we have to consider other ways of allowing people to be cared for in their homes.  People should only need to go into homes for medical reasons and should be supported in their old age, no matter what disabilities they may have.  It would be a lot cheaper to give incentives to people to give up work, stay at home and still get a stamp.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	547	There are several things at which we are very bad in this country, one being the building of institutions.  We have no history of doing so and we inherited our education, local government and health systems.  When the latter was reformed, it was not really reformed.  What happened is that the HSE was lobbed in on top of the health board system, and the oversight role of councillors was removed.  There was never any real reform.  Reform presents a big challenge, which I fully acknowledge.  The challenge has been inherited by the Government at a very difficult time.There are very many excellent people working in the HSE who are going way beyond the call of duty.  Let us not put everybody into the one basket and engage in a blame game because doing so is unfair, demoralising and counter-productive.Let me refer to the service plan.  People are appalled at the lack of targeting in the downsizing approach.  There is some very blunt language in the document.  I have been saying for the past few months that it does not make sense to make staff redundant through early retirement and then recruit others.  This does not result in a saving; it shows a lack of certainty in the Government's approach.  This is not helpful at all and it could end up being very costly in the long run, or more costly than is necessary.We are told much efficiency has been achieved and that it is not possible to protect services from reductions in 2012.  There are some very serious developments on the way.  The plan states "hospital budgets will drop on average by 4.4% of last year's allocation".  When deficits are taken into consideration, this is closer to 8%.The document indicates how threadbare and unbalanced the system is.  It states the western hospitals are particularly challenged.  Some services, such as speech and language services, are monumentally better in some parts of the country than in others.  Why should one's address determine the quality of the service one receives?We are told the reorganisation of the ambulance service is required, yet we are told there will be no additional funding in 2012 and that our ability to address the newly agreed national targets will be challenging.  The phrase "will be challenging" is seen throughout the document.  "Challenging" means very little or nothing will happen.I have a number of concerns.  The approach involving keeping elderly people at home is good but there is to be a major change in regard to home help for personal and non-personal care.  I refer to home helps who call to people to see whether they are okay.  Has there been an actuarial assessment in the past year of the income that might derive from the fair deal scheme?With regard to mental health, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the sum of â¬35 million is very welcome, but there is a considerable drop in the number of psychiatric nurses owing to the retirement scheme.  It has been said to me several times, and to the Minister of State, that if we took mental illness and suicide as seriously as we take road safety, it would be beneficial.  The Road Safety Authority's statement, which I examined today, refers to a sum of â¬48 million.  The authority has been doing an excellent job in this regard.If we were to consider the effect of a really targeted approach in the area of suicide prevention, we would consider changes in the institutional provision of mental health services, given that the money is not be shoved towards another service.  I am sure there will be good oversight on the part of the Minister of State.The HSE has been allocated â¬40 million each year for ICT projects.  This is a lot of money and it is very welcome but there needs to be institutional architecture if a proper ICT system is to be built.  Without this, computers and systems will not talk to one another and one will end up wasting money and with incredibly wasteful systems such as PPARS.  It is essential that we see the institutional architecture before we commence.  We will have to have oversight.  There are savings that can be made and greater efficiencies to be achieved in our approach but let us not proceed in a haphazard way.  Let us put a health system together that is integrated.There are many points in the plan about which I am very critical but if I were to elaborate on them I would be told off by my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, for taking up her time.  I am sure she will cover some of the other aspects.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	548	This year presents a major challenge for the HSE in that it must do more with less.  There is a massive budget, however, and if it were spent in the most productive way, it would surely produce a high-quality and proper health care system.  The plan states "Designing and delivering services, to ensure high quality safe services for all our patients and clients, is our primary concern".  Central to this is the dignity of the person, irrespective of whether he has a mental illness, disability or physical illness.Some time ago, the Technical Group sponsored a motion on mental health during Private Members' business.  It was one of the most moving debates in my short time here, three years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was present and contributed to the debate.  It demonstrated that mental illness has touched so many people.  We are told one in four will be affected, yet the HSE's budget in this area is only 5.3% of its overall budget.  While I know the Minister of State is doing her best, the figure is very low.We cannot talk about this topic without mentioning Mr. John McCarthy, who passed away recently in Cork.  He had mental health issues.  At the core of everything he did was an emphasis on the dignity and rights of those suffering from mental illness.  He was a phenomenal and tireless campaigner in highlighting the normalcy of madness.  Members will know about Mad Pride Ireland.  I hope that, in memory of Mr. McCarthy, we will get rid of the involuntary use of ECT.The plan states 414 extra posts will be funded from the â¬33 million.  With so many leaving the health service, will the new staff be replacing those who leave or will they be additional staff?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	549	They will be additional.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	550	That is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge the positive incentives, the multidisciplinary mental health service teams, the child and adolescent community teams, the inpatient units and the ensuring of access to quality psychotherapy and counselling services.  People need these and they should not cost a fortune.Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to suicide prevention.  I mentioned previously Oasis Counselling Centre in my constituency, which centre is part of the Deora project.  It is a small well-managed project and allows for direct access for those in difficulty, particularly those presenting with suicidal tendencies and addictions.  Many counselling services will not take on people who are suicidal if they are also experiencing addiction.Another example of best practice is St. Michael's House.  It deals with very vulnerable people.  It has a well-focused budget that is not wasted on administrative expenditure.  Sometimes the micro can inform the macro, rather than the other way around.The staff losses in the public sector will present a major challenge.  The Taoiseach referred this morning to personal choice but this choice was encouraged by financial incentives, resulting in the loss of much expertise and knowledge.  Those with knowledge and experience should have been incentivised to stay.  The scheme ought to have been phased rather than establishing a specific date in February.The risk assessment and impact study should have been carried out before the event and not afterwards.  A voluntary group to which I belong asked us before the budget to examine the consequences of cuts of 5%, 10% and 15%.  We had the answers on how to cope with each of these.  Delivering a high-quality service depends on having a high-quality staff.  The plan refers to "new models of care" as a means of obtaining more from the reduced budgets, but there is detail missing in this regard.I very much welcome the dedicated subhead in the Estimate pertaining to children and families.  The funding for prevention is vital.  It was interesting to read the section on promoting and protecting health.  This relates to health inequality.  There is a clear link between socioeconomic status and health behaviour.  Emphasis must be placed on prevention.  The longer young people stay in school, the better their health options.  We must not cut education expenditure and preclude them from staying in school.The health responses to drugs and addiction have been generally included in the social inclusion and care group but they need to be identified clearly in respect of mental, primary and population health.  This means the clear inclusion of alcohol in the national substance misuse strategy.  The publication of that strategy is necessary because alcohol and other substances have a considerable impact right across the health service.A young man who was suicidal and had an addiction tragically committed suicide when, on becoming 18 years of age, he was transferred from an excellent youth service to an adult unit.  The system has to work for the person, not the other way around.  In my constituency, the fifth person in a family was buried yesterday as a result of drug addiction.  These are the issues we have to tackle.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the HSE service plan for 2012, in particular as it relates to my own constituency, Cork North-West, and the HSE South area.  There is no doubt it is a challenging time to deliver health services, with a reduction of â¬750 million in funding for the HSE for 2012.  However, it is a challenge which, with goodwill, we are capable of rising to.  There will still be in excess of 100,000 staff charged with the responsibility of delivering a package of health services across critical areas such as community care, acute hospitals, mental health services and a host of other areas, including services for people with disabilities.  If we can park the politics and point-scoring and address how we can use the very significant financial resource, we can do more with less funding, particularly if there is a willingness to do so across all areas of service delivery.I want to particularly address the issue of care of the elderly, which is one of the issues that has received much media coverage recently.  As a result, there is much anxiety among that section of the community about, in particular, community nursing units.  I am glad there will be no closure of any of the community nursing units in the HSE South area, notwithstanding much public comment to the contrary from people whom I sometimes wonder might wish there would be closures so they could make more political capital out of it.  I recently attended a meeting in Macroom on the issue of the local district hospital, and I am glad to say it will in 2012 continue to deliver, as it has in the past, an excellent service in the community it serves, as will other hospitals in my constituency such as those at Millstreet, Kanturk and Dunmanway district hospitals.Notwithstanding this, there are critical issues we need to address.  The fundamental issue is that it is cheaper for the State to buy beds in private nursing homes than it is to fund them under the current regime in its own hospitals.  Interestingly, I received an e-mail today from the Impact trade union, as I am sure other Members did.  The Impact e-mail made reference to the fact the Croke Park agreement was delivering and stated that one recent example has been finalised at Our Lady's Hospice, Dublin, where changes to rosters and breaks are expected to deliver annual savings of â¬220,000.  The e-mail stated that the changes will free up 3.5 staff members to work elsewhere in the organisation, leading to an annual â¬175,000 reduction in spending on locums and agency staff, and a further â¬47,000 will be shaved from spending on premium payments which reduce earnings for staff concerned.  Bravo.The real challenge for the HSE management, however, is to get into the trenches.  Why is this information from Impact newsworthy?  It is newsworthy because it is not happening across the sector and is an isolated example.  HSE management will have to get into the trenches in terms of negotiating issues such as overtime rates.  It would be far better not to cut the amount of overtime hours and to instead cut the rates and protect the service.  Premium payments, overtime rates, rosters - if all of these issues were addressed uniformly across the service, developments such as have happened at Our Lady's Hospice in Dublin would guarantee the future of public health nursing units throughout the country.Given their cost base, such units are now under close scrutiny.  I would encourage staff representatives, unions and management at local level to get into the trenches in terms of negotiating the cost base and ensure that these units are viable.  It will not serve the public interest in the long run to place all of our eggs excessively in the private nursing home basket because once we have done that and closed facilities, we will be held to ransom by the private nursing home sector.  It is an issue that needs to be examined.We need to consider the appropriateness of placing people in long-stay facilities, whether private or public, given there are intermediary care options which are less expensive.  The optimum solution for as long as it is practical is to keep people in their own communities.  However, providing people with assisted living is capable of providing a far more cost-effective option to the State as opposed to inappropriately placing them in either community nursing homes or private-run nursing homes at greater expense to the State.There is a challenge ahead in terms of meeting the reduced budget but it does not necessarily have to mean a straight line reduction in services across the board.  It is a challenging time.  I urge all sides, in particular union representatives and management, to get into the trenches in terms of ensuring that Croke Park delivers.  Otherwise, there will be very harsh consequences for consumers of services as well as for those working in the service.

The 24-hour accident and emergency service is now provided at Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, and a 24-hour service is no longer provided at Ennis and Nenagh hospitals.  This was part of the reconfiguration process that commenced in 2009 and brought a large extra number of people through the doors of the accident and emergency unit at Limerick regional hospital.  At the time, the money did not follow the patient and extra work was being carried out by the accident and emergency unit in Limerick.Relative to other regions, the mid-west has not fared well, which is an issue I have raised consistently in recent times.  I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Reilly, appointed a special delivery unit specifically to deal with Limerick regional hospital and allocated specific funding of â¬250,000 towards the end of last year.  I further welcome the fact Ms Ann Doherty has been appointed by the HSE and the Minister as manager of the Mid-West Hospital Network, which effectively covers Limerick regional, Ennis and Nenagh hospitals.  This shows the mid-west is getting the attention it deserves.One of the consequences of the early retirement scheme for public servants is that people will be leaving the system by the end of February.  We note media reports that 47 midwives out of a complement of 200 at Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital have indicated they will be availing of the retirement scheme.  While we do not know the specific figures, that is the indication.  This means over 20% of midwives in the hospital are leaving, which is a worry.  Some 5,200 babies are born there every year and 6,000 women avail of maternity services.  I note the Minister, Deputy Howlin's commitment that the issue of a lack of staff resulting from the retirement package will be given priority.I ask the Minister to give top priority to the maternity hospital in Limerick.  We are all parents.  My four children were born at Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital, which provides excellent care and has terrific staff at both consultant and nursing-midwife level.  I pay tribute to the work they do.  This issue has been flagged early enough that it can be addressed by the Minister and the HSE, so we can have a sufficient compliment of midwives to ensure services are delivered.On the overall issue of funding for the mid-west, when reconfiguration happened in 2009, the region was supposed to get extra funding for services at Limerick regional hospital but sufficient funding was not delivered.  I am aware we live in difficult times.  However, the mid-west and Limerick are entitled to fair consideration.  Relative to other regions in the country, we have fared badly.  I worry that the region will be penalised for making savings.  Rewards should be given for efficiencies.  Efficiencies have been driven in the mid west and Limerick over the past six months, if not longer.I got a commitment from both the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the head of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, that a review would be carried out in respect of funding for the mid west and I understand this is currently underway.  As a Deputy for Limerick city, it is my view that we are entitled to our fair share relative to other regions in the country.  We are looking for no more, no less.  This is something I will continue to highlight.Much great work has been done by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as they look to reforming the health service.  Limerick has undergone rapid change in the recent period and we must ensure we have sufficient funding and personnel.  That last is clearly given emphasis by the 47 midwives who are leaving by the end of February under the early retirement package in the public sector.  I want a commitment to ensure there will be a sufficient complement of midwives at Limerick Regional Hospital on the Ennis Road, starting in early March.  That is critical.

It is disappointing that only at this stage, on 1 February of the year covered by the plan, are we debating and discussing this service plan.If we look at how the plan is drawn up, we see that following the budget each year, including this year, the HSE has three weeks with which to furnish a proposed service plan to the Minister for Health.  After that the Minister has three weeks to accept and approve that plan.  I do not find this a reasonable or sensible way to run a health service, when only in the month of January does the HSE sit down with the Minister for Health for his approval of its service plan for that very year.There was the charade in the early part of January when the Minister referred back to the HSE the draft service plan it had provided to him, stating he was unhappy with it.  This is the same Minister for Health who abolished the HSE board shortly after taking up power.  He told us he was taking charge and things would be very different under him.  We had the spin of the Minister sending the plan back to the HSE.  As one journalist pointed out, very appropriately, it was like sending a letter to oneself to complain about oneself.  It was no more than that.This service plan would be better described as a service reaction, a HSE service reaction to the budget it was given in December when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, outlined exactly what would be available for services for the coming year.  Rather than bringing in the budget and sending it to the HSE asking it to outline what it will do with it, a much more appropriate way would be to liaise and link closely with the HSE.  I would expect that in the future - I expected it this year.  It should not be so difficult, considering the Minister is not only the Minister for Health but has also taken over the running of the HSE board.  He could then tease through with the HSE exactly which services can be delivered in the year ahead alongside the particular budget lines given by the Minister for Finance.Instead the budget is made and the figure given to the HSE which is then expected to come back and say what it can do with the money.  This is very similar to what we have seen in the approach to redundancies, for which the deadline closed yesterday.  Instead of indicating clearly what was being sought, which Departments might be exempt and which areas of the service might manage with fewer staff, there was an across the board opportunity for anybody who wished to retire, regardless of whether the HSE or the Minister believed they were needed.  The only exemption given so far was to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, yesterday.  He has been kept on.  That is not the way to reform but at least it is consistent with the way we have seen this service plan being drawn up and implemented in the past year.What have we seen in this plan?  We have seen â¬750 million cut from the health budget this year and 3,300 staff due to leave the HSE during the course of this year, on top of the staff who left last year.  In 2012, hospital budgets will drop on average by 4.4% from last year's allocation.  This will require an expenditure reduction of 7.8% in many hospitals where overruns are being taken from the previous year.  The Minister states he expects activity levels to fall by 6% as a result while the HSE believes it can keep the figure down to 3% by reordering the way it provides service.  Even so, we are talking about a 3% activity drop which means less service being provided and fewer patients being treated.  An activity drop means more patients waiting longer for treatments they eventually will have to have but before which they must endure, in many cases carrying their illnesses and pains around with them while they wait for their treatment.I had direct experience in my own county with the Minister as to how this measure will impact.  Letterkenny General Hospital, which serves the wider Donegal area, is calculated by the HSE to be the second most efficient hospital in the country.  Nonetheless its budget has been pared back.  It is in a unique position in that 90% of the treatments it carries out are non-elective.  In other words they have to be done and the hospital does not have discretion to decide on them.  As the budget is increasingly pared back those treatments for which one might say there is discretion, such as hip replacements, orthopaedic care, outpatient appointments, are knocked back further and the patients concerned must wait longer.In the past year we have seen, as each Deputy in this Parliament will have seen, that many patients in that category are now waiting longer than ever.  Since the National Treatment Purchase Fund was done away with, patients who, until then, would have been able after three months to access that fund and have their treatments carried out, are now, in many cases, waiting more than a year.  The Minister tells us he does not want anybody to have to wait longer than nine months.  That nine months is three times longer than patients had to wait when the NTPF was available.  I have no doubt that other Members will have had the same experience as I have, seeing strapped families having to come together to purchase private treatment for a parent or a grandparent who simply cannot wait any longer to have it done.The budget will also affect community hospitals.  Although the Minister told us at the end of last year that he did not want to see any community hospitals closed, shortly afterwards the first began to close.  This year up to 900 beds will be taken out of community hospitals.  As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out earlier, patient care will naturally cost more when beds are taken out of a hospital.  Overheads will be similar but the number of patients is reduced.  That is then used as a rationale for arguing it is cheaper to provide this service in private hospitals leading to the shutting of the community hospital entirely.  It makes no sense to close any more beds in community hospitals.  The Minister needs to revisit his decision in that regard.Budgetary cuts are inevitable in our current economic environment.  However, health and education must have first priority in protection from cuts.  Will the Minister show us more of the evidence of how he is going to reform the health service?  So far, all we have seen are longer waiting lists and hospital beds closed.  Instead of everyone receiving universal health insurance, as the Minister claimed when he took office, fewer people have private health insurance now resulting in more pressure coming on to the public health system.  I cannot support the health service plan 2012 and am disappointed with the results in health service reform so far.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Health Service Executive's national service plan 2012.  I support Deputy O'Donnell's call for the need for a fair share of funding for HSE mid west, particularly when one considers the savings the agency made in the region over the past 12 months.This is a challenging time for everyone working in the HSE, health service users, patients and their families.  This plan has been laid out against the background of up to 3,500 impending retirements from the health services when it is anticipated 7,700 public servants will avail of the overall retirement scheme.  However, it is important to remember between 5,000 and 6,000 health services staff retire in a normal year and that the majority of those leaving by the end of this month are within 12 to 18 months of their normal retirement.Listening to Fianna FÃ¡il Members, one would believe the introduction of the incentivised retirement and this scheme came as a surprise to them.  It was during their watch in government that the moratorium on recruitment was introduced in the first place.  It was the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, who introduced the voluntary redundancy and retirement scheme in the HSE which, at the same time, was aimed at reducing the number employed in the public sector from 2011 onwards.No Member will dispute the review of pension arrangements for serving public service staff poses challenges for the HSE.  It does, however, provide an opportunity for real public sector reform.  While it is difficult to confirm the final figures given that each employee has up to the last day of February to change his or her mind, the HSE has a clearer picture of where to plug the gaps in services through either personnel redeployment, savings efficiencies in other areas and limited targeted recruitment.Despite a reduction of â¬750 million, funding is still significant even in these difficult and challenging times with the health budget this year standing at â¬13.3 billion.  As the Minister for Health rightly said earlier, reform is no longer just an option, it is an essential requirement for all involved in health service provision.  The Minister is a reforming one.  Being a medical practitioner he knows the health system inside out.  Already, in his short time in office, he has achieved much with the introduction of the special delivery unit.  The statistics prove this.  The number of people on emergency department trolleys at 8 a.m. for the first 16 days of January 2012 stood at 5,046 when it was 6,893 during the same time in 2011, a reduction of 27%.  The Government is driving health service reform.Finding new innovative ways of delivering our health services is essential in minimising the impact on reduction in resources for the patient.  The HSE is capable of adapting to the changed economic environment.  Today, I was pleased to be informed that following the review of the long-stay nursing homes in the mid-west region, no nursing homes will close in County Clare.  There was much scaremongering by some Opposition Members on this matter.  I am happy to reassure the patients, their families and the staff of Regina House, Kilrush, St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis as well as Raheen Community Hospital in Tuamgraney and Ennistymon Community Hospital that their doors will not be closing.  I pay tribute to the management and staff in the non-acute section of the HSE for making this possible even with a reduced budget.  It was confirmed to me this evening by the HSE and the Minister's office that there would also be no bed closures.  We must, however, remember no further bed closures will depend on staff leaving the health service and changes to sick leave arrangements as well as other work arrangements.I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, for his support on this matter.  I had lobbied both him and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on this on many occasions.  I know their preference is to see as many old people to live in their own communities.  That is, however, not always possible.I welcome the additional provision of â¬35 million for mental health services in this year's plan.  This is important as it is estimated that over 300,000 people suffer from depression, a startling figure.  The development of specialist day-care centres can play a pivotal role in reducing the need for long-stay beds in acute psychiatric services.More than 4,000 people are identified with dementia every year and it is reckoned by 2040 it will affect up to 147,000 people.  Many of these patients are cared for by their families and friends at home but also they can avail of day-care services.  As well as the outstanding social interaction value the centres provide, it is a source of comfort for families to know their loved ones are looked after in a safe environment for several hours during the day.  I hope more of these facilities will be built in our communities because they have a valuable role in the development of care for the elderly allowing them to live in their own homes for longer, which is what most people want to be in a position to do.Last Monday I spoke at the launch of the new Sikorsky S-92 helicopter at Shannon Airport.  The helicopter's primary role will be in search and rescue operations along the west coast and it will be a great asset to the Coast Guard's helicopter rescue crews.  It is capable of operating in all weather conditions and its auxiliary fuel tanks allow it to travel extended distances.  However, it is also ideal for providing the HSE with air ambulance services.  The crew members, most of whom are trained paramedics, told me they will be able to travel from Shannon Airport to parts of west County Clare, such as Kilbaha and Carrigaholt, in 20 minutes.  That will help people in disadvantaged areas.  I understand negotiations are ongoing between the HSE and the Coast Guard and I hope the air ambulance service will be up and running by July, which is welcome news for people who live in rural, isolated parts of my constituency and tourists who visit the county during the summer.  The air ambulance service will be assisted by advanced paramedics on the ground, about whom I hear positive reports.  I acknowledge the work they do in covering the county on a 24/7 basis.I have insufficient time to speak about the testing for type two diabetes which the HSE is rolling out.  We are living in unprecedented times and we face major challenges with our reduced health budgets.  Ministers have to cut their cloth by their measure.  A significant number of experienced staff will retire next month but the staff remaining in the HSE are well trained professionals and while the departure of their colleagues will pose a challenge, they can reduce the impact on front line services by working together.

It is impossible to address the financial constraints within which this service plan was drawn up without mentioning the Government's economic policy.  At least â¬750 million will come out of the HSE's budget this year, following two years in which a total of â¬1.75 billion was removed.  Staff levels are down by over 8,700 since 2007, while demand on services continues to grow.  This is happening even as the Government willingly pumps billions of euro into the cavernous remains of Anglo Irish Bank in an attempt to keep international onlookers satisfied that we can behave ourselves.  We went mad all right, but just for a while.  We hope and pray that a European recovery will raise all boats.  It is subservient economics 101 and the population at large suffers.The dance that took place to get us to this point is telling.  Starting with the Minister's kite flying in advance of the budget, the rejection of the earlier version of this document and the early new year media intervention, it looked and sounded like damage limitation.  The details of the plan indicate why damage limitation might be an appropriate course.  It is a plan that is difficult to accept and even more difficult to believe.  It contains a litany of ambitious targets, many of which are to be welcomed, such as those relating to efficiencies and performance.  However, other targets will have a detrimental effect on the quality of life of thousands.  In a year that will see â¬750 million taken out of the system, equating in some instances to a 7% or 8% cut, I wonder how the Minister, his Department and the HSE expect to achieve these targets.  Sound bites about working faster, harder or better will not be enough.The headline issues arising from this plan have been highlighted.  It is clear that the heart will be torn from our public nursing homes.  The plan states:The challenges associated with the continued provision of residential care in public facilities as a result of staff reductions and the National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland will lead to a continued reduction in the numbers of public beds in 2011.  In the absence of reform, this would increase the cost of caring for older people within the public system, undermine the viability of public community nursing units, and reduce the overall number of older persons that can be supported within the budget available for NHSS.  It is anticipated that a minimum of 555 residential beds will close in the course of year.The figure could be as high as 1,000 beds, however.We have already seen the ball starting to roll in Laois, Athlone and Dublin, to name but a few areas.  In my area of Cork East, facilities and beds are under threat in Youghal and Fermoy.  Youghal Community Hospital is in danger of losing eight beds, with the result that vulnerable elderly people and their families are left at their wits end.  Home help hours are being cut at the same time as the State seems to be abandoning its duty of care.  The work carried out in our local public nursing homes by carers and community nurses is essential.  This national service plan will see a further erosion of this service.Likewise, an aspect of the health service which has gained prominence in my constituency and, indeed, in the entire Munster area over the past 12 months is the so-called reorganisation of pre-emergency care.  Ambulance response times for 2011 were below target across the board yet the HSE somehow expects to improve the system by redeploying the same staff over longer periods in less sophisticated vehicles.  Rural areas are up in arms.  Youghal has been fighting for the retention of its ambulance service in the face of proposed downgrades.  The plan as outlined will cost lives and needs to be resisted.  I commend the work of the Save Youghal Ambulance Committee in this regard.The percentage of clinical status one echo incidents responded to by first responder vehicles in eight minutes or less was 49% last year, compared to a target of 75%.  This year's target of 75% seems to be arbitrary.  A mere 26% of delta cases were responded to in the same period.  It appears the target figures were plucked out of the air with little or no consideration for what the service means to people.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I thank Deputy McLellan for facilitating me in contributing to this important debate.  The health service plan leaves no question that taking â¬750 million from the HSE's budget will have a devastating impact on our health service.We have choices on meeting our international targets while at the same time protecting health and education.  Abolishing property based tax loopholes would yield an additional â¬450 million this year and increasing capital gains and acquisitions taxes to 40% would yield approximately â¬250 million.  These are political choices the Minister for Finance could have made to provide extra money for health services.  I regret that, despite the advice of many groups and economists, those alternatives were not taken.At the end of this month, 1,739 nurses will leave the public system.  This will inevitably result in further bed closures.  More than 2,000 beds have already been closed across the country.  Further bed closures will have a knock on effect on waiting lists.  People will not be diagnosed or given access to treatment as quickly as they need, resulting in more serious health outcomes and greater costs for the Exchequer in the long term.  As I have said in previous debates, cuts bluntly implemented do not produce savings.  We need to recognise that the agenda of austerity is not working and we need to address that fundamental problem.  Savaging our health services will certainly not deal with unemployment or protect our economy in the future.The budget cut â¬85 million from hospitals, which will have a serious impact.  A saving of â¬12 million comes from a reduction in the pay at entry level for student nurses, which is a crude attack on young women and men coming into public service to dedicate their lives to public health.  The moratorium on public sector recruitment means that speech and language therapists and other specialists cannot be recruited.  We are losing five public health nurses at the end of this month.  The key point is that it is not an economically sensible way to approach this.  Despite what the plan states, many of these hours, for example in the nursing sector, will be made up by agency staff.  Where is the saving in that?In my hand I have the draft cost-containment plan for Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, which serves approximately 300,000 people.  The plan was produced as a consequence of the cuts made by the HSE and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  It refers to bed closures, reviewing access to different units and procedures in the hospital and closing day wards.  However, section 60 of the report on the emergency department is blank.  Three months ago the Minister gave a commitment that the accident and emergency department would be secure and would remain open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Why does the plan make no mention of it?  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, should give a commitment that the accident and emergency department will remain open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  If it does not remain so, the people of Dublin West and the other communities the hospital serves will not accept it and there will be a massive campaign of resistance.  We must protect our accident and emergency departments and not blame public servants who are taking massive cuts.  There is an agenda among some parties - some in Fine Gael have said it publicly - to attack the Croke Park agreement.  That does not represent the future for our health service or our economy.  We must rethink, re-engage and ask those who have most to pay most.  That is why I do not agree with the plan that has been put before us today.

Even in the decade I have been in politics, the problems with the use of computers and IT in the health service have not been addressed.  We still have a hopeless implementation policy for the use of information technology in the hospital sector.  For instance, I cannot get blood test results via broadband, but must continue to get them via an ISDN line because the HSE does not want to use broadband to transfer information from the laboratories to doctors' surgeries.  I cannot send an e-mail to hospital consultants but must send faxes or letters.  These would be considered ridiculous by most businesses, but that is what is happening.There are continual problems with the care of the elderly and how we will address it in the future.  That was an issue a decade ago and remains an issue.  In these more difficult times, it requires us to be very conscious of what we are doing because we need to look after our elderly people who can no longer look after themselves.  Access to hospital services is still poor and is inconsistent across the country.  People in the south east wait four years to see an orthopaedic surgeon and three years to see an ear, nose and throat surgeon.  However, patients in other parts of the country will wait longer for different types of services, for example speech and language services.  If we could not sort out these problems when we called ourselves the richest nation in the world, we will certainly have trouble sorting them out now that we are in such difficult financial times.Access to primary care and mental health services will also be a problem.  As Deputy Browne is aware, St. Senan's Hospital, which was a Victorian institution, was closed as we are trying to move services for people with mental health problems into the community.  There is a need to destigmatise people with mental health problems and treat them as normal members of the community who should not feel they should be locked up when getting treatment for those problems.  All health care is moving away from the acute hospital setting and mental health should do so also.I know that Fianna FÃ¡il's Private Members' motion tonight concerns small schools.  A large number of people in the public sector undoubtedly feel that an attack is being made on them, but that is not the case.  There is an agreement with the public sector unions to implement the Croke Park agreement.  There is a need to implement that agreement in order to protect services in the future and we must implement it quickly.  There is no Croke Park agreement for the service users, students, patients or pensioners.  It is very important that all public servants, including doctors, nurses, teachers and politicians, work together to ensure the service users we are looking after get the best possible service.  That is the point some members of my party are making about the Croke Park agreement.  It is not about getting rid of it and having strife with people who work in the public sector which would be pointless.  It is about implementing the Croke Park agreement in order to deliver the best possible service we can in the worst financial times the country has ever experienced.  Everybody acknowledges that public sector workers have taken pay cuts of 15% to 25%, which is a significant hit in households dependent on the income that derives from the State.There is urgent need to make changes and we need to review everything.  Hospital theatres lie empty at night and some hospital consultants are not actually working.  We are paying those consultants â¬160,000 a year and they will openly admit they have no work to do because they have no access to theatres.  In recent years we made major changes to how hospitals are administered and run.  We may need to review some of those changes to see if they remain fit for purpose.  Many of those changes were made because we were pouring money into the health services without any necessary regard to how that money was being spent.  Undoubtedly a significant portion of that money was poorly spent.  We structured our health services in a way that may not work well in these more difficult times.  We meet people all the time who know we can make our health, educational and other public services work better.  That spirit of co-operation will remain, but we need to get down to working on this issue, which is far too important for the people involved.I see great potential in what the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, proposes.  He talks about the money following the patient.  Many of those who contributed to this debate spoke about specific concerns in their areas.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  I visited that area six years ago when there were plans to close the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  At the time it was quite obvious that the Mid-Western Regional Hospital would have problems dealing with this extra workload.  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that hospital has below the national average number of doctors, nurses and allied health-care professionals considering the throughput in the hospital, and it was clearly going to run into problems.  This happens in a number of hospitals.  Many people might not understand that hospitals such as the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital have similar workloads to St. Vincent's University Hospital, which has 1,200 more staff than either of those regional hospitals.The staff complement in Waterford Regional Hospital is 2,700, representing a significant difference for these hospitals.  One cannot simply compare these hospitals in an absolute sense because St. Vincent's University Hospital carries out a good deal of specialised work not carried out in the other two hospitals.  However, by and large, much of the work done in all three hospitals is similar.  These are the issues the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is considering now.  He is trying to find efficiencies in the health service at present.There is a need to make other changes for the future.  There is a need to ensure that we focus on health promotion, health prevention and health screening.  We must try to catch disease before it gets to people.  Previously we used to discuss high blood pressure and diabetes.  However, these diseases are now being overtaken by a condition called metabolic disease.  This is made up of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol.  Vast numbers of the population are affected by all of these illnesses at the same time.  Vast health resources will be required in future to look after patients and we must plan for the explosion that will occur in this country in the coming decade or 15 years.  Otherwise, there will be an even greater crisis in our heath service than that which we perceive at the moment.  There are problems now and there will be problems in future.  Unfortunately, because of the financial crisis we are making significant cuts and these will hit front line services.  There will be reductions but I believe that we have a great opportunity to change things.  It will not be perfect.Deputy Browne will remember his former party colleague, Charlie McCreevy, who stated that he would not put any more money into health because putting money into health was like pouring money down a black hole.  That is not correct but the point he was making was that health services will consume as much money as one wishes to put into it.  In these limited times we must try to get the best possible outcomes for the money we are putting into the health services and we continue to put a significant amount of money into health.I wish to make some remarks about private health insurance.  The genesis of the problems with private health insurance today dates back to meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in 2005 and the position of the then Minister, Mary Harney, on risk equalisation and the way in which the structure of community rating was set up in the country.  The then Minister, Mary Harney, chose to believe there was no problem.  No more than she ever expected that we would be in the position we are in today, the genesis of many of the problems we face in private health insurance now date back to that time when we did not deal properly with the private health industry and the provision of these services to people.Many people believe that there is no accountability when a patient goes to hospital with VHI cover.  The bill is simply sent to the VHI.  We do not know what people are being charged for or how much they are being charged.  I understand the receipt one receives from the VHI is considered unacceptable to the auditors in the European Union because it does not provide the clarity required.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the health service plan 2012.  The plan, if one could call it that, proposes to reduce the overall health spend by â¬750 million.  This leaves â¬14 billion to be spent on the health services during 2012.  One would expect â¬14 billion to be sufficient to provide an adequate health service for the people.  However, as is the case with any plan from the HSE, the cuts begin with the most vulnerable and the least well-off in our society.  The consultants, doctors and senior management at the top are usually left to one side and they are not obliged to take the necessary reductions to bring about savings.  Deputy Twomey referred to efficiencies.  Surely efficiencies should start with the leaders in the HSE.  There are enough managers throughout the country to devise a practical plan.The Minister has okayed the plan before us this week.  At first he sent it back to the HSE but he approved the plan eventually.  This was a window-dressing exercise by the Minister to allow him to wash his hands of the plan.  We are all aware that the Department of Health and the HSE have worked hand-in-hand to draw up a plan for the health service in the future.Let us consider the implications of the plan in my area in the south east.  Leaks have come from Waterford Regional Hospital in recent weeks.  We will see the closure of three of its eight operating theatres.  Elective procedures are set to be hit first.  Waiting lists for specialist surgery will lengthen and there will be some restrictions in respect of specialist drugs as well.  Let us consider the case of Wexford General Hospital.  It is difficult to get information about Wexford General Hospital.  However, I have done some investigative work in the past week involving staff within the hospital.  They have informed me that approximately 55 staff will be lost to the hospital because of redundancies, retirements and people leaving the service.  The medical admissions unit will close at weekends, from Friday evening to Monday morning, orderly security will be cut and some wards will be closed at night time.  This will have a devastating effect on the hospital.The two major hospitals in the south east will suffer from the severe reductions in the services available to the general public.  Before he concludes the debate, the Minister should explain fully the reductions that will come about because of the HSE plan on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  I understand there will be a reduction of â¬1 million in the ambulance service budget in the HSE south region.  This will seriously affect the ambulance service in the south east region, which both Deputy Twomey and myself represent.I refer to the ongoing medical card debacle.  I have before me a file containing 140 medical card queries from the people of my county, some of which date back to last August when those involved first applied for a medical card.  These people have not yet received a medical card.  There are delaying tactics although I do not suggest the Minister is deliberately delaying the issuing of medical cards.  The centralising of the issuing of medical cards took place on our watch.  Many backbench Fianna FÃ¡il people objected at the time to the centralisation of the medical card system because when it was operated on a county-by-county basis, people were able to get a medical card reasonably quickly and if there was a problem they were able to go to the local medical card office and sort out the problem.  Now one must telephone the medical card office in Dublin.  The staff there are not to blame - they are doing their best - but there is a difficulty because of the vast number of medical card applications which they must process in one office in Dublin.  It is scandalous that people have been waiting since last August or September for their medical cards.I realise Deputy Twomey and other doctors have been trying to provide this service in the hope that people will eventually get their medical cards but doctors are getting fed up of this as well.  In addition, chemists are becoming fed up of supplying the drugs in the hope that people might get a medical card at some stage in future.  It is not good enough for the Minister to have stated in the House last week that there is a 15-day turnaround for the issuing of medical cards.  This is not the case. Certainly, it is not the case in my county and I doubt whether it is the case in any other county.  There may be a scarcity of staff but it is important that staff are put into the medical card offices in Dublin to clear the backlog and to ensure that people who deserve medical cards get them quickly and on time.There are cases of people suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses and they are being denied the medical card which would allow them to get the drugs they require.  We know of cases where people are not going to the doctor although they are seriously ill because they do not have the medical card to cover the cost of the visit or the cost of the drugs required to treat the illness.  Doctors and chemists in my county have done their best up to now but they are becoming increasingly annoyed with the ongoing delays.  In some cases, they believe it is a cynical exercise to slow down the issuing of medical cards and to reduce the costs associated with them.  I call on Deputy Twomey to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, increases the number of staff making decisions on and working on the issuing of medical cards.

Although I have nothing personal against the people who put forward the motion, one would have to say they must have a neck as thick as the proverbial whatever to move it.  In fairness, it is an excellent issue to raise, because something needs to be done about the situation.Having listened to the Minister yesterday, it seems he does not intend under any circumstance to turn on this issue.  We will see about that.  All he should do is look at the number of people who have gathered outside the gate of this House tonight, with only 48 hours notice, to understand the importance of this issue for rural Ireland.  He says he does not like the rural urban divide or to see the divisions being created by certain people.  The biggest offender in this regard is the Minister himself.  What he is doing to rural Ireland with his proposals demonstrates a complete bias against people in rural Ireland, nothing else.  The Minister let out his true feelings yesterday on the future he sees for rural Ireland.  He told us the worldwide trend is for people to move from rural to urban areas.  Perhaps that is true, but the Minister should take a closer look at the reason for that.If local train stations and hospitals are closed, if local schools are ruined, if people are prevented from cutting turf and if their local public transport system is destroyed, one can only expect that people will be forced to move from rural areas.  They have no choice about it.The Minister manipulated pupil-teacher ratios here yesterday.  Everyone knows how he manipulated them to indicate that rural Ireland was getting a better deal than anywhere else.  Nobody believes that.  If we are to protect the future of rural Ireland and do not want a 100% exodus towards urban Ireland, instead of looking at the low numbers in the classrooms and asking why these small classes deserve so many teachers, we should turn the argument on its head and examine why there are so few people living in rural Ireland.  We should solve that problem and then the Minister will not be able to stand up and ask how a school can be viable with such low numbers of pupils.The notion that people want to leave rural Ireland is incorrect.  I said on my first day in the DÃ¡il that 19 out of the 20 people in my house had to emigrate.  They left rural Ireland, but not because they wanted to.  Some of them are now in Dublin and many of my friends are now in Dublin, Galway and elsewhere, but not one of these people wanted to leave rural Ireland.  The reason they left is that Government after Government has been without a plan for rural Ireland.  As a result, people had no choice but to leave it.  I do not want to leave rural Ireland.  Nobody wants to leave.  If the problem is there are not enough pupils then we need to ensure there are enough pupils.What sickened me most yesterday was the Minister's attitude to people who may not be as smart as he is.  In fairness, he admitted he was not very quick off the mark when the Labour Party got back into Government.  However, stating that if we were going to act like slow learners, he would have to put it up on the board a few times is not only unbecoming of a Minister for Education but is a resigning offence.  Is the Minister telling us that he is intolerant of people who need to be told something twice or three times because, perhaps, they do not have a similar IQ level to him?  Is he saying these people should not be tolerated?  It is a bit low for a Minister for Education to goad the Opposition and suggest they are slow learners and, therefore, are somehow not right or good enough to be treated well.  It is clear the Minister believes this.  The fact he is taking help out of the classroom for, as he calls them, "slow learners", proves that.The Minister is wrong on this.  Believe me, we will make him change his mind.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Clearly, many decisions are being made on the basis of how numbers and money add up.  Unfortunately, life is not like that and there are many other factors to consider.  Although it may seem rational to make these cuts on the basis of numbers and money, the impact these cuts will have on the community reduce the merit of what is being done.  We have seen so much of this same thinking applied in Ireland in the past few years that it is frightening.  Some of the first things to go from rural areas were the small shops, when the big shops were allowed swallow them up and they received no protection.  Small pubs are disappearing and now we are closing post offices, Garda stations and nursing homes and we are likely to be left with a wasteland.There is a need for positive action from the Government in order to preserve the sense of community in the countryside.  Rural areas need help, rather than the sort of treatment they have been receiving.  Not alone that, many of our small schools cater for minorities.  We have, for example, 200 Protestant schools in this country.  We like to pretend that we look after minorities well.  I met people from the Old Borough national school in Swords outside the House today.  I am sure that for these people to come from these schools to protest here disrupts their lives, but the Government needs to take on board how important these issues are to them and how they feel about how their children are being treated.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	567	In a recent statement to the DÃ¡il the Minister stated that between 60,000 to 70,000 additional pupils would attend primary schools over the next five years.  Due to the fact that our small primary schools will benefit on a pro rata basis from these numbers, I believe the strategy outlined in the budget is badly thought out.  No proper cost-benefit analysis has been done and the proposals will create a huge urban-rural imbalance in the country.  Millions of euro have been invested in our smaller schools over recent years for structural improvements, additional classrooms and exterior facilities.  I ask the Minister to rethink seriously proposed policy due to the disastrous detrimental effect the current proposals will have on rural communities.  These communities are already under siege due to lost services and infrastructure over recent years and the remaining small shops, post offices and Garda stations are diminishing monthly.Now, in the past few weeks our smaller primary schools have come under serious threat.  This is uncalled for.  We have some control in this regard unlike other matters that are beyond the control of Government.  The fate of these schools is in our hands.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	569	In terms of the overall budget, the savings to be made on this are minuscule.  I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board, as he has done with the DEIS schools, so as to provide some sort of equality and equity to rural Ireland.Recently, we attended a meeting on the Gaeltacht region in west Kerry and I am sure the issues raised affect all of the western seaboard schools, the last custodians of our heritage and our language.  Irish is a minority language, but it is well respected throughout Europe and we should not forget that.  The comprehensive linguistic study of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht in 2007 recognised that category A areas, the strongest category Gaeltacht areas, have only 20 years to maintain the Irish language as their first language unless proper structures are put in place.  If we do not retain all the small schools in the Gaeltacht and other rural areas, we are putting the final nail in that coffin.

What is happening here is a thundering disgrace.  I want to support the motion in the strongest way possible tonight.  The Minister is a disgrace.  The people who will back him tonight are a disgrace if they do not support this motion.  I am asking the people who are thinking of voting for this tonight to vote for the children of Ireland, to vote for our rural schools, to vote for parents, for the teachers, for the principals, for the people who have worked so hard over the years to build up our small rural schools.  They are the backbone of our society.  They are the backbone of our communities and we do not want to lose them.If the Minister and the people who are thinking of voting for him tonight go ahead with this, it will be one of the worst attacks that was ever made on rural Ireland.  Shame upon them if that is what they do.  This was the Government that had choices to make when it took power.  What choice did it make?  It made a conscious decision to attack the young and vulnerable people of Ireland.  I am sorry to see all the empty seats here.  It is a shame more Deputies are not here to hear this debate.  I am asking the people who are considering voting for the Government tonight, in particular rural TDs, to give up the wishy-washy talk, stand out tonight and vote for this motion.  Vote for the children and think of our schools.  It is bad enough that we are all banjaxed in Ireland today, but I call on Deputies not to banjax our future generations, not to hurt our children and not to sell them down the river.

I listened very carefully to what speakers had to say last night and to what Deputy Healy-Rae had to say this evening, and I find it unbelievable to think that people would have such neck to stand up here after the damage they have done to the country and the huge legacy they have left our children to bear over the coming generations.  Less than a year after the general election, they stand up here and talk about the future plight of the country and what the children of Ireland have to put up with.  It is unbelievable, disingenuous and wrong-----

It is disingenuous and it is wrong, morally and politically wrong.Since I became aware of these changes, as a rural based TD and as someone who attended a rural primary school and who taught in rural primary schools, I have been working to try to bring about changes in the areas that are causing particular difficulty to schools in my constituency and throughout the country.  I have been engaging on a regular basis with both Ministers and their offices to try to bring about meaningful progress on this.  This is something that has not come from the other side of the House.  We have not had any meaningful progress.  We have not had any proper alternatives and proposals.  All we have had is negativity and bashing of the Government.  We have had no solutions.  Being in government is about finding solutions and that is what we are hoping to do.

It is not fair and I want to see it addressed.I also want to see special exemptions in cases where schools are so geographically isolated that amalgamation will never be an option in the future.  I have a school like that in my constituency in Clohane in west Kerry.  It is a very geographically isolated school and its management have made a strong case for not being able to amalgamate with any other school.  There needs to be an exemption in such schools.

We are doing this to provide them with proper health care, jobs, social welfare if they need it and to restore to the young people of this country the economic sovereignty and independence that was removed by virtue of the last Government led by Fianna FÃ¡il, in whose name this motion is tabled, and the self-motivated Independent TDs who supported them in government.There are very difficult choices that every one of our Ministers has to take.

He inherited a crisis and, as he has stated in the House on numerous occasions and Members and the public are well aware, the country is bankrupt.  He has also stated on numerous occasions, including in the Chamber last night, that not one school will close.I value Private Members' motions, even though I am a member of a Government party, because it is important to hold the Government to account.  I am disappointed, however, by the unhelpful and misleading language used in this debate.  Do Deputies care about the damage they are doing to the integrity of the country or the sense of crisis and nervousness they are creating in communities?When I was young my late mother used to say we had to make ends meet as a family.  If businesses do not make ends meet, they will close and if the Government, including the Minister for Education and Skills, does not make ends meet, the current crisis will worsen.  It did not help that a previous Deputy Healy-Rae held previous Governments to ransom for 14 years and contributed to the mess we are in today.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Deputy Michael Healy-Rae should be ashamed to make the comments he made earlier.  I know in my heart and soul that the Minister is committed to and passionate about education.  He will not close schools and will make a contribution while in government that will help restore the country's economic sovereignty.  I am committed to that process, as is everyone present.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	639	This debate has been taking place since the former Minister for Education and Science, Mary Coughlan, commissioned a value for money report and thereby acknowledged the need to review the school system and possibly save money in schools with fewer than 50 pupils.  While the debate has focused on the quality of education and teacher numbers, it also raises the issue of how we secure the savings required under the EU-IMF programme given that 80% of the education budget is tied up in teachers' pay, which is protected by the Croke Park agreement.  This is a major problem.  The savings of such money as required between 2012 and 2014 will be difficult and has clearly given rise to concerns in rural areas about the viability of schools and communities.Since before Christmas, I have visited schools across Connemara to listen to the concerns of parents and teachers.  Schools where the number of teachers is being reduced from four to three under the threshold introduced last year have legitimate concerns.  I met the Minister for Education and Science as part of a small delegation of Fine Gael Party Deputies and asked him to show flexibility and introduce an appeals mechanism for schools whose numbers are close to the threshold required to retain a teacher who would otherwise be lost under the new provisions.  I appeal again to the Minister to introduce such a mechanism.My colleague, Deputy Brendan Griffin, is fighting for small schools in south County Kerry and has been vociferous on this matter in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  For example, he led a debate on a motion on this issue a couple of weeks ago.  The increase in the threshold for qualifying for a fourth teacher from 76 to 83 pupils for Gaeltacht schools is a large step.  We are all on record as asking the Minister to review this measure.  People have asked me at various meetings what I am doing about this issue.  I have highlighted to the Minister the anomalies arising in respect of DEIS rural schools and retrospective nature of the measures and appealed to him to show flexibility.  While I recognise that school amalgamations may proceed, a certain amount of flexibility could be shown.  It is wrong, however, to suggest that schools should never close.  The number of schools has declined from 6,000 at one point to 3,000.  Not all of these closures, if any, took place in the past nine or ten months.  They closed under Governments of all shades.  It is important to recognise that Ireland has changed, while also acknowledging that all communities have a strong attachment to their local schools.We must send a message that the Minister and Government will not close schools as such decisions are a matter for patrons and parents.  In recent years, schools in Connemara have amalgamated.  I am on record as seeking flexibility in this matter and I hope we will receive a positive response before the final decision is made.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	640	A number of people from County Clare are in the Visitors Gallery and AV room.  I pay tribute to them because they travelled to Dublin to show concern about the future of education.  I assure them that every single Deputy on the Government benches shares their concern.  In fairness and notwithstanding the play-acting we have witnessed this evening, every Deputy on the Opposition benches also shares that concern.  Our visitors from east County Clare will be familiar with the following place names: Cloonusker, Coolin Bridge and Cappaghabaun.  These are three townlands in Scariff, my parish, each of which had a national school until the 1970s when they were closed by a Fianna FÃ¡il Minister for Education - he may even have been from County Clare - and replaced by one school in Scariff.  I was in the first junior infants class in the new school.  Each and every child from the three townlands I mentioned continued to receive an education after the schools amalgamated and every teacher in the three schools in question continued to teach in a very good school which I had the privilege to attend after the amalgamation took place.  Similarly, schools in Slieve Anore, Corrakyle, Knockbeha, Gurtavaha and Dooglaun were closed and amalgamated in Flagmount national school.  A similar merger occurred when schools in Killaloe, Tulla, Clonlara and Kilkishen amalgamated.  Despite these mergers, our children continued to receive an education.What the Government is proposing is much more modest than the closure of such a large number of schools.  It is simply increasing the number of pupils required to receive a second teacher post from 12 this year to 14 in 2013, 17 in 2014 and 20 in 2015.  The number of pupils required to receive a third teaching post will increase from 49 this year to 51 next year, 54 in 2014 and 56 in 2015, while the number of pupils required for a fourth teaching post will increase from 81 to 83 in 2013, 85 in 2014 and 86 in 2015.  This is a modest step which, notwithstanding the histrionics we have seen tonight, does not threaten the fabric of rural Ireland or the future of GAA clubs in rural areas.  That threat comes from the economic morass in which we find ourselves.  I do not propose to comment on or play politics with that issue, however.I will reiterate a comment made by the Minister last night.  This debate provided him, as it provides me, with an opportunity to state categorically that this measure is not about closing schools.  As the Minister acknowledged, schools play an important part in our communities, particularly in rural areas.  He has been clear that the measure involves a simple and minor adjustment to pupil-teacher ratios and that small schools will continue to receive preferential ratios - the general pupil-teacher ration is 28:1.  It is open to schools which find they are one, two or three pupils below the threshold to negotiate an amalgamation.  This issue is no more about rural versus urban Ireland than it is about east versus west Clare.

I viewed their projects, their work and their wonderful cÃ©ilÃ­ band in which children played harps and banjos.  The school had the most up-to-date IT smart boards, a wonderful website and was a place of quality learning and teaching.  We are, however, in difficult times.  Some 80% of the annual budget is tied up in the salaries and pensions of  teachers, SNAs and lecturers.  As a nation, we must recognise there is currently a great strain on our public finances.  We must ensure the very valuable but limited resources available to our education system are used in the best possible way.I understand small schools are concerned if numbers drop.  Last night the Minister for Education and Skills outlined the rationale behind raising the pupil-teacher ratio in rural schools.  He also outlined an appeals system where small schools can appeal if they know their pupil enrolment will increase.  I, along with my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, had a two-hour meeting with the Minister last week and this appeals system was discussed.  I am confident we can deliver this appeals system to schools if they are in danger of losing numbers and the following year the projections are that those numbers will increase.  I welcome this confirmation from the Minister that the existing staff appeals-----

#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I am glad to make a contribution to this debate.  I acknowledge the uncertainty and doubt among many parents and children in rural Ireland.  In the past few days, I have been contacted by parents who think their schools will either close or lose teachers in the next few weeks.  There has been some winding up of the issue but it is important that we peel away to find the reality and deal with it in a constructive manner.I thank the parents and teachers who have engaged and put forward very reasoned and reasonable proposals on how this should be dealt with because that allowed those of us on this side of the House to bring those arguments to the Minister last week.  The Minister dealt with the issue of the retirement of teachers of examination classes in secondary school and this can be done in this case also.  What is important, however, is that flexibility is shown in dealing with this issue.  I support anyone on any side of the House when he or she talks about retrospective numbers and how that is dealt with - in other words, the number of pupils last September should not determine the number of teachers next September. There should be a real appeals system and not one where nothing changes regardless of the situation.  That is very important.  I would also say that one size does not fit all.  Amalgamations are not possible in many areas.It is important to deal with the problem in a reasoned and calm fashion.  To a certain extent, it is sometimes difficult to do that when dealing with a very emotive subject.  Just as some parents thought schools would be closed next week, it is important for teachers, parents and pupils to realise this issue will not be won or lost tonight.  There is a long game involved and it is important we get an acceptable solution which will leave rural schools at the heart of our communities for many years to come.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I will begin by quoting a statistic.  In 1924, there were 5,700 schools, 80% of which were one or two-teacher schools.  We debate this very important subject in the middle of the greatest economic crisis with which this country has ever had to deal.  We are relying on our European neighbours to pay our bills.  Some of the indications are that we are heading in the right direction but some difficult decisions have had to be made and difficult decisions will remain to be made to get us back on the right economic track.Some 80% of the Minister's budget, which was approximately â¬8 billion last year, was spent on pay and pensions in that sector.  That leaves approximately â¬1 billion with which to play around.  That really ties the Minister's hands behind his back.  It is very difficult to find savings within that very narrow economic constraint.It is Government policy to support the Croke Park Agreement but it is not policy to support wage militance.  Now is the time for trade unionists to lead and to bring their membership with them and to stop hiding behind children to advance a very narrow avarice objective.  I want to reiterate that point.

#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I want to avoid the political point-scoring that has been going on here this evening and be proactive in the limited time available.  The reduction of teacher numbers in small primary schools involves a loss of dedicated learning support and resource teachers in such schools through a pool basis.  One small three-teacher school in my own Kildare South constituency is currently allowed to combine its general allocation model of learning support hours with NCSE resource hours to give it a full-time staff member on the premises for a 25-hour week.  The change will see it lose the full-time teacher to a panel, but two part-time people will be employed to do the same work shared between other schools.  I can see that it might make sense in some areas, but it will involve additional mileage and travel expenses.  It will mean, however, that such teachers will not be in the classroom all the time, which is where they are needed.This decision should be taken in light of the value for money review.  I would like to see the facts and figures showing that this change will save money or, at the very least, not increase costs.  Where are the savings to be made?  The Minister should examine this proposal to ensure that it is practical and of value when it comes through.I congratulate the Minister for finding savings of â¬80 million in an extremely difficult budgetary situation.  It is a major achievement not to have touched the overall pupil-teacher ratio  If that had been touched that is what tonight's debate would be about because it would have had a huge impact all over the country.  While other aspects have arisen, we should not lose sight of that achievement.  The Department and the Minister are facing huge difficulties.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Minister to proactively discuss such issues when they arise.  The issue should not be used as a political football, as has been the case in some instances tonight.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	693	There is a certain inevitability that debates in Private Members' time can go off at a tangent.  It is important, however, to return to the real issues involved.  They are encapsulated in the motion moved by our party's education spokesmen, Deputy Brendan Smith, as follows:That DÃ¡il Ãireann:â condemns the Government for introducing changes to the staffing schedules in 1, 2, 3 and 4 teacher schools in Budget 2012;â objects to this policy decision which unfairly targets schools with less than 86 pupils and which will result in a loss of 250 posts and an increase in the pupil/teacher ratio between now and 2013;â further objects to the Government's covert approach to amalgamation and closure of 1, 2, 3 and 4 teacher schools;â condemns the severe impact this will have on gaelscoileanna, scoileanna Gaeltachta and minority faith schools in particular;â further condemns the Government decision to apply the new staffing schedule based on 2011 enrolment figures; andâ recognises that small schools are at the heart of communities.Some 47% of the 3,200 primary schools in the State have five teachers or less.  This year, small schools will be facing the loss of 100 posts, while in 2013 this figure will rise to 250, which is unacceptable.  The proposal does not take account of the geography and catchment area of many schools, particularly in the west, as well as in my own constituency of Louth and elsewhere around the country.This proposal will lead to forced amalgamations and closures.  Research has shown that children who attend smaller schools excel in their social and general emotional development.  There is much greater parental and community involvement in social activity and the general maintenance of school buildings.  Over the last 15 years, there has been a huge investment by the Department of Education in many of the schools we are talking about in this debate.  It would seem to be a significant waste of money to proceed with the Government's proposal.  There are many examples of schools that were completed in recent years which may well face closure as a result of this proposal.There will be a serious and disproportionate impact on minority faith schools, such as those of the Church of Ireland.  I am sure there is one in virtually every constituency.  They will be seriously and adversely affected by the proposal before us.  If some of those schools are forced to amalgamate or close, where will their ethos be upheld?  The Minister for Education and Skills has placed considerable emphasis on the ethos of our schools, but it will clearly suffer.  Has the Department carried out an impact analysis of this proposal?  If so, will it be made available to Members of this House?  Will an appeals mechanism be built into this project?

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I compliment Deputy Brendan Smith for bringing this important motion before the House.  I welcome the visitors in the Visitors Gallery.  I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this critical motion for the future of our small schools.  Such schools are predominantly in rural areas and include minority faith schools.  The proposed cuts are discriminatory and extremely regressive.  As a proud past-pupil of a small two-teacher school - which later became a one-teacher school - I can speak tonight with personal experience of this subject.  That experience was a very positive one.  The educational establishment I attended was not only a school, but also a community facility.  It was a venue for community meetings such as neighbourhood watch and community games.  It was the lifeblood of the rural area.  In my experience, most of the work carried out in small schools, such as maintenance, gardening and the board of management was all done on a voluntary basis.We are under no illusions about the serious economic difficulty currently being experienced both at home and abroad.  Earlier this week, the Taoiseach was part of the team that negotiated the inter-governmental treaty to help secure the eurozone's future.  We share the view that our deficit must be brought down to 8.6% of GDP by the end of the year.  We published a fully-costed budget on how we would achieve that, but we totally disagree with the discriminatory manner in which the Government is pursuing this agenda.  On Tuesday, the Taoiseach told this House: "It is for us here, not for Europe, to decide how we should close the gap in spending over taxation".  In the last edition of the Sunday Independent Colm McCarthy asked where is the reform agenda on which the Government fought the last election.  He used the example of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, reversing his predecessorâs decision to abolish a quango that cost â¬3 million a year.  The Minister did that at the same time as he launched a savage attack on rural Ireland and people of minority faiths.  What would â¬3 million do for our small schools?  What happened to the Minister giving people a choice of patronage?  This decision will reduce choice, as minority faith schools will close.  Where are the savings to be made?  In the past decade we have witnessed major investments in personnel and physical infrastructure.  If schools amalgamate, as is the Ministerâs desire, what will happen to these buildings?  Where will the funds come from to provide extensions to new, amalgamated schools?  The programme for Government was negotiated in the full knowledge of our financial circumstances and refers to protecting front line services.  Is the Minister telling the people in the Visitors Gallery, outside and throughout Ireland that teachers in small schools are not front line services?  We are holding the Government to account for what it promised in the programme for the Government, not the lies the parties told in the election.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The Minister is disingenuous when he uses the argument that small schools are somehow better off than larger schools in terms of class size.  This ignores the challenges faced by small schools in terms of teaching children of different ages, grade and ability in one classroom setting.  I know because I was there.Last night, the Minister accused us of creating a new, manufactured and artificial division in rural Ireland.  Let us look at the communities that have travelled here tonight to express their anger.  Is it artificial?  It is not just Members on this side of the House who are totally opposed to these measures.  The Association of County and City Councils unanimously passed a motion calling for the reversal of these cuts.  The association is representative of members of all political parties and none and, just as the Government parties hold a majority in the House, they hold one in that association.  Members of the Government parties had busloads of people protesting outside the gates of Leinster House last week and were extremely disappointed-----

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I commend Deputy Smith on proposing this motion and I would like to see the student at the centre of the debate on education.  I call on the Minister to protect the most vulnerable in primary education, particularly to continue the supports in the classroom, including support for special needs.  We all agree that much more needs to be done.  I would like to see more understanding and a greater importance given to the role of small schools.  There does not seem to be any education policy other than amalgamations and closures and this is not good enough.  Rural communities are very concerned that increased class sizes will result from forced amalgamations of rural schools.  Rural schools are institutions like the Garda station and post office and are part of the nucleus of rural life.  If we are to improve literacy and numeracy, as the Minister said he is committed to doing, we should retain our current class sizes and devote more resources to primary education.  The reality is that small schools have been singled out for the bulk of education cuts in this budget.  Schools that are already marginalised will lose teachers from September.  Although there is a need to make savings, people cannot understand why the savings have a disproportionate burden on rural communities.Where will the money come from for the new school buildings if there are to be school closures and amalgamations?  Where will the money be found for school transport when savings have been made in recent years in school transport?  The school transport charges doubled from â¬50 to â¬100 and the primary family payment doubled to â¬220.  These measures will have a major impact on families.The staffing schedule has been referred to by many Deputies.  Why is it based on September 2011?  A member of the board of management at St. Gabriel's national school, Kilconnell, told me there are two children more in the school than last September.  In Castlehackett, County Galway, there were 49 pupils in September and there will be 51 in September 2012.  People are asking why they cannot retain a third mainstream teacher in the best interests of the pupils.Another issue concerns the decoupling of learning support and resource teaching.  Where the posts are amalgamated, unnecessary travel expenses are eliminated and wholetime teaching positions are created rather than having two teachers running between schools on a part-time basis.  In a typical three-teacher school in County Galway, the general allocation gives them 0.8 of a full-time position for teaching support.  The teacher must find five hours in another school.  There are six and a half extra hours of resource teaching in the school and a visiting teacher must come in.  These are ridiculous proposals and I hope the Minister will examine them.  When the INTO made a submission last March, it pointed out this issue, along with the issue of minority faith schools and smaller Gaeltacht schools.  TÃ¡ sÃ© le feiceÃ¡il go solÃ©ir go bhfuil dul chun cinn na Gaeilge bainte amach ag scoileanna beaga agus nach mbeadh an Ghaeilge comh lÃ¡idir i gceantair gan na scoileanna beaga.Small primary schools have enriched our society for many centuries and should be maintained and fostered.  I would like the Minister to examine the overall budget, not just the primary education budget.  The Minister's backbenchers say that primary education is the Cinderella of education.  The Minister should examine the budget and reverse the cuts.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I thank Deputy Brendan Smith for tabling this motion.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As the Deputy of a predominantly rural constituency, with 14 schools with four teachers or fewer in Offaly, I support the ethos, dedication, commitment and quality of education in these schools.  They are vital cogs in, and an integral part of, our communities.  They have been allowed to continue to prosper in the delivery of education to children.  I was interested in the comments of the Minister last night.  The contents of budget 2012 pertaining to education have been debated in successive motions in recent weeks.  With the help of his colleagues, Deputies Jim Daly and Keaveney, the Minister sought to politicise the argument in favour of cuts in education.  This motion follows on motions in previous weeks concerning cuts in DEIS schools, cuts in career guidance counsellors and increases in pupil-teacher ratios in one-teacher, two-teacher, three-teacher and four-teacher schools.  This discriminates against rural Ireland, schools in Gaeltacht areas and minority faith schools.  The Minister stated he did not want to see or contemplate amalgamation.  He did not want to see or contemplate school closures but he would contemplate them if they were put under his nose.  He would facilitate and help them through the process.  This was supported by Deputy Jim Daly when he spoke, saying that he would welcome a situation where one school would replace a cluster of schools, despite having stated moments earlier that his rural school would not be affected.  It seems it does not matter once it is not in his constituency.  This appears to the mantra of many Deputies.  When the Minister saw fit to politicise this debate, he saw fit to say his hands were tied and he was led by the troika.  He said he had to make cuts in education and predicates all his answers on education with this mantra.He, his party or his partners in Government had no such predications when they sought election.  They campaigned on the basis that they would not pay bondholders, which was their first U-turn.  They campaigned on the basis that they would not increase pupil teacher ratios, which was their second U-turn.  They campaigned on the basis that there would be no increase in third level fees, another U-turn.  They campaigned on the basis that the severe cuts to pay and social welfare which were made by the previous Government would be reversed, something which was not carried out and therefore is a U-turn.  The Minister and party campaigned on the basis that they would reverse the universal social charge, another U-turn.In the course of his speech the Minister condemned Deputies for seeking to divide urban and rural societies.  I can assure the Minister he can take full credit for that.  He proposed cuts to DEIS schools and measures which will lead to school closures.  He will leave secondary schools without career guidance counsellors.  He increased the cost of rural school transport, not by 10%, 15% or 70% but by 100%.  He decreased student grants and insisted that farm buildings be assessed for those applying for student grants.  These kinds of actions are creating the divide he talked about.In his speech yesterday the Minister reverted to another favourite mantra, attacking Fianna FÃ¡il and its record on education.  We have no problem in meeting that attack head-on.  When the Minister spoke in that regard he failed to say that since 1997 Fianna FÃ¡il invested â¬180 million in 4,000 rural schools.  He did not mention that Fianna FÃ¡il doubled the number of rural teachers since 1997.  The Government should check the information.

He sought to dampen our advancements and compared it to buying elections.Deputies should have a bit of respect.  I and my colleagues on this side of the House make no apology for the investments we made in education.  We expect an apology from the Government for the misleading manner in which it sought election and the subsequent abandonment of supposed core policies in education.  Make no mistake about it, the Government, by virtue of the last budget, has begun to make its own choices and decisions and will be judged on them in the future.  In arriving at those decisions and making those choices education is well down the list of priorities.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and thank my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, for tabling the motion.  We have had several Private Members' motions on education.  I do not understand why the Government and Minister have carried out such an onslaught on education.I refer to a letter I received, which is not party political, from a school principal in my constituency of Laois.  It states:I am writing to you as a concerned principal of a small rural school.  As you will be aware, in budget 2012 it has been decided by the present Government that the people teacher ratio for two, three and four teacher schools is to be consistently increased over the next three years.  This measure will bring about a loss of hundreds of teaching posts and the possible closure of two teacher  schools throughout the country.They are not my words, they are the words of a school principal who has gone to the trouble of writing a letter to all local public representatives to highlight the issue because parents and the wider public may not be aware of the particular details of the matter until it affects an individual school sometime in the future.The most worrying aspect of this issue is that in budget 2012 the Minister said the readjustment to staffing schedules is being phased in to encourage small schools to assess their options for amalgamation.  We know the Minister will not force amalgamation because he knows it is a matter for boards of management.  He will put schools in an impossible position where they will be faced with Hobson's choice, namely having to close and amalgamate with other schools several miles away.We all know the ratio for two teacher schools has been changed from 14 to 20, which is a massive increase.  In three teacher schools the ratio will increase from 51 to 56 over the next two years and to retain a fourth teacher the number of pupils required will increase from 81 to 86.  Throughout the country, 47% of schools have five teachers or less and 659 have fewer than 50 pupils.  In County Laois the proportions are much higher because it is not a city area.  There are a number of large schools with ten or 20 teachers but well over 20 schools in rural areas of the county have fewer than 50 pupils.  They are under threat.If the Minister can explain the financial rationale behind amalgamations I would be prepared to discuss the matter with him.  The mechanics of closing a school in a rural area are complex.  If there are two schools in a parish one will close and an extension will have to be built in the other to take care of the ten, 20 or 30 pupils that have moved.  The principal of the amalgamated school will retain his or her salary, therefore two salaries will have to be paid.  A bus will have to provide additional transport and there will be no change in capitation fees.  What is the real cost of closing schools?  There seems to be a particular bias against rural areas and small schools.Various colleagues have mentioned the budget proposals to amalgamate learning support and resource teaching provision will affect small schools.  Deputy Kitt mentioned  the issue and provided examples.  They cannot be combined because it would lead to a split in the service and mean that a school may not have sufficient hours for learning support or resource teaching.  It will have to be provided by different people and involve travel time between different schools when time should be spent in the classroom with pupils who need particular services.In recent weeks there have been several debates on DEIS schools.  The letter to which I referred is from a rural DEIS school.  We have concentrated on DEIS schools in urban areas but those in rural areas have been attacked.  The Minister has said he will make amendments and deal with the issue on a one-to-one basis but that has not happened.  We have heard empty words and seen no action.Several guidance counsellors were in the Visitors Gallery during a recent debate.  There is a generational problem in the House in regard to guidance counsellors.  When several members of the Cabinet went to school there was no such thing as a guidance counsellor and they do not know what they do.  A member of the Government asked guidance counsellors what they do, other than fill in CAO forms.  This demonstrated to me that senior members of Government do not understand or appreciate them.As has also been mentioned, there will be additional school transport costs for people in rural areas.  I hope against hope that the Minister will reconsider.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate.  I and every other Deputy in the House feel strongly about this issue.  What is the most important thing we can give our children?  It is an education and start in life.It is absolutely disgraceful to hear some of the commentary from Deputies berating other Deputies who have an elected mandate to come in here and represent the views and worries of people and children.  We in Fianna FÃ¡il have a mandate, as do Independent Deputies and those in government.  Deputies have asked how we dare to table a motion.The aim of the motion is to protect one, two, three and four teacher schools.  The Government does not understand that.  If four teacher schools lose one teacher it is a 25% cut in teaching capacity, not just insignificant budgetary arithmetic.  If the Government says that will not lead to the closure of schools, it is very misguided.  It should return to local communities to hear the truth.  All the people in the Visitors Gallery are saying the same thing, as are all the people outside.  The Government has its mandate and we have ours, but we have a common goal, that is, to represent the people who elected us.  Members opposite should not challenge anybody's mandate in the name of protecting their party position because they are now in a position of responsibility and must make choices to establish priorities.  They are simply not prioritising small schools.Let us return to the rhetoric of budget day.  Members opposite were all on message on that day stating there were no cuts to allowances or welfare rates.  If they ask the people in the disability sector, the unemployed, those on CE schemes or those in rural areas whether they are being attacked, they will be told they are.The Government told people before the election that front-line services would not be cut.  A consultant in Limerick, a chairman of the Labour Party in the city, stated the cuts to front-line health services are putting people's lives at risk.  Despite this, the Taoiseach completely rubbished this in the House for two weeks in a row.  What does that say about democracy?  What does it say about the Government's followers?  Members opposite should not be challenging us in the House in this regard.Has the Government produced an impact analysis of the cuts?  It has not.  When it suits it, it will fall back on an impact analysis.  The Members opposite sat in opposition for years requesting that the capital allowance schemes for hotels and apartment blocks be cut.  When they got into government, they relied on an impact analysis, although it was not to reverse the capital allowances in that they looked after their own builder buddies when it suited them.  They should not tell us it is all about protecting rural areas.When the Government Members talk about closing small schools, which is their agenda, they should at least be honest and up-front with people.  They are not at present.  They are trying to close small schools by stealth.

They are wrong to behave like a dictatorship.  They may have large numbers and carry on like a dictatorship but they should remember that, throughout the world, dictators were knocked over by the will of the people.  The people will eventually rise up against the Government.The Government is targeting the most vulnerable people in respect of rural schools.  It did not say to the schools before the election that it would make the budgetary decision it made.  It was not honest with the people.  It is targeting small schools, gaelscoileanna, Gaeltacht schools and minority-faith schools.  It should at least be up-front with them.  This is another of the Government's anti-rural measures.  It should at least be up-front and engage in an act of solidarity.  Members opposite should vote for the motion and not be so mealy-mouthed about the matter.

He made very clear yesterday that the very difficult financial and budgetary context in which Ireland is operating, which legacy we inherited from the last Fianna FÃ¡il-led Government, is creating an incredible challenge that must and will be faced up to by the current Government.Let me reiterate the essential realities that obtain.  The Government rejects the sensationalist and nakedly opportunistic claims that have been made continually over recent weeks about closing small schools.  The only thing that is changing for small schools is that the average class size will no longer be as advantageous as it has been in the past.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	739	No school likes to lose a teacher - that is quite simple and straightforward - but it is wrong for a desire to preserve the status quo in regard to teacher numbers and class sizes to result in unnecessary anxiety in local communities over the future of their schools.  It is important that the staffing levels in small schools be affordable and sustainable, particularly in these very difficult and challenging times.  In this regard, it is not sustainable to continue with advantageous staffing arrangements which, for example, provide a second classroom teacher in a school with just 12 pupils.Concerns were raised during the debate yesterday evening about the retrospective element of the budget measure.  Deputies Griffin and Kyne made specific reference to this again this evening.  The Minister stated very clearly in the debate yesterday evening that the existing staffing appeals process will be accessible to small schools.  Schools that are projecting increased enrolments that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term should take particular note of this fact.  The details on how the system will operate will be made clear in my Department's forthcoming circular on the staffing arrangements for the 2012-13 school year, which will be issued shortly to all schools.

He stated: "We have too many schools that do not have the capacity to give children the broad and rich educational experience they deserve".  He added:We cannot plan our future education system on the needs of school buildings.  It will be based on the needs of the pupils in those schools.Moreover, he said "A third of our 863 primary schools have fewer than 100 children enrolled" and that "difficult, sometimes unpopular, but necessary decisions" will have to be taken to reduce that number.

The Government fully acknowledges this and states clearly in its amendment to the motion that public services, including schools, must continue to be an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  However, this does not mean rural schools can simply stand still or should never have their staffing levels changed to levels that are more affordable and sustainable in these very difficult and challenging economic times.We must all work hard to ensure our public services are affordable and sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of the country in the 21st century.  As the Minister stated last night, this means improving our health system with fewer nurses and doctors, maintaining our infrastructure with fewer engineers and architects and educating our children with fewer teachers.Small schools always have been and will continue to be a key feature of our educational landscape.  I have trust and confidence in the capacity of school principals and teachers to play their part in making the best use of their available resources to achieve the very best possible educational outcomes for their pupils.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like others, I thank my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, for bringing forward this important motion.  All of us in our constituencies have in recent weeks since the budget been contacted by parents and teachers who are worried about the future of their schools.  This is as a result of a budget which unfairly targeted elements of rural Ireland.  We have had an opportunity to discuss some of the other issues here on various motions in the past month.  The approach of the Government to rural Ireland was never more evident than in regard to the impact this measure will have on the small rural schools, particularly those with under 86 pupils, and the way in which they are being treated and targeted.The proposed cuts will irreparably damage the education model that has been built up by successive Governments.  I do not wish to divide along party lines today.  In Government, the parties opposite did good things for small rural schools, as we did when in Government.  Collectively, we did much for education.  We did so because we believed in the primacy of education, in its capacity to set a foundation for our young people and to give them an education foundation at primary level that allowed them to go on to be industry leaders, teachers, doctors, nurses and public servants.To reach a capacity to allow this economy to return to a state of health, we will need the brightest and best.  We will need to give them the best chance.  The parties opposite lectured us on this a couple of years ago when we had to increase the pupil-teacher ratio.  That was a tough decision but it was fair, honest and upfront.  The Government, through its budgetary process, talked about retaining the pupil-teacher ratio and I heard the Minister say again last night that there would not be an increase in that ratio.  However, there will be an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in small rural schools.In my constituency alone, 63 schools are targeted for these cuts.  This is particularly difficult when one considers that these schools have worked well, delivered results and provided value for money.  Like my colleague, Deputy Troy, I am the product of a small, two-teacher rural school, and I am delighted my principal is in the Visitors Gallery tonight.  Those schools worked diligently but the fact is that if we are going to ultimately close these schools, or if we are going to strip out the teachers who are currently there, we will be offering a very different educational model.This is deeply unfair.  Many families moved back to rural Ireland to give their children the same opportunities they had.  They wanted to bring them up in the rural way of life.  Some of them sacrificed career opportunities in order to give their children those choices.  What the Government is now doing is changing the goalposts.  The Government is saying to those people who bought sites, acquired mortgages, built houses and paid their taxes that it has something different in mind for them, that it will close the school their children were attending and will impose on them an increased cost, increased journey time and a much poorer capacity to live and work in their rural communities.These people made sacrifices because they believed in repopulating rural areas.  The area I come from, covering parts of east Clare and west Clare, had suffered the drain towards the urban areas, where people travelled in order to gain employment or seek education, and they stayed there.  Over the past ten to 15 years, people have moved back into those communities because they value the quality of life there.  The increased journey time, the increased costs and the closure of those schools will come back to haunt all of us.I do not want to politicise this issue.  As others have said, we all have a mandate.  However, we have a duty to give our children the best possible opportunity.  They are the leaders of the future.  The education sector is a challenging environment, particularly for teaching staff.  When we consider the difficulties of operating in a multi-class environment, although the Government is suggesting that, somehow, the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio can happen and the same level of education can be attained and provided, it cannot.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I thank my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, and all of our colleagues on this side of the House as well as the Deputies on the other side of the House who over the course of the last two days have made some constructive suggestions and contributions on this issue.  We have all had the chance to highlight the very important role small schools, gaelscoileanna and schools of minority faith are playing on this island.  However, we on this side of the House have particularly highlighted the danger to their continued existence as a result of these cuts announced by the Minister and the Government.Let us be clear on this point.  There is a threat to the existence of many of these schools because of the measures that are being introduced.  A notion being propagated by the Minister that no school is being forced to close does not stand up beside the figures being issued by the Department to accompany this decision.  The changes that are being announced by the Department mean an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for the schools affected.  There is no hysteria in this because the Department has provided the figure that 47% of the 3,200 primary schools in the State have five teachers or fewer.  Every one of those schools will be affected by this change.  Maidir leis na scoileanna Gaeilge, caithfidh siad seacht ndalta breise a fhÃ¡il anois mar gheall ar an athrÃº seo.  Sin athrÃº sa chÃ³imheas mÃºinteoirÃ­ is dalta dos na scoileanna sin.  Those schools of minority faiths are getting the biggest cut of all and suffering the biggest demands of all.The retention figures are utterly inequitable.  A large school with 12 teachers needs another 28 pupils in order to become a 13-teacher school whereas a two-teacher school needs an additional 37 pupils to become a three-teacher school this September.  Small schools are taking a bigger hit and are being punished more than larger schools.The Government has changed the goalposts by backdating the changes to last September, thereby not giving the schools a chance to make the changes and attract students.  I am delighted many Deputies have referred to this point.  I hear about appeals procedures.  They do not exist in real life.  They are a cover to get the Government through this vote.  We were not given any detail as to how they will work.  Where were the appeals procedures or the demands for them when the Government parties were discussing the budget in their various parliamentary party meetings before the budget?  We would not need an appeals procedure if the Deputies opposite had been awake for that discussion.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	768	That is the message being sent to small communities throughout the island today.  Perhaps what the Department wants to achieve is that, by sending that message, it will plant the seed of doubt as to the future of the school in the parents, who will then make a choice to send their children to a larger school.  The Department can then wash its hands of the decision and blame the parents for making that choice.  If that is the way it intends to close down the schools, shame on the so-called Department of Education and Skills.Communities across this island are hearing this message.  Like many Deputies, I have received letters.  The following is the choice faced by the people of Leenane, on the Galway border.  Due to its geographical location, the nearest school is 24 km away.  Owing to the dispersal of the area, children from Leenane could end up going to four different schools, which would result in the division and the effective abandonment of young people in that community.For example, suppose there is a family with two children going to the faraway school, one with a pick-up time at 2 p.m., the other at 3 p.m.  It is 24 km away, there is no public transport and the way this Government is going perhaps the school bus system will go as well.  There will be days, therefore, when the family in question will have to do two or three runs back and over, some 48 km each time.  Nobody wins in that situation, not the student, not the parent, not the community.  That situation is replicated all over the country.The other myth propagated by the Minister of State who, I regret to say, lives in a rural area yet came in to the House and re-emphasised this message, is that small schools get more favourable capitation and other grant payments and have a favourable pupil-teacher ratio.  Yes, they have a more favourable PTR and a more favourable system.  They are entitled to it.  The Government amendment ignores the reality of life for smaller schools, na gaelscoileanna and the faith-based schools.  It ignores the fact that teachers in these schools face challenges that teachers in larger schools do not have.  It ignores the fact that teachers must address not only mixed abilities but mixed ages.  It ignores the fact that teachers and school communities in these areas are required to take a much bigger leadership role because of smaller staff numbers and a smaller school community.  It ignores the fact that smaller schools, gaelscoileanna and the faith-based schools have a smaller base on which to get their extra capitation money.The entire cut in this area is based on ignorance of the educational and societal value of the schools it directly targets.

If it is not appropriate to visit such a school now when is it appropriate?  He can visit small schools, like the one-teacher school in Glenmore just outside Ballina which is the Irish representative in a European-wide IT scheme.  This is the school he would try to dismiss.  Due to the investment of parents and the teacher in information technology this school did not lose any school days last year during the snow  because the children were connected to the school through the technology.That is the kind of thinking and innovation this country needs to get us moving again.  We have that thinking, that innovation and that passion for learning in small schools across this island, in our gaelscoileanna.  This cut will completely pull the ground from under that. How will we get this country moving again if we ruin the roots of recovery by doing this?

I very respectfully point the Minister in the direction of somebody who might be better equipped to talk about small Irish rural schools, the late Bryan MacMahon, the Master himself.  The Master has a saying in his book: "A teacher can leave the track of his teeth on a parish for three generations".  That is the influence teachers can have on their communities, their local GAA club, their church and every aspect.  By proceeding tonight with this cut, by withdrawing teachers from rural communities, the Minister of State will withdraw that influence.  He will pull an artery that supplies blood from the heart of rural communities.  One does not need to be a scientist to know that when one damages an artery one can fatally damage the living being.Tonight the Deputies opposite took part in a parliamentary party meeting about another issue, one provoked by an organisation called Stand up for Ireland.  I do not know what decision they came to.  I am not sure if we are waiting for white smoke.  What we want tonight is for the Deputies on the opposite side to stand up for minority faith education.

Ultimately, the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.Neither the Central Bank nor I have any responsibility for the variable mortgage interest rates charged by the financial institution mentioned by the Deputy. I have no powers to compel the institution to reduce its rates for existing customers to that charged for new customers. However, the Central Bank has advised me that, within its existing powers it will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.The Deputy may wish to note that there is a proposal before the House to give the Central Bank power to make regulations for facilitating the switching of business by customers to other financial service providers. This proposal is contained in Section 40(2)(m) of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 as initiated.

Where a transaction is challenged by the Revenue Commissioners under this section and the Courts uphold the challenge, the transaction is redefined to ensure that no tax is avoided.    I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent Supreme Court decision in the Revenue Commissioners v. OâFlynn Construction case. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in this case the Revenue Commissioners used Section 86 of the Finance Act 1989 (now Section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) to challenge a scheme entered into by the taxpayer and the Supreme Court upheld the Revenue Commissioners challenge.

The size of the impairment provision is not yet calculated as it is a complex exercise which is carried out under International Financial Reporting Rules (IFRS). The final level of impairment is subject to agreement between the Board of NAMA and its auditors the Comptroller and Auditor General. I understand that NAMA expects to publish its audited 2011 Annual Report and Accounts in June 2012.    I would also bring to the Deputy's attention the fact that the NAMA quarterly report to the end of September 2011 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday, and has been published on the NAMA website.  Finally, I am informed by NAMA that it expects to make a pre-impairment profit for 2012.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together.As the Deputies will be aware, earlier this week at the Informal European Council, Heads of State or Government announced that the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is ready for signature and the objective is that it enters into force in July 2012.  In line with decisions at the Heads of State or Government meeting on 21 July 2011, the ESM will have a wide range of tools available and a strong financial basis. As decided on 9th December 2011, the Heads of State or Government will reassess the adequacy of resources under the ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in March 2012. These decisions have now been incorporated into the ESM Treaty text.The ESM Treaty which is expected to be signed later this week by Euro Area Member States, subject to ratification, also provides that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the Intergovernmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union by the ESM Member concerned.  The linkage between the ESM and the Intergovernmental Treaty to ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its acceleration into force by July 2012.It has been clarified that the linkage of both the ESM and the Intergovernmental Treaties refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the EFSF to Ireland (and other programme countries).  The ESM will replace the EFSF. While the ESM may assume the rights and obligations of the EFSF, this should not affect the terms and conditions of the amounts transferred to the ESM and subsequently disbursed to Ireland.  Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement its decisions. It is expected that the required legislation will be published this term.

The troika has agreed to engage in a process with Irish officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.  In tandem with this technical review I have met with Commissioner Rehn and Mario Draghi President of the European Central Bank last week to progress the matter.  I would expect that work at a technical level will progress at a good pace, however given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.

The possible introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain flood insurance from insurance companies was examined in 2010. However, at that time, the Government concluded that such an approach was not financially viable. In particular, there were concerns that, over time, such a scheme could incentivise the insurance industry to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas, thereby making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.  I am advised by the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works that the OPW continues to liaise with the Irish Insurance Federation to ensure that the Federation and its members have access to up-to-date information on flood protection measures. The Minister of State has also advised me that he intends to arrange a meeting with representatives of the insurance industry early this year to provide a forum for the effective interchange of information and opinions in relation to flood risk management.

There are accrued property rights which subsist as a consequence of existing property mortgages; legislation to alter such mortgage contracts could raise constitutional issues.The Deputy might wish to note that the provision of non-recourse mortgages carries a higher level of risk for lenders. This risk would likely be reflected in higher costs to borrowers in the future.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	796	The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank. These lenders include sub-prime lenders registered with the Central Bank. The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank's website www.centralbank.ie.The Central Bank has advised me that in monitoring compliance with their consumer protection codes, they carry out themed inspections and mystery shopping exercises. In July 2011, the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with provision 9 of their Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and related individual Letters of Direction that were issued in December 2010. Provision 9 of the Code restricts lenders from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears outstanding in MARP cases. The Central Bank notifies each lender individually of the charges to which provision 9 applies by means of a letter of Direction. The issues found as a result of the inspection impacted on almost 3,100 mortgage accounts which were overcharged by nearly 70,000 euros. In a press Release dated 1 July 2011 on the results of the themed inspections, the Central Bank stated that all amounts overcharged were refunded and that the system errors were corrected.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	797	The special arrangement whereby public servants may retire before the end of February 2012 with pension and lump sum calculated on the basis of 2008 salary levels is part of Government policy designed to achieve a significant reduction in public service numbers.  It is of course open to any retiring public servant to invest all or part of their retirement lump sum in the State Savings products, the brand name used by the National Treasury Management Agency to describe the range of savings products offered by the NTMA to personal savers. Moneys raised through the sale of State Savings products are used to fund the Exchequer and repayment of all NTMA State Savings money, which includes principal, interest and bonus payments if due (or, in respect of Prize Bonds, cash prizes), is a direct, unconditional obligation of the Government of Ireland.The suite of State Savings products includes Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Instalment Savings and Deposit Accounts such as the Ordinary Deposit Account and the Deposit Account Plus. NTMA State Savings products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances.In relation to employment creation, I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May 2011 as part of the Jobs Initiative, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high-value-added tourism sector, are playing a role. The Jobs Initiative is an important part of the Government's overall strategy to establish the correct conditions to allow our domestic economy to recover, while at the same time respecting the requirement to return our public finances to a sustainable position. It should be viewed as one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity.The Government is giving priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed.  In this regard, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation will soon publish an Action Plan on Jobs.I might also mention that the Government announced in September 2011 the establishment of the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA) within the NTMA and the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund. As I have outlined in previous replies to this House, NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund are important elements in the Government's strategy to promote economic growth and create jobs.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	799	The imposition of lending restrictions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to examine or adjudicate on whether the placing of lending restrictions is necessary on a case by case basis.  I believe that such action would represent interference in the work of the independent regulator.The Registrar has put lending restrictions in place in order to protect the savings of members in credit unions and to ensure that credit unions focus on risks when making lending decisions. Restrictions are imposed on a case-by-case basis and are reviewed regularly.  The type of lending restrictions can include maximum individual loan size, overall maximum monthly lending limits and restrictions on business lending.The Registrar has advised that about 50% of credit unions are subject to lending restrictions at present.  Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions over 65% can lend â¬20,000 or more to an individual member. Less than 3% of credit unions are restricted to loans of less than â¬10,000 to an individual member, and less than 1% of credit unions are restricted to lending less than â¬5,000 per member.  Commercial lending restrictions apply to approximately a third of credit unions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	800	It is the stated intention of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to return to sovereign debt markets as soon as market conditions permit. On 25th January 2012 it re-engaged with the bond market and extended the maturity of some â¬3.5 billion of debt which was due for repayment just after the end of the EU/IMF Programme. This is a significant first step in terms of managing Ireland's post-Programme funding requirements.  The steps necessary to position the NTMA for such a return include continued progress in the reduction of the budget deficit in line with the targets agreed in the EU/IMF Programme, together with the implementation of policies that will see Ireland return to sustainable economic growth. Of course, resolution of the wider euro area sovereign debt and banking crisis is also a critical factor.The NTMA is in ongoing contact with market participants and will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets.  While the interest rates at which Ireland can borrow will obviously be a key determinant in this decision, they will not be the only factor. In any event, it would not be wise to speculate about what these interest rates may be as this would harm the State's ability to access funds at the most competitive rate possible.I should say that, based on conservative projections of Ireland's funding needs, there is no urgency about a return to the markets. Indeed, the purpose of a programme such as the EU/IMF Programme is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place. Based on current projections and assuming no capital market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.

First and foremost, it is clear that resolving the euro area sovereign debt crisis is a prerequisite for a return to sustainable growth, both in the euro area and the wider EU.  In this regard, we are now seeing concerted action to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union, including through the so-called âsix-pack' of legislative reforms as well as the agreement on a âfiscal compact' to ensure fiscal discipline in participating Member States.Another key policy response is the establishment of financial stabilisation mechanisms to support Member States whose access to private capital markets is constrained and to help avoid difficulties in one Member State spreading to other euro area Members States.It is also worthwhile to point out that EU leaders on 30 January committed to further efforts to promote growth and employment in the Union, including through a better targeting of available EU funds and further steps to complete the Single Market.All of these various commitments that Member States have entered into apply irrespective of the size of a country and it is essential that all within Europe play their part to maximize the benefits for all of our citizens.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	804	The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Government, therefore, established an Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears to consider what additional measures could be introduced to assist people experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Group's report was published last October and the implementation of its recommendations is a key part of the Government's ongoing efforts to tackle mortgage difficulty.  The Central Bank revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is the key framework that governs the relationship between lenders and borrowers who are in arrears, or facing arrears, on their mortgage and it provides a number of protections to borrowers.  These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) for handling such cases, the establishment of dedicated Arrears Support Units and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis.The Code also provides that a lender must not apply to the Courts to commence legal action for the repossession of a borrower's private residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower and that, where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the Court to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower's primary residence.  This twelve month period does not include any time where the borrower is complying with the terms of any alternative arrangement agreed with the lender, or being processed by the internal Appeals Board, or any time during which a complaint against the lender against any aspect of the Mortgage Arrears Code is being processed by the Financial Services Ombudsman's Office.  In addition, lenders are restricted from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the Code applies and in respect of which the borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the MARP process.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears âMortgage Arrears â A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender' and this is available on the Central Bank website.More recently, the Central Bank has also required licensed mortgage lenders to develop comprehensive strategies and implementation plans to deal with their individual mortgage arrears situations.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing these strategies and plans to ensure that they are addressing the problem and that mortgage lenders are looking at appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group report and other options that banks may develop themselves, for their customers who may have unsustainable mortgages.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders on the further development and implementation of these strategies and plans.In addition, as part of the overall process of implementing the Inter-Departmental Working Group recommendations, other developments are in train to assist distressed mortgage holders.  In that regard, the publication of a draft Personal Insolvency Bill by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence is a significant development.  The Inter-Departmental report stated that reformed personal insolvency law is a central requirement for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem and the draft Bill proposes a new Personal Insolvency Arrangement framework that would allow insolvent debtors and creditors to consider and reach formal agreements on proposals to address unsustainable mortgages in a non-judicial manner.  This draft Bill is now open for consultation and the submission of views by interested parties for the further consideration by Government in advance of the finalisation of a Bill by end April.

The first relates to the annual General Government deficit and the second relates to quarterly Exchequer primary balance targets. Neither of these targets is a structural one.  The new Treaty requires us to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms, in other words after adjustment for the impact of the economic cycle on the budgetary position.  This requirement will be deemed as respected if a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP is achieved. This target will be converted into a Medium-Term Objective (MTO) and the timeframe for convergence towards the MTO will be proposed by the Commission for each Member State taking into account country-specific sustainability.  At this point in time, it would be speculative to put forward a possible timeline for reaching the structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP.  My officials will continue to work with the Commission, highlighting the need for commonsense when interpreting the size of the structural fiscal position.

The 30 November, 2009 is the reference valuation date for the valuation of all assets acquired by NAMA. A decision to opt for a single reference date was made to ensure that all assets were valued on a consistent basis. Given that transfer of relevant assets to NAMA is now complete, there is no basis for making any changes to the valuation date. I therefore have no plans to make any change to the NAMA legislation as suggested by the Deputy.

I have also met Mr. Draghi on the margins of Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings since his appointment last November.At the meeting of 24th January last, I had a good discussion with Mr. Draghi on a number of issues, including on the excellent progress on the implementation of our EU/IMF Programme and on measures to help strengthen our Programme which would also assist our return to the markets. In relation to the latter, work at a technical level is currently under way with members of the Troika.On the 28th November 2011, a letter was furnished to Mr. Draghi, signed by myself and the Governor of the Central Bank, regarding the delivery of the agreed targets under the Troika programme.In addition, on the 8th November 2011, I received correspondence from Mr. Draghi in relation to the ECB's Opinion on the extension of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme and on the 8th December I received a copy of a letter from Mr. Draghi to the President of the ECOFIN, on the Opinion of the ECB Governing Council on a Council recommendation on the appointment of a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.I also met Commission Vice-President Rehn last week when in Brussels. As the Deputy is aware, I and other members of the Government make sure to take advantage of any appropriate opportunities to pursue contacts with Member States and with key partners such as the European Commission. Commission Vice-President Rehn and I discussed the Irish EU-IMF programme in the light of the recent visit of the Troika to Dublin, at which it was confirmed that Ireland's programme was on track. This assessment was endorsed by eurozone Heads of State and Government this week, whose communication welcomed the positive review of Ireland's programme.I discussed the Fiscal Compact Commission with Vice-President Rehn, which as the Deputy and the House is aware was agreed on Monday night in the form of an Intergovernmental Treaty among twenty-five member states of the European Union. The situation now is that the text of the Treaty will be prepared for signature and subsequent ratification by each of the participants.

("AIB"), it would not be appropriate for such documents to be made publicly available.  On 13 December 2010, AIB publicly announced that an instruction had been received from the Minister that the provision of further State funding to AIB would be conditional on the non-payment of any bonuses awarded, no matter when they may have been earned, since AIB would not be in a position to pay such bonuses in the absence of State support. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIB, EBS is subject to the same instruction. This instruction has been communicated to the legal advisers to UNITE the Union.The private contractual documents referred to above do not contain any material information relating to the non-payment of bonuses in addition to that which is already in the public domain.The Deputy will be aware that the industrial relations dispute is now before the Labour Relations Commission who are presently endeavouring to find an acceptable solution to all parties.  Accordingly, it would not be advisable to comment further at this stage.

The first phase of the Central Bank's review has concluded with the Bank writing to a number of companies notifying them that their activities are subject to regulation by the Central Bank and requiring that immediate steps be taken to provide additional protection to client funds.  In one case recently reported in the media the Central Bank has also intervened to communicate with clients and creditors.  Those companies subject to Central Bank regulation now need to seek authorisation from the Central Bank or to change their business model.  In the meantime the Central Bank is requiring that certain controls are in place regarding client assets.On the basis of advice received from the Central Bank and my officials I have agreed that all debt management and debt advice services of firms  should be subject to regulation.  I have asked my officials to prepare the necessary legislation which, subject to Government approval, will be brought forward as a Committee Stage amendment to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.

As he Deputy is aware I am not in a position to provide a list of the bondholders who were repaid the gross payment of â¬1.25 billion.  I am advised that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors.  Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue.  The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream).  When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.  The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders.  This is a standard process for all such issuances.  Therefore throughout this entire process the bond issuer is unaware of the individual bondholders' details.

On 5 Jan 2012, Aviva announced that its Life and Pensions (Ark Life) distribution arrangement with AIB will not be renewed in its current format when it expires in 2012.  As it is a commercial matter for the Bank, any future negotiations/agreements conducted by the Bank will presumably be concluded in a manner which derives the best economic return for the Bank and, by inference, the State.

In terms of discussions on the draft Treaty, the Taoiseach, TÃ¡naiste, I and other Ministers have at all times sought to keep the House and the relevant Committees informed.  Our priorities in the negotiations included ensuring clarity regarding the status of programme countries, ensuring as many clear linkages as possible with existing EU Treaties and enhancing references to economic growth.  I am happy that Ireland's interests and priorities were reflected in the agreed text.In addition to the commitment in the Intergovernmental Treaty to promote conditions for stronger economic growth, I would also draw attention to the statement by members of the European Council entitled "Growth-friendly Consolidation and Job-friendly Growth".  I strongly welcome this statement and the initiatives contained within it, which reflect issues Ireland had highlighted such as youth employment, the establishment of a digital single market and ensuring a competitive market for SMEs.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	813	In the 12 months to end September 2011, the last 12 month period for which figures are available, over 12 billion SMS messages and over 43 million MMS messages were sent in Ireland.  This information is based on figures for mobile telephone usage per quarter supplied by the companies to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  At those usage rates, a levy of 2 cent on such messages could raise c. â¬246 million per annum, which is in line with the figure indicated in the Deputy's question.However, this potential yield does not take account of any behavioural impact if a levy was directly imposed on customers or imposed on the mobile phone companies and passed on to customers.  Text messages are already subject to VAT at 23%.  While any additional revenue would be welcome in the current circumstances, wider social and economic factors which may militate against the introduction of a further tax on text messages would also have to be taken into account.  I am not aware of a similar tax anywhere else in the world.  Although there are no plans to introduce such a tax at this time, all potential taxation measures are kept under review.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	814	Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel.  The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel.  However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK.  The rates for petrol and auto-diesel were increased with effect from 7 December 2011, arising from an increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from â¬15 to â¬20 per tonne of CO2 emitted.  This represented an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre in the case of petrol and just over 1.5 cent per litre in the case of diesel, when VAT is included.  The rate of VAT that applies to those fuels increased from 21% to 23% with effect from 1 January 2012.The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed.  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.The issue of rising fuel prices was discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting last year where they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.

Essentially the banks will be smaller operations than previously with the focus being on the creation of the two universal full-service pillar banks with a more domestic remit and a restructured Irish Life & Permanent.  To date, AIB have indicated that some 2,000 plus jobs will have to go.  Job losses will arise at other institutions where, for example, recently Ulster Bank has announced the planned shedding of some 950 positions on the island of Ireland.  I am most anxious that, in this most sensitive of matters, all parties would be treated with the utmost consideration and respect.  In that vein, active discussions on the matter are taking place with the relevant institutions.As I have indicated in a recent reply to a Parliamentary Question on the subject, the redundancy terms previously available in the financial sector cannot be countenanced in the light of the changed and challenging circumstances at the covered institutions. The latest terms to be offered were at IBRC and are more reflective of the terms that will be available at the State supported banks.

The Commission is to take into account credit unions' not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.The Commission on Credit Unions submitted its Interim Report to me at the end of September 2011, which deals with Phase 1 of the Commission's work regarding the strengthening of the regulatory framework for credit unions including more effective governance and regulatory requirements.  The final report of the Commission on Credit Unions is due to be submitted to me by the end of March and I expect that it will deal with the remaining issues in the Commission's terms of reference, including restructuring.  I do not propose to bring forward proposals on restructuring of credit unions until I have had the benefit of considering the Commission's recommendations.The Commission on Credit Unions has recommended that the resolution powers granted to the Central Bank under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 should be considered for those credit unions that meet the intervention conditions.  Under the Act the Central Bank may take certain resolution actions where the intervention conditions under the Act are satisfied.  To date, the only resolution action taken has been in the case of Newbridge Credit Union where a Special Manager was appointed to undertake a review of the Credit Union with a view to ascertaining its financial position and to develop a plan to restore the institution's financial position considering all available options.Under the Act, initiation of further resolution interventions is a matter for the Central Bank.  In considering any such action, the priority for the Central Bank is to protect members of credit unions and their savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall.

These discussions are part of the overall restructuring of the banking sector. In the year 2011 the following external advisors have been engaged to provide support. Up to the end of December 2011 the costs were borne by the National Treasury Management Agency. From 2012 onwards costs associated with bank restructuring/shareholding management will generally be borne by the Department of Finance.     McKinsey & Company was engaged by the NTMA on 16 May 2011 until 31 December 2011 as external adviser on bank restructuring, to ensure a timely, efficient and effective process, and to review the proposals for merger and integration and related matters. A fixed fee, including expenses, of â¬2.75m was agreed for the engagement.The McKinsey & Company engagement has been extended for a further number of weeks in relation to the on-going discussions on funding options for IBRC (including promissory note) and related matters. This further engagement will be paid for by my Department.

In late 2011 the Taoiseach asked for the Central Bank's opinion on recent developments in mortgage interest rates and on possible action by the Central Bank in that regard.  In response to the Taoiseach's request, the Deputy Governor wrote to him on 11 November 2011. In his letter the Deputy Governor stated that the Central Bank was not requesting the power to have regulatory control over the setting of retail interest rates given that this could absolve banks of their responsibility to price risk accurately.  He indicated that experience of such controls in the past and in other countries, did not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce the availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. Binding controls would have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors in the market. By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would especially during the recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs. In his letter, the Deputy Governor also said that within its existing powers, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The new Treaty requires us to correct our debt to GDP ratio at a sufficient pace when it is above the 60 per cent threshold.  I would point out that the pace of the required correction under the new Treaty is the same as is already required under the reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact as part of the so-called âsix pack' of legislative reforms. Specifically, we will be required to reduce our debt to GDP ratio annually by one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate of 60%.  I would point out that a transition period will apply for all countries that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure on the basis of the deficit criterion, including Ireland.In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the ratio of debt to GDP that is important.  In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions, we can expect economic growth to do much of the "heavy lifting".  Furthermore, I think it's also worth pointing out that, irrespective of our international commitments, we need to get the debt to GDP ratio down to more manageable levels.  Otherwise we will just spend more and more of our revenues on servicing the debt burden, which reduces the amount we can spend on education, health, social welfare, and other areas.Budget 2012 forecasts that Ireland's General Government debt to GDP ratio will be 115% by 2015 down from 119% in 2013. In light of this, the present focus is on improving the General Government balance and stabilising the General Government debt position. Continued fiscal vigilance will gradually improve our public finances and reduce the General Government debt.Before concluding, it is also appropriate at this point for me to highlight the NTMA's recent success in switching around â¬3.5 billion worth of bonds due to mature in 2014 with bonds maturing in 2015 at a broadly similar annual interest rate.  This will smooth the maturity profile of Irish debt, and is a reflection of the improved market sentiment for Irish government paper.

Disbursements take place following the completion of the review process, with the approval by EU Finance Ministers at Eurogroup and ECOFIN and the IMF's Executive Board, of the reports prepared, respectively, by the European Commission Services and IMF staff.  The actual disbursements take place in the period following approval.The next planned disbursement from the IMF will be approximately â¬3.2 billion and is scheduled to take place, subject to approval, after their Executive Board meeting on February 27th.The second disbursement of approximately â¬482 million under the bilateral loan agreement with the UK took place on 30 January 2012.Subject to signature of the bilateral loan agreements with Sweden and Denmark, the first disbursements of â¬0.2 billion and â¬0.1 billion respectively are due to be drawn down following this review.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	823	There is a huge amount of uncertainty at the moment, as evidenced by the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area. Indeed, the recent downgrading of forecasts by the IMF â including those for Ireland â reflects heightened concern about the euro area and the wider global outlook.    Obviously as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, Ireland will be affected by weaker euro area growth. However, the substantial competitiveness improvements we have seen in recent years will provide some support. It is also important to point out that a weakening of activity in our main trading partners is already factored into my Department's forecasts for economic growth that underpin the 2012 Budget.The Budget forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3 per cent in 2012. This forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information (domestic and international) available up to end-November 2011, and was mid-range at that time. Given the highly uncertain environment, the Budget documentation also pointed to a number of risks to this forecast â some to the downside and some to the upside. These risks remain valid.While the weak external outlook is of concern, there have also been some positive developments since Budget time, not least of which is the trajectory for ECB interest rates which appears more favourable than was the case in November. In addition, recent exchange rate movements will provide some benefit to the exporting sector. I would also point out that some of the economic data â domestically and internationally â have not been as poor as some were assuming.  For example, high frequency survey data show that economic activity in the euro area increased in January, the first such increase in five months, while at home consumer sentiment picked up, as did new manufacturing export orders.Moreover, concerted action has been taken at European level to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union. Measures include the so-called âsix-pack' of legislative reforms, as well as the agreement on a âfiscal compact' to ensure fiscal discipline in participating Member States. I am confident that this strong policy response will contribute to a restoration of confidence in the euro area as we go through 2012.Over the coming months, my Department will continue to monitor the economic situation, both in terms of positive and negative developments and, as is the norm, will publish an updated macroeconomic assessment in the spring in the context of the Stability Programme Update. It is anticipated that the Update would be published in April in line with the requirements under the European semester agreed by Member States last year.

The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.  This review is at a technical level and while I would be aware of and fully briefed on Irish proposals, it would not appropriate for me, other than through Irish proposals, to attempt to directly influence this group.  I have every faith and reliance on the capacity and commitment of the Irish members to represent our views and influence proceedings within the normal dynamics of the group.  In tandem with this technical review I have commenced an intensive campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State.  I met Commissioner Rehn and Mario Draghi President of the European Central Bank this week to progress the matter. I have also discussed the matter with a number of my counterparts from other Member States.  Given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  I am advised by the Registry of Credit Unions that the information requested by the Deputy will take some time to collate and will be made available to the Deputy within the next week.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The law firms Arthur Cox and Matheson Ormsby Prentice (MOP) were engaged to provide legal advice in relation to various aspects of the proposed sale of Irish Life pursuant to the terms of a framework agreement put in place following a competitive tender in March 2011, for the NTMA Banking Unit.  These engagements were awarded by the NTMA in accordance with the delegation of certain banking system functions from the Minister for Finance to the NTMA in March 2010.  The cost paid by the NTMA/Department of Finance to date in relation to these legal services is â¬188,670.13 to Arthur Cox and â¬44,871.67 to MOP.As previously advised, Goldman Sachs was also engaged by the NTMA following a competitive tender in April 2011 as external advisor for the liability management exercises and capital raising transactions to be undertaken in respect of Anglo, AIB, BOI, ILP, EBS, INBS and also for advice on the sale of Irish Life.  The total cost of the engagement is up to â¬7.8 million and will be paid by the NTMA (following consultation with the Department of Finance) although a substantial portion of the fee will be reimbursed by the financial institutions involved.  It is worth bearing in mind that a large quantum of equity was generated from these LMEs (â¬5.6bn).  Furthermore, at the time of the Bank of Ireland recapitalisation Goldman Sachs played an important role in advising the State in relation to Bank of Ireland's capital raise, including, the sale of shares to a group of North American investors.  As a result of this work, the State's cash outlay for the 2011 PCAR bank recapitalisations was lower by â¬1.7bn than initially expected.The delegation of banking system functions to the NTMA ended in August 2011 with the secondment of the NTMA Banking Unit to the Department of Finance Banking Division.  Following the transfer, the NTMA continued to pay professional fees incurred by the Unit to 31st December 2011.  From 1st January 2012, these costs will be paid by the Department of Finance.

I therefore had no role to play in this decision.  AIB and Aviva are currently working closely to agree the separation process and following that, employees currently supporting the Ark Life business within the joint venture will transfer to AIB or another agreed provider. I do not have any input into this process, as it is a matter for the Board of AIB.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	828	First and foremost, I want to point out that the Government's priority for the public finances continues to be to meet the terms of the joint EU/IMF programme of financial assistance, which are designed to maintain the long-term sustainability of our budgetary position.  Nevertheless, over the longer term, the intergovernmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union   agreed on Monday by 25 Member States will require all Member States to adhere to a number of rules regarding the evolution of fiscal deficits and debt.  In relation to deficits, those Member States that have signed will be required to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms.  This requirement will be deemed respected if the structural balance is at its so-called country-specific Medium Term Objective.  It is important to recognise that targeting an appropriate structural balance has been a feature of the European fiscal framework for a number of years already.  Its application is reflected in the budgetary policies adopted by each Member State and it is in this context that any economic assessment arises.Turning to debt requirements where the ratio to GDP in Ireland is currently above the 60 per cent threshold.  The new intergovernmental Treaty, taking account of the relevant EU regulations, will therefore require us to correct this at a sufficient pace.  I would point out that the pace of the required correction under the new intergovernmental Treaty is the same as is already required under the reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact as part of the so-called âsix pack' of legislative reforms.  Specifically, we will be required to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio annually by one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.  I would point out that a transition period will apply for all countries that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure on the basis of the deficit criterion, including Ireland.In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the ratio of debt-to-GDP that is important.  In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions, over the medium to longer term we can expect economic growth to do much of the "heavy lifting" on the basis of the reforms we are now putting in place.  Furthermore, I think it is also worth pointing out that, irrespective of our international commitments, we need to get the debt-to-GDP ratio downwards to more manageable levels.  Otherwise we will just spend more and more of our tax revenue on servicing the debt burden, which reduces the amount we can spend on education, health, social welfare, and other areas.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The Government is committed to delivering a return to a successful vibrant economy.  In this context I have indicated that there is no private sector involvement for senior bank paper or Irish Sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  This commitment has been agreed with out external partners and is now the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built.  This strategy is working well as evidenced by the reduction in pricing of Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary markets and the successful bond exchange offer by the NTMA.As indicated the Minister is committed to reviewing the approach to the Promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State.  The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.  In tandem with this technical review the Government has commenced an intensive campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 to 60, inclusive, together.Just over two years have passed since Haiti was struck by one of the most devastating earthquakes in recent history, which killed more than 230,000 people and injured 300,000 others.  Given the scale of the death and destruction inflicted, it is perhaps little surprise to learn that the country is still struggling to rebuild and recover.Indeed, before the earthquake struck in January 2010, Haiti was already facing huge development challenges, with eighty percent of the population living below the poverty line and the worst income inequality indicators in the western hemisphere.  Moreover, the country's governing institutions have historically been very weak, with political challenges undermining development for generations.  At the same time, the state has long struggled to deliver basic services, economic development, or security to most of its population, not least because of political instability, high levels of corruption, poor public administration and a "brain drain" of talented individuals.Some slow but steady progress has undoubtedly been made over the past two years, with emergency aid keeping people alive and providing millions more with essential food, medicine, emergency shelter and water and sanitation.  At the same time however, half a million Haitians remain displaced and still living in tents and under tarpaulin sheeting.  Half of the quake rubble remains where it fell; cholera has become endemic and many Haitians struggle to access basic services.While the emergency relief effort during the two years after the earthquake should be regarded as a success, a great deal remains to be done in order to meet Haitians' long-term needs.  In particular, large-scale investment will continue to be required in order to provide both immediate humanitarian relief and to rebuild housing, revitalize urban planning, reconstitute destroyed communities, develop new communities and create employment opportunities.In addition, we recognise the longer term challenge of building an effective public administration in Haiti.  Government capacity and financial weakness limit the pace at which reconstruction can move ahead.  President Michel Martelly's new Government has promised an ambitious programme, including the provision of free primary education, the revival of the disbanded armed forces, and the eradication of corruption.  Ireland will continue to support the need for capacity building in our international policy engagement as well as financial support for the reconstruction of Haiti.Despite the many real achievements, some observers have suggested that the international community has been too slow in delivering the billions of dollars pledged for reconstruction in March 2010.For our part, we in Ireland have worked hard to meet our own commitments to the people of Haiti.  Some 90% â or â¬11.5 million â of the â¬13 million pledged at the Haiti Donor Conference in New York in March 2010 has now been committed.  We intend to meet our entire pledge during 2012.As the Deputy will be aware, Irish funding has prioritised the needs of the most vulnerable populations, including women and children as well as the basic humanitarian needs of the population more generally.  In this regard, support has been provided to a range of NGOs and UN agencies, including UNICEF, Concern, Goal, Plan, World Vision and Haven for the provision of clean water and sanitation, shelter and housing to the affected population.  A total of â¬1 million was also provided to the Haiti Reconstruction Trust Fund for projects managed by the World Bank in line with priorities agreed with the Haitian authorities, including capacity building.Since the earthquake, there have also been 18 deployments of the Irish Aid-administered Rapid Response Corps to Haiti to assist in areas such as logistics, engineering and water and sanitation.Other donors have also responded generously, in Europe and beyond.  Since 2010, the European Union (European Commission and Member States combined) has been the largest global donor to Haiti's humanitarian and development needs.  The European Commission alone pledged â¬522 million in assistance, seventy percent of which has already been committed.  EU funding is being used not only to address the direct effects of the earthquake, but also to support longer-term reconstruction and development, especially in areas relating to institutional capacity building and support for democracy, including the electoral process and governance.Of course not all donors have responded so generously or acted upon their original commitments or pledges.  We will therefore continue to use all available opportunities in international fora, in Brussels, New York, Geneva and elsewhere, to urge other donors to keep their promises and to provide the kind of long-term, co-ordinated and predictable funding which will be required in order to move Haiti from crisis to recovery.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	832	For 2012, the Government will provide a total of â¬639 million for ODA, which, on current projections, will represent over 0.5% of GNP.  Given our current economic circumstances this allocation represents a real commitment by the Government and people of Ireland to the world's poorest people.  The allocation represents a total reduction of â¬20 million on the projected outturn for 2011 â a reduction of â¬10 million in funding for Vote 27 (International Cooperation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an estimated fall of â¬10 million in ODA provided from other sources, notably as a result of an expected lower allocation of Ireland's share of the EU Development Cooperation Budget.Through the overseas aid programme the Government provides assistance to over ninety countries worldwide.  Nine have been designated as Programme Countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia.We are now in the process of allocating the overall budget for 2012, and therefore no individual country budgets have yet been identified.  As has been the case in recent years however, the allocations to Irish Aid's Programme Countries will be prioritised to the extent possible.In 2011 the budget for Ireland's bilateral aid programme in Ethiopia stood at approximately â¬26 million.  Given the ongoing crisis in the Horn of Africa and the need for humanitarian support in addition to our bilateral programme, I expect that the allocation to Ethiopia this year will remain at about the same level.  Our programme will therefore be able to maintain its commitment to the most vulnerable in Ethiopian society and continue to deliver impressive results such as those I saw first hand when visiting Irish Aid programmes and projects in Addis Ababa and the northern province of Tigray last week.I must note also the high regard in which Ireland's engagement in Ethiopia is held by those I met with during my visit.  While receiving plaudits from the OECD and other international bodies for the quality of our aid programme is always to be welcomed, having the opportunity to meet with the individuals and communities who are the ultimate beneficiaries of our programme, and to receive their thanks for the support of the Irish people over many years, has left me with a deep appreciation of the benefit of maintaining Ireland's programme of overseas aid, even in these times of economic difficulty.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	833	The Government remains closely engaged at both European Union and international level in monitoring the situation in Burma and in supporting the Burmese people in their struggle for democracy and human rights.  We have been encouraged by recent movements including the opening of dialogue between the Burmese Government and Aung San Suu Kyi as well as approval of the registration of her political party, the National League for Democracy.  We also view positively the negotiation of a cease-fire deal between the Burmese Government and ethnic rebels, the recent visits to Burma of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, and the reported release of a significant number of Burmese political prisoners.Together with my EU colleagues, and as a signal of our hope for Burma's continuing process of political reform, the EU has begun to take steps to ease the sanctions on Burma by suspending the visa ban on certain individuals.While the situation in Burma has improved, there is still much to achieve.  I hope for continuing reform over coming months, including the unconditional release of all remaining political prisoners as well as further action from the Burmese Government in addressing the concerns of ethnic minority groups and towards the establishment of comprehensive human rights protection for the people of Burma.  I remain optimistic that April's by-election â in which Aung San Suu Kyi is due to stand â will be characterised by free and fair conduct.I expect to speak with Aung San Suu Kyi, members of the National League for Democracy and other civil society organisations at an appropriate occasion in the future.  In the meantime, EU High Representative Ashton intends to visit Burma in the coming months and I look forward to hearing her report of the progress of reform.Together with my EU colleagues, I want recent developments to indicate a lasting change for the people of Burma and that they herald the beginning of a new era of peace, democracy and respect for human rights.  The actions of the Burmese Government over the next few months will be crucial to establishing their commitment to the process of reform and in securing the confidence and trust of the international community â including Ireland â which will be paying close attention during this transformational period.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that the strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Since mid- 2010, Revenue has conducted a series of nationwide intensive tobacco "blitz" type operations, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various inland retail points, including markets, for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  To date, Revenue has conducted nine such national tobacco "blitz" operations resulting in the seizure of over 34.6 million cigarettes and 1,715 kg of tobacco.  These intensive operations are of course additional to Revenue's ongoing day-to-day illicit tobacco operations.Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations.  Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level.  This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global basis.In the course of 2011 Revenue enforcement officers seized 109 million cigarettes with a retail value of â¬46 million and 11,158 kg of tobacco with a retail value of â¬4 million.  In addition Revenue secured one hundred and one court convictions for cigarette smuggling, with thirty custodial sentences, of which twenty were suspended, and fines of â¬136,300 imposed.  Another fifty-seven convictions were secured for the sale of unstamped tobacco products with thirteen custodial sentences, of which seven were suspended, and fines of â¬115,850 imposed.To date in 2012 Revenue enforcement officers have seized 1.5 million cigarettes with a retail value of â¬635,000 and 615 kg of tobacco with a retail value of â¬220,000.  In addition Revenue secured four court convictions for cigarette smuggling, with one custodial sentence of fifteen months, one suspended sentence of three years and fines totalling â¬5,000 imposed in the other two cases.  Another two convictions were secured for the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines totalling â¬5,000 imposed.The Revenue Commissioners have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco.  These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans.  This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue's website www.revenue.ie, includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.Revenue's strategic level plans include the taking of steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of its resources, further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level, a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.I understand the Deputy's reference to benefactors to mean those groups that derive a benefit from the illegal tobacco trade.  The individual activities that produce a profit from this criminal activity are many and varied.  On the international front the bulk smuggling of tobacco products in maritime containers is carried out mostly by organised criminal elements, while smaller scale smuggling by individuals and "ant smugglers" takes place by air and passenger ferry from countries having a low rate of tobacco tax.  Ant smuggling involves the organised and co-ordinated use of groups of air travellers to smuggle individual suitcase amounts of tobacco products.  At the domestic level organised crime also plays a role in the distribution of smuggled tobacco product, together with a variety of groups and individuals involved in street level transport and sale at locations such as markets and housing estates.I am advised that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the level of the illicit trade in cigarettes and consequently no method will exactly reflect the impact of Revenue's ongoing compliance and enforcement strategy on the illicit tobacco trade.  However, a survey commissioned by Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in 2009 estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  The 20% figure was further broken down as 14% illegal product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control commissioned a similar survey in the last quarter of 2010 and the results of this latest survey show a consistency with the 2009 figures i.e. 20% of all cigarettes consumed in the State were not taxed in the State with 14% again classified as illegal product and 6% classified as legal non-Irish duty paid product.  A further survey is currently under way.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	835	Although no formal proposals have yet been presented to the European Council, I understand mainly from media coverage that France and Germany are preparing a submission which recommends an acceleration of the negotiation process with regard to the European Commission's proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporation Tax Base (CCCTB).  The call for acceleration may reflect their concerns at the pace of the negotiations at the Council working group where approximately only one third of the text of the CCCTB proposal has been the subject of an initial examination.  The Danish Presidency are expected to present a progress report on the CCCTB discussions to Ecofin in May or June.With regard to the risk to Ireland's long established corporation tax policy, I would like to remind the Deputy that it is a well accepted principle that the setting of tax rates is the prerogative of each Member State.The explanatory memorandum attached to the European Commission's CCCTB Proposal explicitly states that there is no intention to extend harmonisation to the tax rates applied in Member States, however, the Proposal does involve the introduction of common rules for the computation of the tax base.Both I and the Government have made it clear that Ireland, like all other Member States, intends to actively engage in that process because only in that way can we absolutely ensure that all of the arguments are brought to the table.I want to assure the Deputy that it is clearly understood that our engagement is strictly on the basis that taxation is a matter of national competence and that the principle of unanimity in taxation is fully respected.

In the interim I can inform the Deputy that the respective banks have been approached regarding this query, and that at least one major Irish bank has confirmed that they maintain an audit trail of mortgages that have been securitised in the form of a flag in their electronic systems. In theory this information could be made available to the mortgage holder if requested.  When I have received the information required for a fuller response I will inform the Deputy in writing.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	838	The Central Statistics Office recently published the annual inflation figures for 2011.  On a HICP basis, inflation averaged 1.1 per cent while CPI inflation averaged 2.6 per cent.  This follows on from two years of negative inflation according to both measures.  It should be noted that the Irish rate of HICP inflation (which is used for comparison purposes) was the lowest in the euro area last year.  Looking at 2011 costs specifically, most of the upward price pressure stemmed from the pass-through of higher wholesale energy prices and increases in administered charges domestically.  In the case of CPI, higher mortgage interest costs were also a significant factor.With regard to planned increases in costs during 2012, the Budget inflation forecasts factored in all announced increases up to end-November 2011.  Taking these and other developments into account it is expected that inflation will remain moderate in 2012, with HICP inflation averaging 1.9 per cent.  Interest rate cuts by the ECB in recent months will boost household disposable income and will keep CPI inflation relatively modest.  It is expected to average 1.8 per cent this year.

The drafting of the Bill, which is fairly complex, is well advanced. The Finance Act 2011 contained measures to allow for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and for a 15% gross profit tax to betting exchanges. The taxation provisions are subject to a Ministerial Commencement order which can only be commenced when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  In relation to the taxation treatment of betting exchanges, it is the operator of the betting exchange that will be liable to the gross profit tax which is also the position in the UK.

I do not intend to make contact with the Bank on the matter nor will I request my officials to do so.  As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 159 on 24 January 2012, the lending institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities. Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.Neither the Central Bank nor I have any responsibility for the variable mortgage interest rate charged by the financial institution mentioned by the Deputy. I have no powers to compel the institution to reduce its rates. The Deputy will be aware of the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, a copy of which can be accessed on www.centralbank.ie.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The most significant saving that we have achieved on our debt dynamics results from the interest rate reduction on EU/IMF Programme funding announced following last July's Heads of State/Government meeting and the lengthening of maturities on Programme loans from an average duration of 7Â½ years to 12Â½ years in the case of EFSM and a minimum of 15 years in the case of EFSF.  This lengthening of maturities in particular will be of assistance as it means there is less pressure on the State to borrow to refinance maturing debt in the short-to-medium term, giving the State valuable breathing space to continue with the process of returning the economy to health and sustainability to the public finances. Estimates provided by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) show that the total savings on the EU facilities with an average life of 7Â½ years is some â¬9 billion. In addition, the estimated cost of IMF loans is expected to reduce as a result of increases in Ireland's IMF quota. The NTMA has estimated the overall benefit of this to be some â¬1.9 billion.  For 2012, it is estimated that the combined interest rate margin reductions and IMF quota impact will reduce the interest bill by some â¬0.9 billion.  In the case of the IMF loans, the estimated savings take account of a quota increase which will not come into effect before autumn 2012 at the earliest. These expected savings may change either upwards or downwards in the light of future quota revisions.Furthermore, we have taken steps to lessen the impact of the supports to the banking system. Of the â¬24 billion in capital identified as being required for the Irish banking sector following the March 2011 PCAR process, the net Exchequer contribution was some â¬6.5 billion. A further â¬10 billion was provided from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) with the balance of some â¬7.5 billion being sourced to date through burden sharing with subordinated bondholders, private investment, asset disposals and internal capital generation. The cost to the State was therefore significantly less than it might otherwise have been.In this regard we will continue to take initiatives that will lessen the impact on the sovereign of debt resulting from the banking crisis.

In this regard, we are now seeing concerted action to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union, including through the so-called âsix-pack' of legislative reforms as well as the agreement on a âfiscal compact' to ensure fiscal discipline in participating Member States.Another key policy response is the establishment of financial stabilisation mechanisms, to support Member States whose access to private capital markets is constrained and to help avoid difficulties in one Member State spreading to other euro area Members States.It is also worthwhile to point out that EU leaders on 30 January committed to further efforts to promote growth and employment in the Union, including through a better targeting of available EU funds and further steps to complete the Single Market.So, in summary, a number of positive steps are being taken to support recovery in both the euro area and the wider EU.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The Budget forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3 per cent in 2012. This forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information (domestic and international) available up to end-November 2011, and was mid-range at that time. Given the highly uncertain environment, the Budget documentation also pointed to a number of risks to this forecast â some to the downside and some to the upside.  This uncertainty has continued into 2012 and is reflected in the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area. Indeed, more recent forecasts and revisions â including those of the Troika â reflect heightened concerns about the euro area and the wider global outlook. However, there have also been positive developments, not least of which is the trajectory for ECB interest rates which appears more favourable than when the forecasts were compiled at Budget time. In addition, recent exchange rate movements will be of some benefit to the exporting sector.In terms of targets, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to fiscal targets. In this regard, while the Troika has revised down its real GDP growth forecast for this year, it still sees the overall deficit target of 8.6 per cent as achievable. There are of course risks to this, as is always the case with any forecast in any year. In this respect, it is important to highlight that it is the nominal growth rate of GDP (i.e. volume and price changes) which drives tax revenue and affects the various fiscal ratios. It is also crucial to point out that the Exchequer budgetary position at end-2011 was slightly better than anticipated at Budget time.My Department will continue to monitor the economic and budgetary situation, in particular the monthly Exchequer Statements (the end-January Statement will be published tomorrow), and this will inform official thinking over the coming months. As is the norm, my Department will publish a revised set of economic and budgetary forecasts in the April Stability Programme Update.

In respect of Budget 2012 we received in the order of 700 submissions from a variety of interest groups, representative bodies, commercial organisations and individuals.  Submissions covered a wide range of economic and taxation issues ranging from suggestions for economic initiatives to requests for particular measures to be included, or excluded, from the Budget. These submissions were distributed to the relevant officials in both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform for consideration in the course of the Budget preparation process.  In addition, I met with various representative bodies in the weeks preceding Budget 2012. These included ICTU, IBEC, the ICMSA, the IFA, the CIF and the Community and Voluntary Pillar.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	845	In preparing Exchequer tax forecasts the methodology adopted by my Department at Budget time involves the estimation of the outturn for the outgoing year across a series of tax headings.  This becomes the base for the preparation of the projection for the forecast year.  The resulting projected outturn is then adjusted as necessary to take account of the effects of previous Budget measures which may have a pass-through effect or any known one-off factors likely to impact upon the yield.  To this resulting "cleaned" base, the key macroeconomic driver of each tax heading, is applied. The impact of any Budget day policy measures are also incorporated.  With respect to macroeconomic developments, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is the nominal growth rate of GDP (i.e. volume and price changes) which drives overall tax revenue and affects the various fiscal ratios.As we are only a month into the New Year, it is too soon to be talking about the impact of on-going influences on the Exchequer tax receipts for this year. My Department will continue to monitor the economic and budgetary situation over the coming months, in particular the monthly Exchequer Statement, and this will inform official thinking on these matters. As is the norm, my Department will publish a revised set of economic and budgetary forecasts in the April Stability Programme Update.

This forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information (domestic and international) available up to end-November 2011, and was mid-range at that time.  Given the highly uncertain environment, the Budget documentation also pointed to a number of risks to this forecast â some to the downside and some to the upside.The ongoing euro area sovereign debt crisis is contributing to an uncertain economic environment.  This, in turn, is impacting upon confidence in the euro area and weighing on the region's growth prospects.Obviously as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, we in Ireland will be affected by the soft patch that the euro area is currently going through.  However, the substantial competitiveness improvements we have seen in recent years will provide some support.  It is also important to point out that a weakening of activity in our main trading partners is already factored into my Department's forecasts for economic growth that underpin the Budget.The uncertainty, in particular internationally, has continued into 2012 and is reflected in the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area.  Indeed, more recent forecasts and revisions reflect heightened concerns about the euro-area outlook.  However, there have also been positive developments, not least of which is the trajectory for ECB interest rates which appears more favourable than when the forecasts were compiled at Budget time.  In addition, recent exchange rate movements will provide some benefit for the exporting sector.Over the coming months, my Department will continue to monitor the economic situation, both in terms of positive and negative developments and, as is the norm, will publish an updated macroeconomic assessment in the spring in the context of the Stability Programme Update.  It is anticipated that the Update would be published in April in the context of the requirements under the European semester agreed by Member States last year.In terms of the wider question regarding the resolution of the euro area crisis, my view is that we are now seeing concerted action to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union, including the so-called âsix-pack' of legislative reforms as well as the agreement on a âfiscal compact' to ensure fiscal discipline in participating Member States.Finally, it is also worthwhile pointing out that EU leaders on 30 January committed to further efforts to promote growth and employment in the Union, including through a better targeting of available EU funds and further steps to complete the Single Market.

This is in addition to the fact that over the 2009-2010 period, unit labour costs in Ireland fell more than in any other euro area country.  With regard to price competitiveness, Ireland had the lowest rate of HICP inflation in the euro area in 2011.  This follows on from 2009 and 2010, where prices fell in Ireland but rose in most other euro area Member States.These improvements in competitiveness are standing to us â figures from the IDA show that a record number of new investments were won in 2011.It is crucial that the competitiveness gains made in the last number of years be sustained and further gains be made so as to support export growth and underpin the economy's recovery and job creation.  With regard to areas where further efforts are required, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recent National Competitiveness Council report.  This notes that competitiveness is improving and that action has been taken, while also recommending a series of additional steps aimed at, inter alia, reducing the cost of doing business and increasing productivity.  This report is a useful input and will inform Government thinking and action over the coming months.

The fallout from this ultimately necessitated a programme of external financial assistance from the EU/IMF.  However, since this Government took office we have actively set about addressing the challenges facing the State.On the banking side, we have recapitalised and restructured the domestic banking system to make it fit for purpose.  We have acknowledged the credit problems facing SMEs and established a loan-guarantee scheme.  There is also ongoing work with the Troika on the issue of the Promissory Notes.The Government has stabilised the public finances and placed them firmly on a downward trajectory.  We have met the targets set out under the EU-IMF Programme.  Indeed, on the deficit target for 2011, we came in at an estimated -10.1 per cent of GDP, well under the -10.6 per cent required.  During the summer, in discussions with his European colleagues, the Taoiseach secured a reduction in the interest rate being charged on Programme funding.Economic growth has returned, led by the exporting sectors and facilitated by inter alia  improvements in competitiveness.  Notwithstanding considerable uncertainty, all forecasters, domestic and international, expect the economy to continue to grow in 2012.  While these are positive developments, the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high.  Recognising this, the Government has given top priority to the creation and preservation of jobs including a Jobs Initiative in May 2011.  Additionally, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will soon publish an âAction Plan on Jobsâ.So progress is being made on the economy, stabilising the public finances and in the banking sector.

The  level of fees charged is a matter for the schools themselves.  Immigration  permission is not granted for students intending to enrol in non-fee charging  schools.    In addition to the student immigration position, it should be noted that under  the Equal Status Act 2000, schools may not discriminate on the grounds of  nationality in relation to admission or the terms or conditions of admission.   This means that a school cannot charge a fee to a non-EU student if it does not  charge fees generally.

As a result, no changes were made to the eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in the recent Budget. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.Nevertheless, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to any maintenance payment under the Student Grant Scheme. Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level. This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a â¬2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. My Department estimates this will help an additional 4,000 postgraduate students. However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.In addition to this, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need. Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees. While it is regrettable that any changes need to be made to student support, I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students and allow us to maintain the high level of supports provided to undergraduate students.

In common with many other State-funded initiatives, the ICT in Schools programme has needed to re-evaluate its spending priorities in order to ensure that it can continue to deliver essential services notwithstanding an unavoidable reduction in the overall level of resources available.The contracts for providing this service expire on 4th February and there are no plans to renew them.  Other options of providing access to maps are being examined within the context of available resources and value for money.  The Scoilnet service will continue to make other Geography-related digital resources available through its portal and the PDST will continue to support teachers in this area.

In actual fact speech therapy services are provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) which receives the financial vote for the provision of such services.  There are therefore no services currently being provided by my Department which will no longer be provided under the new legislation. Rather, the amendment is necessary to clarify the actual position in relation to the delivery of speech therapy services to students of school going age. The legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the de facto position, which is that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the HSE. The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability through the HSE of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs.My Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and will continue to work with service providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team.

I understand that an email issued to the student referred to by the Deputy from CDVEC on 24th January requesting additional specific documentation. As soon as the requested documentation has been provided to the VEC, it will be in a position to proceed with processing of the application.In addition to the grant scheme students in exceptional financial circumstances can apply for assistance under the Student Assistance Fund. Information on the Fund is available through the access offices of third-level institutions.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	859	As part of its Reform Agenda, the Government is committed to reducing public service numbers to 282,500 by the end of 2015 with the aim of producing a more customer-focused, leaner, more efficient, better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.Numbers employed in the Public Service and Non-commercial State Agencies (NCSAs) are estimated to have decreased by over 8,000 in 2011.It would not be correct to equate the reduction in numbers employed with a loss of specific numbers of jobs or a reduction in public services.  Where vacancies arise it is a matter for local management to reorganise work, change methods of service delivery or redeploy staff to the most critical areas in order to ensure services are maintained in keeping with Government policy.Meeting our challenging numbers targets will require continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment with exceptions being limited to only essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment as the primary mechanism to fill posts which have been approved.  Only after all mechanisms set out in the Public Service Reform Plan are utilised will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.Should a Department identify a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment the sanction of my Department must then be sought. Exceptions to the moratorium may be granted on the following basis:a) statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;b) where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU/international regulations and impact upon exports etc.;c) safety related posts â failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;d) specialist/technical posts to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;e) to ensure continuity of frontline services.In addition, in the case of the Education and Health Sector, a number of grades are exempted from the moratorium in order to ensure that certain services are maintained.Each Sector in the Public Service has been establishing its own Strategic Workforce Planning Group to ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions in the coming years. The sectoral groups are liaising with the central Strategic Workforce Planning Forum under my Department.

Between 2009 and 2010 savings were achieved in the categories of Members' Fees and Members' Travel and Subsistence as a result of procedural changes at the Tribunal. The significantly increased figures in all expenditure categories in respect of 2011 arise from the Tribunal's handling of an additional 302 valuation appeals in respect of the revaluation of properties in the DÃºn Laoghaire Rathdown Rating Authority Area.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	862	Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.The Government's Jobs Initiative, which was announced last May, was aimed at building confidence to encourage consumers to spend, providing opportunities for re-skilling those who have lost their jobs, and assisting people to get back to work.  It is a cross-Government initiative and the impacts are being seen across a range of sectors.It is not possible to indicate the exact number of positions which have been filled as a result of the measures which were taken in the Jobs Initiative, as there are indirect as well as direct impacts arising from the Initiative.  However, there is no doubt that the measures introduced by the Government in May 2011 are contributing to both maintaining existing jobs and creating new ones.For example, the measures in relation to reducing VAT and PRSI rates were credited by the Restaurant Association of Ireland with the creation of 490 new jobs in that sector within the first two months of the implementation of the Jobs Initiative.  The Government has also brought in a visa-waiver scheme, which was announced in the Jobs Initiative, to further support tourism.  Overseas tourist numbers for the first eleven months of 2011 were up 6.8% on the same period in 2010. The number of visitors from mainland Europe was up 8.5%, and visitors from North America were up 5.6%.The Jobs Initiative targeted Capital spending at labour-intensive local projects, focussing on school works, local roads, energy efficiency and smarter travel projects.  The Minister of State for Public Transport, Alan Kelly TD, indicated recently that work undertaken between May and October 2011 on sustainable travel projects has created over 14,500 days of employment for local contractors around the country.The level of take-up and activity under the domestic retrofitting schemes to date is demonstrably supporting employment.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) reported in November 2011 that over 5,800 full time jobs were supported in this sector in 2011.The JobBridge National Internship Programme was launched on 1 July last as part of the Jobs Initiative, and has already seen almost 3,700 interns start with host organisations up to 26 January, as well as a further 630 who transferred to JobBridge from the Work Placement Programme.  A further 1,577 internship opportunities were available on the JobBridge website last week.  Feedback from the Department of Social Protection indicates that the first cohort of interns to have participated in the scheme are already being offered full time positions in a number of cases.Building on the Jobs Initiative, I am currently finalising an Action Plan for Jobs for Government.  This Plan will be launched in the coming weeks and will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.

Decisions relating to the recruitment of individuals with the appropriate skills for particular posts in those companies are entirely at the employers' discretion.Where companies require staff with an appropriate skills set, they can make contact with the state training and job placement agency FÃS or, alternatively, they can use a number of the well established private recruitment agencies, operating under employment agency licences received from my Department.Enterprise Ireland is responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector. The agency's mission is to accelerate the development of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets resulting in increased national and regional prosperity. Enterprise Ireland works closely with individual companies and sectorial groups, offering a wide range of services.Enterprise Ireland does not offer any specific grants to encourage or compel employers to hire workers from the live register. However, Enterprise Ireland's Job Expansion Fund directly assists client companies to achieve enhanced growth through increased employment.  The fund provides grant support to SMEs up to a maximum of â¬150,000 towards the recruitment of new employees.IDA Ireland  seeks to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland  while Shannon Development provides grants to both Irish and FDI companies located in the Shannon Free Zone. The support packages offered by both agencies encourage companies to take part in the Irish and global economic recovery and to improve competitiveness and growth.As agencies operating under the aegis of my Department the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulating economic activity and entrepreneurship throughout their respective areas across the county. The CEBs deliver a range of tailored programmes and supports through the provision of both financial assistance and non-financial assistance. Business growth, job creation and retention considerations are central to the activities of CEBs.The enterprise agencies under my Department's remit make their client companies aware of schemes administered by the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners aimed at taking people off of the live register, such as the Revenue Job Assist Scheme.On Monday last, I attended the launch of the âJoint Government â Industry ICT Action Plan: Meeting the High-Level Skills Needs of Enterprises in Ireland', which I launched alongside my colleague, Mr RuairÃ­ Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills.  More than 750 places are being made available on 17 new graduate skills conversion programmes across the country.   This will see the upskilling of individuals currently on the  live register, at no cost to the participants.The plan also sets out how we will increase the supply and quality of graduates in the medium to long term.  We aim to double the annual outturn of ICT graduates from 1,000 in 2012 to 2,000 by 2018.  There are currently over 1,000 vacancies and there is great potential for future growth within the ICT sector if we can get an increase in those people with the necessary skills.I believe that this plan will be a major contributor in getting the country back to work.  Such a plan was brought about through joined up thinking of Government, its agencies and private industry, where we have combined forces to develop the plan, which sends a strong signal of our intention to meet the skills needs of the ICT sector.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14301	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I wish to inform the Deputy that I have not put forward any proposals to enact a Stop Online Piracy style law.However, I would point out that an issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the Court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to  transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8  (3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed Statutory Instrument amending Section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with interested parties in relation to any issues or concerns that they have raised in relation to the matter.The amended text of the proposed Statutory Instrument was recently published by my Department.  It should be noted that this matter was also the subject of a DÃ¡il debate on 31 January 2012.  I would expect that this legislative measure will be introduced shortly.I wish to state that the measures being proposed in the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States are of an entirely different order to that being put forward in the Statutory Instrument.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	867	The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.   This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.There are two categories of contributory State pension:-  State pension (transition) (SPT) payable at age 65 and State pension (contributory) (SPC) payable at age 66.The qualifying conditions for State pension (transition) require the applicant to:have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 55 years.have at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid  since the date of entry into insurance.Have a minimum yearly average of 24 contributions (paid or credited) since the date of entry into insurance.have retired from work.State pension (transition) ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to (SPC).The qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) require the applicant to:have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years.have at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid, from employment or self-employment, since entry into insuranceHave a minimum yearly average of 10 contributions (paid or credited) since the date of entry into insurance.The planned changes are as follows:The minimum paid contributions requirement for SPT and SPC will increase to 520 in April 2012 as provided for in legislation since 1997.As provided for in recent legislation, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66 and SPT will no longer be payable to those who reach age 65 in 2014 or later.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.A âtotal contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   The proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  This change reflects the potential that people now have to accumulate contributions as a result of the comprehensive nature of social insurance coverage which has been in place for 20 years, and the growth in the labour force over that period.  Accordingly, a total contributions requirement of 30 years' contributions for a maximum pension will be introduced.  Under the new approach, a minimum rate of State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable at one third (10/30ths) of the maximum rate, which will be 30/30ths.As announced in Budget 2012, a change to the rates bands for contributory pensions is being introduced from September 2012.  This supports the policy objective of aligning the proportion of pension paid with the person's contribution to the PRSI system over a working life.  This policy needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only â¬4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions, a situation which is neither fair, equitable nor sustainable.With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 yearly average contributions will be replaced with  new rate bands of between:â(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions(ii) 30 and 39 yearly average contribution and(iii) 20 and 29 yearly average contributions.Therefore, the rate of State pension paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.   Existing pension recipients are unaffected and any changes will only apply to new claimants from September 2012.  A person qualifying for State pension in July 2013 will be assessed using the new rate bands.   Claimants who qualify for a reduced rate of State pension (contributory) may qualify for a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory).The measures outlined above support the social contract between the State and the individual whereby those who pay most in a working life benefit most in retirement.Details of the new rates bands for both State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) are set out in the following tables:Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Weekâ¬48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0024-29196.00Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Weekâ¬48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0020-29196.0015-19150.0010-1492.00

These excepted people include: a qualified adult; a dependent child or children aged between 18 and 22 years of age,  if in full-time education; a person who would qualify for the allowances in his or her own right; or a person providing full time care and attention.The claim for household benefits has been disallowed in this instance, not on the basis of a means test as such, but as the household composition rules are not satisfied.The household benefits package is made up of three allowances, electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence. These allowances provide contributions towards electricity or natural gas or bottled gas refill bill and telephone bill and cover the cost of the television licence each year. Provision for 2011 on household benefits was â¬382 million.  As of end of December 2011 there were over 400,000 customers on household benefits package.One of the objectives of the household benefits package is to provide assistance to older people who are living alone or with certain excepted people by targeting them with specific benefits that provide both income and social inclusion gains.

Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.The Corrib Project requires a number of statutory permissions in order for the developer to construct, operate and maintain the development.In February of last year, the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources granted consent to the Corrib Partners pursuant to Section 40 of the Gas Act, 1976 and Section 13 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 to construct, but not commission, the Corrib Gas Pipeline, subject to 47 conditions.The Deputy might also note that other licences and permissions beyond my statutory remit, including planning permission, Foreshore Licence and an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Licence are also required with respect to the construction and operation of the Corrib Gas Pipeline.Legal challenges to the consents granted pursuant to both the Gas and Petroleum Acts and the Planning Permission granted by An Bord PleanÃ¡la were settled towards the end of last year.Works on the development commenced last summer.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, will take in the region of three years.  First gas cannot therefore reasonably be anticipated before 2014.With regard to encouraging gas and oil exploration in Ireland, I can tell the Deputy that my Department is actively promoting and sponsoring major petroleum research projects designed to provide exploration companies with a much better understanding of resource potential during the next two years.  My Department is also engaging with the industry to see how critical data gaps in the frontier basins, which are hindering deep-water exploration, can be addressed in the near future. These initiatives should be of considerable assistance in encouraging new exploration effort in the search for indigenous hydrocarbon reserves.I would also remind the Deputy of the results of the 2011 Atlantic Margin Round, which featured a number of special initiatives designed to encourage new momentum in the level of exploration activity.  Under the Round, Licensing Options were offered in frontier basins for the first time.  The response from the exploration industry was positive and gives some grounds for confidence.  Key facts include:Fifteen applications were received by the deadline compared to two in the previous round.Thirteen Licensing Options have been awarded which cover a total area of just over 15,000 square kilometres and comprise 55 full blocks and 7 part blocks.Twelve companies were involved in the awards, seven of which were new to Ireland.A wide variety of exploration plays were recognised, some of which were the focus of the Department's recent technical promotion campaigns.The outcome of 2011 Round confirms that this is the correct strategy to encourage exploration.  Both the number of applications and the number of awards resulting from the Round are the highest of any Frontier Round, the first of which was in 1994.  I am optimistic that the holders of many of the new licensing options will be successful in identifying exploration opportunities that warrant progression to full exploration licences and substantial further work programmes.

My Department is responsible for these elements of the overall programme, while the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine is responsible for the elements of the programme that directly support the agriculture sector.These 35 Local Development Companies are also involved in the implementation of a broad range of publicly-funded local programmes and initiatives.  It is in the context of their broader local development role that I am currently engaging with the local development sector as part of an examination of the scope for enhanced alignment between local development programmes and local government.  I have established a Steering Group to advise me on this issue and expect its final report soon.  The Group presented an interim report in December 2011 which is available on my Department's website at: http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/ Community/AlignmentLocalGovLocalDev/FileDownLoad,28839,en.pdf.I am aware that, in general, there has been successful implementation of rural development programmes in Ireland and that the local development structures involved with these programmes are a key part of that success.  At the same time, given the very significant range of both EU and Exchequer supported local development programmes being implemented around the country through a range of local development entities, it is appropriate that there is a strong and continuous focus on efficiency and effectiveness in relation to these programmes. Our local government system is a key part of our democratic process and it is appropriate that it has a role in local and community development programmes.The focus of the Steering Group is on improving efficiency, effectiveness and services to the citizen, and on enhancing the role of local government in the area of local development. I am fully aware of the guidance of the EU regarding community participation in rural development programmes, and this guidance will continue to be fully respected for the current and future programmes.

The exemptions from payment of the household charge areâResidential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concernâOwners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.There is no exemption or waiver in the legislation, or proposed, in respect of persons who are paying management fees.With a view to improving consumer protection, the recently enacted Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 includes provisions for the licensing of property services providers, including providers of property management services.  Section 43 of the Act will oblige licensees to provide a letter of engagement containing detailed information on the services to be provided in accordance with Parts 1 and 4 of Schedule 2.  Moreover, the statutory functions of the Property Services Regulatory Authority will include the investigation of complaints concerning the provision of property services by licensees.

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority. Galway County Council submitted a proposal under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) on 6 October 2011 for a 17-unit scheme at Hymany, Ballinasloe, to be undertaken by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.I will, in the context of an examination of existing programme commitments under CAS, give consideration to the financial scope for new CAS projects during 2012.  It will be a matter for Galway County Council to prioritise projects locally having regard to the relative merit of any proposals received and the extent to which they meet housing need.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	891	The Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 sets out the duties for owners of domestic waste water treatment systems including septic tanks.  The Bill requires an owner of such a system to ensure that it does not constitute, or is not likely to constitute, a risk to human health or the environment and, in particular, that it does not create a risk to water, air or soil, or to plants and animals, create a nuisance through noise or odours, or adversely affect the countryside or places of special interest.As I stated in reply to Question Nos. 171, 174, 175, 176, 177 and 180 of 19 January, it is not intended  to apply new standards, for example as set out in the EPA's 2009 Code of Practice, to older on-site systems as part of the new inspection system.  Where an inspection reveals a problem, issues such as existing site size, hydrological and geological conditions etc. will be considered to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective remediation works necessary.It is my intention, following the enactment of the legislation, to carry out a public consultation on draft performance standards for domestic waste water treatment systems which will be prepared by my Department in consultation with the EPA. These standards will also include the minimum requirements for the maintenance and de-sludging of treatment systems.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	892	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 127 to 129, inclusive, together.As part of the implementation of the recommendations in the Keane Report my Department is developing a mortgage to rent scheme on a pilot basis.  This work has been assisted by ClÃºid Housing Association, a number of local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, AIB, and more recently, New Beginning and another lender.  The Keane reported recommended 2 such schemes or models on which a mortgage to rent option might operate.  The same categories of household would be targeted under each scheme.  These are households that:have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (as provided for under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears);agree to the voluntary repossession of their home;do not have significant positive equity, and;are eligible for social housing.In addition, the house must also be appropriate to household need. In other words, the household are not significantly over-accommodated (e.g. a couple residing in a home that is too large for their needs) or under-accommodated/overcrowded.  Households availing of the scheme will become social housing tenants, paying a differential rent calculated on the basis of household income.  The essential difference between the 2 options relates to ownership of the property after the voluntary repossession has taken place.Under the first model, after voluntary repossession has taken place the property would be purchased by an approved housing body at current market value.  The household would become a social housing tenant â they would no longer be homeowners.The purchase of the property would be part loan financed (using loan finance generally obtained from the initial mortgage provider) and the Exchequer.  My Department is also consulting with the Central Bank to ensure that the process through which households might be offered the option to participate in the scheme complies fully with all existing consumer protection and other regulatory requirements.Under the second model, the lender would become the long term owner of the property after voluntary repossession had taken place.  The household would become a social housing tenant of the relevant local authority and the local authority would, in turn, lease the property from the financial institution for the period of the lease.  The household would enjoy the same benefits as any household already accommodated under the social housing leasing initiative in terms of security of tenure, differential rents, eligibility etc.It is anticipated that the first transactions under the first model will take place very soon.  Ultimately, the schemes will be rolled out nationally using the criteria set out above and it is hoped that all lenders will agree to participate.

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.I am not aware of any suggestion that a new fire station will be provided in Tallaght.  In 2011, I indicated that support of â¬ 300,000 from my Department's fire services capital programme would be made available, as an exceptional measure, to supplement a similar level of funding announced by Dublin City Council to upgrade facilities at the current Tallaght fire station.  I expect this sum to be drawn down in 2012.Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority, given the current constraints on public finances.  In order to deliver cost efficiencies in line with recommendations of the Local Authority Efficiency Review Group, following the development of an agreed national fire appliance specification, a programme is currently underway which involves fire authorities aggregating demand and inviting tenders for 17 fire appliances.Further support from my Department's fire services capital programme for any fire station projects, including further upgrades in relation to Tallaght Fire Station, will be considered within the constraints of available resources and will have regard to local authorities' priorities, the value for money offered by proposals and the totality of requests from fire authorities.

Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws. Matters of compliance with competition law are proper to the Competition Authority.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011.  A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.  As one might expect, a consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed.  All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in relation to household waste collection to Government by Easter this year.  All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives.  Issues including value for money and service standards will be among the issues for consideration in this context.

The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) has been designated as the registration body for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act.Membership of the RIAI is not a prerequisite to registration and a number of non-RIAI members have already been included on the register of architects in line with the Act.A number of routes to registration are provided for in Sections 14, 15, 16 and 22 of the Act having regard to the differing approaches to gaining the requisite knowledge, skills and experience adopted by individual applicants. Section 22, in particular, includes a provision to address the position of a category of practically trained persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.   This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure.Taken in their totality the various routes to registration provided for under Part 3 of the Act represent a registration process that is open, fair and transparent.

The charge is set at â¬200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.There is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the charge. Nationwide advertising took place in both 2009 and 2010, and again in 2011, to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  Communications have also been issued to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self-assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.

As the Deputy is aware, I have set up an independent Panel to examine the problem of pyrite in private housing and I have asked the Panel to report to me early this year.  When I receive the report, I will give early and careful consideration to the Panel's findings, and will make their report available as soon as possible.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	898	The Western Development Commission's Creative West   report, published in 2009, outlined a summary of research findings and detailed a set of recommendations for developing the creative sector. The sector includes design, digital media, visual arts, architecture and crafts among others. The report provides useful information and a coherent analysis that is being used to underpin and guide the implementation of initiatives in the WDC region in order to support creative enterprises and contribute to job creation and economic development.Baseline research by the Western Development Commission estimated that there were 4,800 enterprises employing 11,000 people which generated an annual turnover of â¬534m and contributed â¬270m to the gross value added of the regional economy in 2008.In 2011 the WDC published an economic impact assessment, conducted by NUI Galway which measured the potential impact of supporting export growth and facilitating networks of practice among creative businesses in the region.  It estimated that if these activities were supported there was potential to significantly increase (by up to 17,000) the numbers working in the creative sector over the next 10 years.  In order to pursue the recommendations made in the Creative West   report and to develop the sector, the Western Development Commission has worked with partners in the region including NUI Galway and Sligo County Council to access EU funding sources for development programmes.  The Creative Edge project, which is a â¬1.2m 2-year project funded mainly by the EU under the INTERREG IVB Northern Periphery Programme, has recently been approved. Its primary objective is to develop an export platform to assist creative businesses to increase their exports, initially targeting the Diaspora. In addition, the Creative Challenge project which is a â¬300,000 2-year project mainly funded by the EU which aims to increase innovation in mainstream enterprises e.g. agrifood, tourism, life sciences has also been developed.It is hoped that these two collaborative, development programmes will go some way to supporting existing creative enterprises in the region to scale-up where appropriate, to engage in joint projects and to access international markets.  It is also hoped that new start-ups within the sector will be encouraged.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	899	The Green Schools environmental education programme, coordinated by An Taisce, has been operating very successfully in Ireland for the past 15 years.  The programme is coordinated at international level by the Foundation for Environmental Education. The Green Schools initiative provides a great opportunity for young people to learn how we can live more sustainably and protect and improve our environment. It fosters a strong sense of citizenship and leadership among students that spreads beyond the school and into their homes and the wider community. Schools are awarded Green Flags when they achieve certain targets under a number of environmental headings â waste and litter, energy, water, transport and biodiversity .   Other themes under development are Global Citizenship and Climate Change.Over 3,500 schools in Ireland are currently taking part in the programme; this represents over 84% of all schools nationally, with over 700,000 students and nearly 50,000 teachers and staff involved. To date, 2,306 schools have been awarded Green Flags.The success of the Green Schools programme is further illustrated by the demand for the programme to be extended to our post-second level institutions.  In 2010, UCC became the first third-level campus in Ireland, and the world, to be awarded a Green Flag.Alongside the central objective of raising environmental awareness, the Green Schools programme also has the added benefit of assisting participating schools in identifying and achieving cost savings.  Costs are reduced through diversion of waste from landfill, and reductions in energy and water usage.  An Taisce estimate that schools achieved a combined minimum saving of approximately â¬3 million during the 2010-2011 academic year.My Department continues to support the Green Schools and Green Campus programmes and provided funding of â¬200,000 to An Taisce for the operation of the programmes in 2011. The programmes are also supported by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, local authorities, and private sector sponsors.   My Department also supports other environmental educational initiatives, through the funding of small, local environmental projects in partnership with local authorities through the Local Agenda 21 partnership fund, for which I provided â¬395,000 in 2011. My Department has developed a primary school teachers' resource â Eco Detectives â on climate change and the environment and this was distributed to all primary schools in 2011. The Environmental Protection Agency has also developed a second-level resource entitled 2020 Vision: A Closer Look at Ireland's Environment. The theme of sustainable development is also integrated into a number of subjects in the curriculum in primary and second level schools, including geography, history, science, home economics and business.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The issue of the potential health effects of mobile phone masts was the subject of an Expert Group Report commissioned by the Government and published in March 2007. This Report, entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, is available for download on my Department's website (www.environ.ie).  The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion to date is that no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, extensive international research on the issue continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the licensing authority for the telecommunications industry, commissions audit reports to verify that its licensed operators are in compliance with their licence conditions relating to emission limits for non-ionising radiation. The detailed measurement results from over 900 transmitter sites surveyed to date have so far shown total compliance. Recorded levels of radiofrequency signals are typically measured as being within the range of 0.002% to 2% of the safe exposure levels set by the ICNIRP guidelines. This is lower or comparable to radiofrequency exposures from radio and television broadcasts. The location of licensed telecommunications antennae and the results of individualsite survey reports can be found on ComReg's website: http://www.askcomreg.ie/ mobile/siteviewer.273.LE.asp.My Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile masts or base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group, is that there is no scientific basis or evidence of adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields below ICNIRP levels. This applies irrespective of the location of the mobile phone mast.

Where vacancies arise, it is a matter for each local authority, in the first instance, to reorganise and reallocate work to meet requirements. Any exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from this Department.In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services and economic issues are given precedence as is the requirement to avoid increases in overall staffing levels.Based on a survey of local authorities I understand that all are satisfied with current staffing arrangements in relation to the Arts function.

The precise detail of this is currently being examined.The remuneration of City and County Managers is sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform and was reduced in January 2010 in accordance with Government policy on pay.There are no plans to amend the pension entitlements or remuneration of existing managers.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 140, inclusive, together.The Immigrant Investor Programme, which has been approved by the Government, will provide a portfolio of investment options for potential migrant investors. Details of these together with the broad outline on how the scheme will operate are set out in the press release issued by me on 24 January, 2012. The level of investment required in each of the options is also clearly stated in that press statement.I also indicated in my press release that the scheme will be formally launched in March when the rules, procedures, application details and so forth will be published. In advance of this, I do not propose to comment in detail on specific elements of the programme.I will say, however, that the primary purpose of this very innovative programme is either job creation or job maintenance and I am completely satisfied that it is appropriately structured with these key national objectives in focus. In that regard, I do not agree that investment in property will not have an impact on employment.  The CSO's Quarterly National Household Surveys have reported that the construction sector accounted for the largest declines in employment from Quarter 2 in 2008 through to Quarter 2 in 2011.  The sector experienced a reduction in numbers employed of 43,000 people in the period between Quarter 3 of 2009 and Quarter 3 of 2011.  During this period, the Construction Sector accounted for 56% of the overall employment drop and for more than 70% of the drop in male employment.  This has very significant economic and social consequences and in framing the Immigrant Investor Programme, I specifically stipulated that the programme should contribute to the response to the crisis in construction employment and associated professions as well as injecting some much needed funding into the sector.  Measures that stimulate demand for property, including that overhanging the market, can only be of benefit in terms of job creation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	905	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that  valid applications for certificates of naturalisation were received from the persons referred to by the Deputy in December, 2008.The applications are currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. I can inform the Deputy that good progress continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me Tipperary courthouse is owned by South Tipperary County Council.  I understand that due to its general condition it has not been used for court sittings for a number of years.The Courts Service is not in a position to fund the extensive remedial works that would be required to facilitate its return to service as a court venue and does not consider it appropriate to invest in property owned by third parties.  In view of the historical nature of building, I understand my Department indicated at the end of 2010 that it would be prepared to consider funding limited repair work to prevent further deterioration of the building.  However, no  funding was made available and, as the Deputy will appreciate, the budgetary situation in my Department has deteriorated further since 2010.  Given the need to concentrate on core activities, I regret to inform the Deputy that there is no funding available to facilitate repair work in circumstances where neither the Department nor its agencies has any vested interest in the property.

In that context the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles within each Garda Division is a matter for the Divisional Officer in the light of operational requirements.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda vehicles within each Garda District is continually monitored and reviewed by the Garda authorities to ensure that the optimum policing service is available to the community.I am further informed that there are currently 9 Garda vehicles, both marked and unmarked, assigned to  the Balbriggan Garda District which covers the areas referred to by the Deputy. In addition, the Garda authorities have advised that they are satisfied that an effective policing service is being provided, and will continue to be provided, to those areas.

Notwithstanding this reduction in Garda numbers I have been informed by the Commissioner that the Garda Traffic Corps, with the primary role of roads policing, remains in place and that the strength of the Corps, as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 947.  This represents a reduction of just over 10% in the Corps since 2009 when the strength of the Force was at an all time high.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	917	I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 158, inclusive, together.The position is that officials in the Special Investigation Unit are officers of my Department and they operate fully in accordance with national and EU legislation.  I am not aware of any widespread concern at the manner in which the SIU has carried out its work or that it has abused its powers of investigation. The investigations carried out by the SIU have formed the basis for the majority of the successful Court prosecutions taken on behalf of my Department over the past 20 years, which in itself is clear evidence of the integrity of the officials involved in the Unit and the fact that they operate in accordance with the rule of law.The investigative procedures adopted by the SIU comply with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of the person or persons being investigated.  They follow the same protocols as are used for criminal investigation carried out by the Garda.  On occasion, investigations by the Unit involve the use of search warrants, with all the rules of evidence being complied with.  Interviews are carried out under caution and statements are prepared for use in court by Counsel on behalf of the Department.  When an investigation is complete a report is prepared and forwarded to the relevant section of the Department for further action in relation to any grant payments due.A formal code of practice relating to the operations of the SIU, which codified existing guidelines, was put in place in February 2004.  While this provides that, in the first instance, complaints are dealt with through line management and, if necessary, subsequently through the Quality Service Unit, complainants also have recourse to third party bodies such as the Ombudsman's Office and, if necessary, the Courts.  Only two matters have been referred to the Department since publication of the code in 2004 and these were resolved satisfactorily within the Department.The annual costs of the operation of the Special Investigation Unit in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were as follows:YearSalaries and T and S2009â¬0.916m2010â¬0.845m2011â¬0.817mThe SIU has focused much of its energies on enforcing legislation on animal remedies, disease eradication and animal identification in respect of the small subset of those involved in the sector who attempt to profit from illegal activities. Its success in enforcing this legislation has established its value as the primary deterrent and this has resulted in a very high level of compliance in the food industry as a whole with regulatory requirements, thereby assisting in the eradication of diseases such as Brucellosis and BSE. This, in turn, has facilitated the production of high quality food and safeguarded the reputation of the Irish food industry both on the home and export markets, which is essential for continued growth. The value of the agri-food industry in 2011 was â¬22 billion and agri-food exports were worth â¬8.9 billion. It is vitally important for the continued growth of the food industry, which is so dependent on export markets, that it complies with, and is seen to comply with, national and EU regulations.I accept that many of the regulatory requirements in the animal health and food safety area are complex and my Department makes great efforts to explain and communicate these requirements to the farming sector. The relatively small number of prosecutions that come before the courts suggest that the vast majority of farmers both understand and comply with these requirements. As part of the EU CAP negotiations, I am continuing to press for greater simplification of EU regulations and requirements. I intend to continue this as the reform process continues.In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that farmers generally and others in the agri-food sector have no reason to be concerned with the activities of the SIU.  Indeed the operations of the SIU protects the interests of farmers generally and the reputation of the Irish food industry from the malpractices of the few.  I do not intend to order an independent review of the operation of the Unit, though, in common with all other areas of the Department's activities, the role and functions of the SIU will be kept under constant review.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	923	The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector. The latest data available is in respect of December 2011. This shows that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies at that time was 2,442 whole time equivalents (WTEs). The equivalent figure at the end of 2010 was 2,432 WTEs and at the end of 2009 was 2189 WTEs. This is an increase of 253 WTEs since the end of 2009.The policy goal, in line with the Implementation Plan, published in 2009 in response to the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan Report), is to achieve an overall increase of 270 social workers.   In this context, it should be noted that the HSE made provision for the recruitment of an additional 62 social workers in 2011, to build on the recruitment of over 200 additional social workers in 2010.  However, I understand from the HSE that not all of the 2011 cohort of additional staff are reflected in the employment census as yet owing to the time lag between candidates being offered positions, taking up duty and appearing in the employment census returns.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	928	General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) diagnose a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free General Medical Services.   The HSE points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples and that it significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in this regard.  I would encourage patients to follow up with the HSE if they believe they are being wrongly charged for services by their GP and the matter will be fully investigated by the Executive.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.  In a number of cases to-date, the GP has reimbursed their patients following receipt of correspondence from the HSE.I appreciate that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	929	As all persons ordinarily resident in the State may avail of public hospital services, I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the cost of providing free General Practitioner (GP) care to children up to one year of age.  In the time available, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the cost of providing a free GP service to all children under one year of age.  While the current GMS capitation rate payable to GPs in respect of children under 5 years is approximately â¬80, GPs are also entitled to a range of other payments.  These include fees for out of hours consultations which could be a significant factor in the care of young children.  In addition, GPs receive subsidies towards the cost of employing practice nurses, secretaries and practice managers, which vary depending on the number of patients on their panels.  Allowing for these additional fees and allowances, the overall cost per child could be up to â¬150 per annum.  Assuming that cost per child and an annual birth rate of between 70,000 and 75,000, the total cost of providing free GP care to all children under one year is provisionally estimated at between â¬10.5m and â¬11.5m.  I would emphasise, however, that the Deputy's proposal has not been the subject of detailed analysis and this estimate should be treated with a high degree of caution.

As these investigations are not concluded, it would be inappropriate to make any comment at this time on the matter.  On foot of a safety alert to all ambulance owners, published by the Health and Safety Authority, the National Ambulance Service has installed additional safety features, over and above the safety features already in place, on its emergency ambulance fleet, to meet the Authority's recommendations.  These additional safety features were fitted at a cost of â¬153,774.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	933	The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 in 2012.  The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.The most recent information available from the HSE indicates that, over the period from September 2011 to end-February 2012, some 3,700 health service staff will have retired from the health service.  Of this total, approximately 1,500 persons have already retired during the four-month period to the end of December 2011, while the remainder have indicated that they will leave by the end of February 2012.  It should be noted that these figures refer to the number of individuals rather than whole-time equivalents (WTE).  It should also be noted that this data is subject to change in the event of additional applications being received or existing applications being withdrawn.The health and personal social services that will be delivered by the HSE within its budget and anticipated staff complement are set out in the National Service Plan for 2012, which I approved on 13 January.  It is clear that the cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  It increases the need for reform including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters as well as redeployment.  The Service Plan includes a commitment to addressing these issues within the context of the Public Service Agreement.  It also commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reducing financial and human resources.  The Plan reflects the need to move to new models of care across all service areas which will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the least possible cost.Other reform initiatives set out in the Plan include the development of proposals to protect the viability of community nursing units and to increase the intermediate care capacity for older people; a significant strengthening of primary care services; the enhancement of community mental health teams; a more tailored approach to disability services; and progression of the clinical care programmes.  I intend to review the Service Plan once the full impact of the staff leaving at the end of the 29 February "grace period" is known.  In advance of this, I have asked the HSE Board to submit as a matter of urgency its assessment of the likely impact of retirements to the end of February, to identify particular pressure points and to develop appropriate measures to deal with significant departures in a given service or area.The HSE is currently finalising detailed service plans at regional level and these regional plans will take account of the effect of the current reduction in staff numbers.

A project leader and an Advisory Group were appointed last November to progress the development of a proposal.  The Advisory Group comprises representatives of my Department, the Health Service Executive, Medical Council, Post Graduate Forum and student doctors in specialist training.  A draft Interim Report was provided to me yesterday 31 January 2012.  The draft report contains a number of recommendations which I will consider before the report is finalised.  It is envisaged that consultation with relevant stakeholders would then take place.  I trust the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to answer the specific questions raised by him at this time.

Cannabis misuse is detrimental to health, and significant physical and mental health risks are particularly associated with long-term use.  The Government is satisfied that the existing controls associated with cannabis are appropriate.As the law currently stands, it is not possible for cannabis-based medicinal products to be prescribed by a medical practitioner in Ireland.  I am aware that claims have been made in respect of the possible health benefits of cannabis-based medicinal products for patients suffering from certain conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis. I am also aware that cannabis-based medicinal products may be legally prescribed in other countries.  Accordingly, my Department is examining the issues associated with applying controls, similar to those that apply to other controlled drugs that can be misused, such as morphine and methadone, to cannabis-based medicinal products to permit them to be prescribed and dispensed in Ireland.

Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  There will be an announcement in due course about the start date for the new arrangements.  It is hoped that the new arrangements will be in place by early summer.

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

Licence categories were then changed, with separate categories covering car (Category B) and car and trailer (Category EB).  People licensed to drive with trailer before 1989 were allowed to keep their old entitlements, simply by ticking the appropriate box on the application form when renewing their licences.  Where a pre-1989 licence holder did not tick the box they would no longer retain that entitlement.  However, the entitlement could be restored up to ten years after last holding it.  If they let the entitlement to drive with a trailer lapse for longer, they must apply as learners for the purposes of driving with a trailer.The problems this system has caused for some people have been raised before with me.  I have considered the issue, and I believe it is of the utmost importance, from a safety perspective, that people are properly qualified and licensed to drive the vehicles they have charge of on our roads.  However, I have decided to change the licensing regulations so that those who have a Category B licence, and who wish to acquire a Category EB licence, will now no longer have to wait the usual 6 months before they can take the Category EB test.  This change came into effect as of 10 January 2012.  I do not propose any further legislative changes in this regard.
