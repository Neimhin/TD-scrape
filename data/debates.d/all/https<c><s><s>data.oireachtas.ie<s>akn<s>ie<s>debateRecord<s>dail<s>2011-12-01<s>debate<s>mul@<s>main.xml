          <p eId="para_1">I intend raising the issue of the Diocese of Raphoe on the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">I have a question regarding the unemployment figures published yesterday.  The Tánaiste said on 6 October 2011, "There has been a significant reduction in unemployment.  The jobs initiative is working, both in respect of reducing the number of people who are unemployed and creating jobs."  Does he accept that yesterday's figures show a year on year increase of 4,500 people on the live register and that his policies are not working?  A closer inspection of the figures shows an increase of 9,500 people over 25 years of age and a decrease in those under 25 years of age of nearly 5,000 which is explained by the extraordinary migration of young people in recent months which everybody in the country knows about.  This means the real rate of the rise in unemployment far exceeds the headline figure we were given yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The Government has been in power for nine months.  The Tánaiste talks about unemployment and he talked about a jobs budget and all we got was a paltry jobs initiative that was really just an excuse for a raid on pension funds of pensioners to fund and bolster the coffers of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">Yesterday's figures show that unemployment is the single biggest problem this country faces now.  The single biggest challenge we have to address is how to get people back to work. This must be the focus for everyone and this is at the centre of every single decision which the Government has made, is making and will make.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">I expect it to be reflected in the statements on the budget which will be made next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">We have sought ways to deal with this challenge by introducing a jobs initiative in May.  As recently as last week, we held a special Cabinet meeting on the whole issue of employment, arising from which a number of measures were announced such as the establishment of funds which will provide for the extension of credit and the availability of credit to small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, and for start-up businesses, in order to generate employment.  We convened a global Irish economic forum, the purpose of which was to bring together people from the Irish Diaspora in order to help restore the country's reputation and to attract investment into this country.  We have established the strategic investment fund which was a commitment we made prior to the establishment of the Government, the purpose of which is, again, to make money available in order to generate employment.  We have established the new economic and recovery authority under which the semi-State agencies will operate because they have a key role in the development of employment and the encouragement of investment.  I expect that the Budget Statements next week will reflect the top priority which this Government is giving to getting people back to work and to generating employment.</p>

On 30 June 2010, he asked, "When will the Government take seriously the issues of unemployment and getting people back to work?"

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_49">We have 448,600 people out of work and the Tánaiste states unemployment is the Government's top priority as a policy issue.  Heaven help us if this is the Government working to put jobs first.  Figures published yesterday show an unemployment rate of 14.5% and a shocking increase in poverty levels.  Some 22.5% of people reported that they live in deprivation, which means being unable to afford a warm coat, struggling to heat one's home and so forth.  This reality seems to be lost on the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who I do not see in the Chamber.  Perhaps he is on a weekend break.  In a very brash and unacceptable manner the Minister told the population at large to cheer up and take a vacation, although he may be really telling them to take a hike.  Do his comments reflect a disposition among Government members that everything is okay?</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Will the Tánaiste tell the almost half a million people who are out of work that he is genuinely different?  I hear the same rhetoric we heard previously, and not only from this Government, about lending to small and medium sized businesses increasing.  The Tánaiste indicated that employment is the Government's priority, whereas the evidence shows that the misery continues and most of those who are out of work do not see prospects of securing a job.  They see the Tánaiste's Administration as a carbon copy of the previous Government.</p>

Let us also have a real commitment from the Tánaiste that the unemployed and those living in poverty will be front and centre in the Government's proposals in next week's budget.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_53">Tourism is among the responsibilities of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I understand that while attending a tourism event yesterday, he made some remarks which were aimed at encouraging domestic tourism.  This is what he does; it is part of his job.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Deputy McDonald asked me whether the Government believes everything is okay.  We do not believe everything is okay.  When we came into office we inherited a country that was broken.  Its public finances and banks and the morale of its people are broken and we have a huge problem of unemployment.  Large numbers of people are out of work which, in turn, is related to the major problems the Deputy described in respect of people who are living in poverty or at risk of poverty.  The Government is determined to deal with this issue.  At the centre of doing so must be getting people back into employment and securing jobs and investment.  We have been pursuing several strategies to achieve this objective.  First, to secure investment we have had to restore the country's reputation and I believe we have made a significant advance in this regard.  We have had to communicate to potential investors outside the country who are contemplating investing here that this is a good country in which to invest and we are succeeding in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Second, we have to get the domestic economy moving again.  One of the major problems we have had for some time in the domestic economy has been the difficulty experienced by businesses in accessing finance and capital, in particular people who are starting up a business.  The Government is addressing both of these issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_96">I would like to raise the plight of a cohort of people in this city and this State.  We have not heard about them for many months.  They are being overlooked because they are ordinary working-class people who do not have the resources to hire expensive lawyers or make large donations to the political establishment.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 families and individuals were badly burned when a bills payment company, Home Payments Limited, went into liquidation last August.  The Tánaiste may be aware of people with low or medium-sized incomes who made regular payments to this company so they would have funds in readiness to pay their routine utility bills, such as those for gas and electricity, on time.  Some families used the company to save for future costs like children's schoolbooks and uniforms, the costs associated with their children going to college, or the cost of medical and dental treatment.  At this time of the year, it is worth remembering that many families used Home Payments Limited as a savings bank to budget for Christmas-related expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The families and individuals who have been badly burned by the collapse of this company have lost hundreds or thousands of euro — up to €10,000, in some cases.  Such a loss would not be noticed by former Ministers who receive pensions of €150,000 a year, or serving bankers who are paid €500,000 a year.  It is an absolute fortune for an ordinary family, however, as it represents a huge saving and sacrifice.  Ordinary people have been burned because this company scandalously succumbed to the siren call of the property market and speculated in it.  They will lose much of what they had on deposit because the company is in liquidation.  I have been told by the liquidator that there will not be a settlement until well into next year, if at all.  Even though it was not required to do so, four weeks ago the Government gave €700 million to speculators in Anglo Irish Bank to make good their bad debts.  With three weeks to go to Christmas, will the Government establish an emergency compensation fund for the victims of this company?  The Tánaiste is aware that the State has quite rightly compensated the victims of floods and storms, etc., in the past.  This collapse of this company is as much of a blow to these individuals and families as a storm or a flood.  Will the Government establish an emergency fund now to ensure these people do not suffer unduly this Christmas?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_591">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_592">That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the draft scheme entitled Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2011, a copy of which draft scheme was laid before Dáil Éireann on 28 November 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This year has been a significant one for the Irish banking sector.  The financial measures programme, FMP, announced on 31 March last by the Central Bank was a rigorous analysis of the capital and liquidity requirements of the domestic banks and formed the backdrop against which the Government announced proposals to comprehensively restructure and reform the banking sector.  These proposals represented a benchmark in the process of reorganising and strengthening credit institutions in Ireland and were a necessary follow-up to the decision to accept assistance from the external partners in November 2010, and to carry out the consequential adjustment programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Given the main role played by the weakness in our financial system in bringing about the need for external intervention, it was vital to quickly address this issue.  This has and is being done through a number of actions, in particular, by requiring an increase in bank capital sufficient to ensure adequate capitalisation based on conservative and rigorous assumptions about future requirements; by initiating a sizeable de-leveraging of the banks concerned through the amortisation and sale of non-core assets, with the intention of achieving a more prudent loan-to-deposit ratio; by creating a domestic banking system centred around two universal, pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland; and by focusing on a drive to meet bank funding requirements, both in terms of deposits and issuance of debt securities.  It is in this latter context that the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee, or ELG, scheme remains of crucial importance, and so I would like to turn to the motion before the House to approve the draft statutory instrument entitled the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">As the House is aware, the ELG scheme, which was introduced in December 2009, provides a Government guarantee in respect of certain liabilities of a number of credit institutions in Ireland.  Given its nature, the scheme is time limited so that any prolongation requires that the scheme be amended periodically, and this must be done by bringing a motion before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support), or CIFS, Act 2008, as amended.  As matters stand, the ELG scheme would expire at the end of December of this year in the absence of a prolongation.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The statutory instrument contains two necessary amendments.  Item 1 amends paragraph 3.1(<i>b</i>) of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the period within which institutions may apply to join it.  This amendment seeks to extend the application period by replacing 31 December 2011, with 31 December 2012, to reflect the one-year time extension to the scheme in law.  Item 2 amends paragraph 2.1 (<i>c</i>)(ii) of the Schedule to the scheme which sets out the temporary criteria which a liability must meet to be considered eligible.  This amendment seeks to replace the current end date of 31 December 2011, by which eligible liabilities must be incurred if they are to be guaranteed, with a new date in national law of 31 December 2012.  Both amendments are subject to the continuing approval of the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">This conditionality arises because all banking guarantee schemes are subject to EU state aid rules and these rules provide in practice that schemes be approved for a maximum period of six months in advance.  Therefore the ELG scheme will remain subject to six-monthly Commission approval, notwithstanding the proposed one year extension in national law.  This necessary approval has already been sought from the Commission and is expected to be formally given within a matter of days.  Once given, this will mean explicit EU approval for the scheme until 30 June 2012, that is, for the next six months, in line with existing practice.  Further state aid approval could then be sought before this date in order to cover the final six months of the scheme's extension to the end of December 2012 if this is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">It is also necessary to seek the views of the European Central Bank in these matters and the ECB has already given a favourable opinion on the proposed prolongation of the scheme, stating that: "Taking into account financial stability considerations, a further extension of the ELG scheme would be beneficial".  The views of the relevant Irish authorities, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which are fundamental in any assessment of the future of the scheme, are also supportive of its extension.  I shall return to this matter later.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I shall now give some detail on the scheme and on the <i>raison d’être</i> for its proposed continuation.  The scheme, as I already mentioned, commenced in December 2009.  It was effectively a successor to the credit institutions financial support, CIFS, scheme, although both schemes co-existed for a period until the expiry of that scheme on 29 September 2010.  The ELG scheme is more focused than its predecessor and covers both a narrower range and smaller amount of liabilities.  The scheme covers eligible liabilities as defined in paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the scheme.  These liabilities can be summarised as consisting of certain deposits and various unsecured debt securities.  As retail deposits of up to €100,000 are already covered under another scheme, the deposit guarantee scheme, the ELG scheme only covers sums above this figure in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The credit institutions which are part of the ELG scheme are described as the "participating institutions".  They are, principally, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life &amp; Permanent and the IBRC or Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, and their subsidiaries, including the EBS.  The full list is published on the NTMA website.  Participating institutions may take deposits and issue debt, with a maximum maturity date of five years, during the so-called issuance period which runs from the date the institutions joined the scheme to the end date of the scheme, currently 31 December 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">At present, some €100 billion in eligible liabilities are covered under the ELG scheme, compared with liabilities of €375 billion at the beginning of the CIFS scheme.  Later, in mid-2010, a combined figure of €256 billion was guaranteed by both schemes when they overlapped and just before the CIFS scheme expired.  After this expiry, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, the amount guaranteed under the ELG scheme alone was €147 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The decrease in these eligible liabilities figures from €256 billion to €147 billion and, later, to the €100 billion figure mentioned, reflects a number of factors.  These were, principally, the non-renewal of some senior unsecured debt and deposits which matured under the CIFS scheme; second, a "fall-out" of those liabilities — asset covered securities and dated subordinated debt — which were not eligible to be covered under the ELG scheme; and, third, there were the turbulent market conditions and negative sentiment that prevailed about the financial system in Ireland in 2010, which resulted in large outflows of corporate deposits from the institutions in the latter half of that year.  However, this year the rate of deposit outflows from the institutions has slowed significantly and the level of deposits since mid-year has been steady.  Nevertheless, the market remains fragile and it is imperative that no action be taken that would cause any negative movement in deposits which remain so important as a funding source for Irish credit institutions in the absence of conditions that would allow normal debt issuance by the participating institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">It is against this background that the Central Bank has advised of the necessity to continue and extend the ELG scheme until 30 June next, in line with the EU six monthly approval period, while also agreeing with the extension of the scheme in national law until 31 December 2012.  The operator of the scheme, the NTMA, has also confirmed that an extension is advisable.  The consensus of the authorities is that in a market where there is little opportunity for Irish banks to issue debt or paper and where depositors, especially the public, still need to be reassured that both bank funding and their deposits remain secure, the need for the continuation of the scheme is beyond question.  Moreover, the extension of the scheme complements the financial measures programme announced in March as it was assumed by the Central Bank, in the context of the prudential capital assessment review, that the ELG would remain in place during 2012 and 2013, subject to EU approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Of course, since the Minister for Finance, and thus the State, is guarantor for all eligible liabilities under the ELG scheme, there must be a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the provision of the guarantee and therefore the participating institutions must pay a significant fee to the Exchequer.  The fee structure is set down under recommendations which apply to all EU banking guarantee schemes and which are based on first, recommendations dated 20 October 2008 of the governing council of the European Central Bank on government guarantees for bank debt and, second, on subsequent recommendations from the EU Commission set out in a DG Competition staff working paper, dated 30 April 2010, which apply state aid rules to government guarantee schemes concerning bank debt issued after 30 June 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The outcome of the Commission recommendations was a staggered increase in fees payable in respect of new issuances in the second half of 2010, in accordance with the maturity of the debt concerned and the credit rating of the institutions involved.  In a nutshell, the fee structure is aimed at encouraging banks to move away from dependency on short-term funding, in particular that less than three months in duration.  Consequently, for debt or deposits issued today which fall into this category, the guarantee fee is 160 basis points, excluding retail deposits which attract a fee of 90 basis points.  All debt and deposits with a maturity of between three months and one year attract a fee of 90 basis points also.  For longer-maturity debt, the fee is between 126.5 and 134.5 basis points.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The consequences of the revised pricing structure are that the level of fees earned by the Exchequer has increased.  As a result, participating institutions are now paying an average of some 100 basis points compared with the 50 basis points for short-term debt that was charged at the beginning of the scheme.  In monetary terms, about €1.8 billion in fees have been paid to date under the ELG scheme of which more than half, or €947 million, has been incurred in the first three quarters of 2011, compared with €855 million for all of 2010.  A new Commission fee structure is expected to be in operation in 2012 which will leave fees unchanged for debt of less than one year's maturity while resulting in some small decrease initially for debt of longer maturity.  The fee structure may be revisited in the future if member states were to reach agreement on so-called pooling arrangements for EU-wide guarantees of bank liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Earlier I mentioned the two specific amendments to the scheme before the House that are necessary to extend the scheme in law.  For the further information of the House, however, I should mention in passing that there are also two amending orders of a consequential technical nature which will have to be made if the statutory instrument amending the scheme is passed by this House.  These are called financial support orders and will be made in exercise of the powers that are conferred on the Minister for Finance under section 6(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 or CIFS Act.  These orders do not have to be brought before the House as they are not part of the proposed amendment to the scheme but are supplementary to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The first order specifies the issuance period during which financial support, that is, the Government guarantee, may continue to be given, in accordance with section 6(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support), CIFS, Act, in respect of eligible liabilities incurred under the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme. Effectively, this allows the current end-date of the scheme of 31 December 2011 to be extended to 30 June 2012 for the purposes of allowing the guarantee to continue to apply to eligible liabilities incurred.  The new issuance period will therefore run from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012, that is, the period approved by the Commission under state aid rules.  It replaces the existing issuance period which runs from 1 July to 31 December 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The second order sets down the end-date for financial support in accordance with section 6(3)(<i>b</i>) of the CIFS Act 2008, which allows the Minister for Finance to specify the date beyond which such support cannot be given. This date will now be extended to 30 June 2017 instead of the current date of 31 December 2016.  This is to deal with those liabilities under the ELG scheme which may have a maturity of up to five years and which would therefore have to be guaranteed even if the scheme itself were to expire on 30 June 2012.  In this way, for example, a depositor who has made a fixed-term five year deposit with an institution on, say, 31 May 2012 would enjoy a guarantee of the sum involved up until 31 May 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Notwithstanding the overarching need to extend the ELG scheme for an additional period, I should mention here a positive development in this area, namely, the recent indications that there may be some demand in the near future for non-guaranteed deposits from the participating institutions.  This was shown by the request, made in accordance with paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the ELG scheme, from these institutions to be allowed to offer unguaranteed deposits to certain corporate and institutional customers.  I responded positively to this request by publishing the necessary technical notice on 16 November last, a notice which allowed such offers to be made subject to certain conditions, which made clear that unguaranteed deposits had to be clearly labelled as such and that they were not open to normal retail depositors as defined in the rules of the scheme.  It was also made explicit in the notice that guaranteed deposits were unaffected by the new development.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The fact that a request to be permitted to offer unguaranteed deposits has been made by the participating institutions is a positive sign that may yet be seen as one of the first steps in removing the necessity for the maintenance of the guarantee but I will not exaggerate the position.  It is likely that internationally, especially in the European Union, market conditions will have to improve substantially before the issue of Irish bank unguaranteed paper can become significant.  Nevertheless, a recommencement of the substantial downward trend in Irish Government bond yields on the secondary market evident since July until quite recently could help move sentiment in the direction of unguaranteed bank paper also.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">In summing up, it would in truth be preferable if there were no need to bring this statutory instrument before the House today since such a situation would infer that a guarantee for bank liabilities was no longer required.  That this is not the case is a fact of financial life, however, and we must accept it for the present.  Nevertheless, the need for a bank guarantee is kept under review and the requirement to obtain formal EU state aid approval every six months is a continuing obligation that ensures that the ELG scheme will be extended only as necessary and only after the reviews of all the relevant authorities are taken into account.  In the meantime, present market conditions and the need to safeguard the stability of bank liabilities in a turbulent market on the one hand while, at the same time, giving comfort to providers of such funding on the other hand mean that the ELG scheme must be extended.  The position will be reviewed in advance of the 30 June 2012 date in accordance with the existing state aid approval schedule.  I commend the scheme to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_613">I wish to share time with Deputy Kelleher.  I will take ten minutes and Deputy Kelleher will take the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">This debate is taking place against an extraordinary backdrop of uncertainty and fear.  My party will be supporting the motion before the House.  I do not believe we have any choice as a country.  The consequences of ending the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme at this time would be extremely serious.  It would inevitably result in a deposit flight from Ireland and our banks would suffer devastating consequences as a result.  At this time investors, the markets and the international community are very sensitive to any policy shift, however minor it might appear to be, but ending the ELG at this time would be a fundamental shift of policy and would certainly result in changed behaviour in terms of where deposits are being based.  In that context and against that backdrop it is important that the motion before us is supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I will not spend time discussing the politics of this; it got a good airing on the Order of Business and I am sure it will again later in the debate.  It is fine when in opposition to discard the advice of the National Treasury Management Agency and the Governor of the Central Bank, as the then Opposition parties did in December 2009 when the ELG scheme was first introduced by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  In September 2010, when the ELG scheme was being extended for a further year to the end of 2011 and the amount being guaranteed under the ELG scheme had been substantially reduced from the CIFS scheme down to €147 billion, it was again opposed by Fine Gael and Labour.  They are now proposing an extension of the same guarantee substantially on the same grounds set out by the then Minister in late 2010 for it to be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">We must acknowledge that people are very fearful about the security of their deposits.  When they watch the news every night and hear political leaders in the European Union talking about having days or weeks to save the euro it sends shivers down the spine in terms of the safety of their money.  Along with many other Deputies, I am sure, I am taking telephone calls from very concerned constituents who are worried as to what they should do with their money.  We all want to advise them that the euro is safe, that the Irish banks are safe, that there is a guarantee in place, and that there is no risk whatsoever but that advice is undermined by what they are hearing every night on the news.  It is essential that finality to the greatest extent possible is brought to this crisis at next week's European Council summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In that regard I welcome the co-ordinated intervention yesterday by the main central banks across the globe — the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada and the United States Federal Reserve — in making unlimited US dollars available to European banks.  That in itself should be a precursor to a far more aggressive government bond buying programme by the ECB.  It has been speculated that the ECB would target a limit on government bond yields or on the spread between the interest rate on German and other government bonds.  That would be a significant boost to confidence in the wider market.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The fact that the central banks have moved ahead of the politicians is in itself instructive.  As well as providing help for banks, the co-ordinated action sends a signal that the central banks will not wait on political instruction before they act.  That is implicitly acknowledged in the statement by the Bank of Japan, for example, which stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_619">There is ... a possibility that Japan will be adversely affected, should conditions in global financial markets deteriorate further.  The Bank of Japan will continue to maintain financial market stability in close co-operation with other central banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Given the endless rounds of crisis meetings and summits we have had at European level in recent months it is reassuring to know that we are not depending exclusively on the outcome of any negotiations at Franco-German level to design a solution to this crisis.  Next week's summit will be of critical importance and I hope next week will mark another milestone in terms of the interest rate being charged by the ECB, which could provide some easing of the burden for tracker mortgage holders and, hopefully, variable mortgage holders, if the governing Council decides to reduce the main interest rate further at next week's governing Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The extension of the ELG scheme is the correct decision for the Minister to make.  The banks are still rebuilding their deposit base and that process would be quickly put into reverse if the guarantee were suddenly withdrawn.  The risk of deposit flight is certainly real and substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">To put this in context, I have been looking at some numbers going back over the last few years.  Total deposits at the six covered institutions came to €425 billion at the end of 2008.  By the end of March this year, when the financial measures report was published, that figure had fallen to €311 billion.  The most significant move in the banks' deposit base was in their non-domestic deposits, which collapsed from €196 billion to €76 billion; a fall of €120 billion.  Domestic deposits had actually increased over the period from €229 billion to €235 billion.  This showed that in terms of stabilising domestic deposits, the guarantee had broadly worked, but the banks' ability to attract funds from outside the domestic economy evaporated over that period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The banks have made up this loss of deposits via an increase in reliance on central bank liquidity, both from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB.   At the end of March, the banks had borrowed €180 billion from this channel.  This is ultimately not a sustainable situation.  The ECB simply will not term fund the Irish banking sector, and the need for the Irish banks to attract further deposits, while carefully reducing their loan books, is the biggest challenge facing them.  At the same time, we are demanding of them that they meet the credit needs of the economy.  They have a very difficult challenge to meet in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The timetable on the deleveraging of the banks' balance sheets, set out in the memorandum of understanding with the ECB and the IMF, needs to be revisited and renegotiated.  Forcing them to carry out deleveraging in the manner agreed will be unhelpful and is inconsistent with the requirement that we all want them to fulfil, in terms of meeting the domestic needs of the economy.  In respect of the sale of the non-core assets and the rebuilding of the banks' loan to deposit ratios, the Minister should consult with the Central Bank, examine the terms of the MOU and seek to renegotiate a lengthening of the time for the banks to meet those criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The banks are making some progress in this regard, which is welcome.  Bank of Ireland reported an increase of 3% in deposits in the three months to the end of October.  The covered banks have reduced their dependence on Central Bank funding to a total of €148.6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The State has become quite dependent on the level of fees being paid by the banks on foot of the ELG.  The Minister acknowledged the figures in his own contribution.  The State has received €1.8 billion under the ELG since it was introduced in December 2009.  It received €969 million to end of October in the Exchequer returns.  That is more than three times the receipts that the State received over that time from CAT or CGT.  It is effectively becoming a new form of stamp duty.  When the ELG eventually ends, there will be a hole in the public finances.  If the ELG had ended this year and the fees were not paid, it would have been to the tune of €1 billion.  As the banks are weaned off the guarantee, this money will be available to the banks to offer more attractive deposit rates or to improve their profitability.  The corollary of this is that in time, the income will be lost to the State and the Minister will need to plug the gap in the State finances.  I am sure he is well aware of that.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_627">I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue in the House.  The extension of the guarantee scheme for another year was originally announced as a press release in the dark hours of the morning from the Department of Finance.  Deputy McGrath has outlined the technical reasons behind it and the importance of this scheme in rebuilding confidence in the banking system.  The way it has been announced is an indication that there is much disquiet in Government circles, as it has had to do a <i>volte-face</i> of major proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">This debate has been ongoing since September 2008 and it has been a big political football.  I accept that there is cut and thrust in politics, but given that this Government has decided to extend the guarantee, in view of all that was said by the Government parties when they were in opposition, it shows that the right decision was made from the start.  We had to make sure that we had a functioning banking system and that we were able to build confidence in that system in Ireland, admittedly in a different scenario, following the winding down of Anglo Irish Bank, its amalgamation of deposits with AIB and the restructuring announced in March by the Minister.  The announcement by the Minister was indicated by the previous Minister for Finance, who said just before the election that due to the major decisions which had to be made on restructuring the banks, it would be more appropriate for the new Government to make them, rather than the outgoing Government which was vacating office.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">This has been a very expensive exercise for taxpayers, but equally it had to be done and it is critically important that we have honest debate in this Chamber on how we deal with the banking system.  As Deputy McGrath outlined, it is becoming a source of revenue for the Government to be used in current expenditure this year and next year.  While the then Opposition opposed the decision tooth and nail, it has been very quick to spend the money that the scheme has generated now that it is in Government.  I have been in this House for nearly 20 years and this is one of the most breathtaking U-turns I have ever seen.  The then Opposition vilified anybody who supported the guarantee in those very difficult times in 2008, when this country was on its knees and a tough decision had to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Does the Minister actually have confidence in the Governor of the Central Bank?  When in Opposition, the Government parties said it was one of the worst decisions ever made, yet Professor Honohan's report quite clearly states that a broad guarantee had to be delivered on that night to ensure the survival of the banking system in Ireland and to ensure that we did not have a meltdown of the Irish economy in 2008.  The Labour Party in opposition campaigned vehemently against that proposal and against the idea that we saddle the taxpayers with huge burdens.  We did this, but we did it for the right reasons, when we made a very difficult decision to secure and guarantee debt of bondholders and depositors at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">We then heard all about burning bondholders.  It was to be Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.  Quite clearly, nothing has happened in that respect.  I raise these issues because it shows the absolute hypocrisy in the space of ten months.  When he was in opposition, Deputy Shatter was constantly accusing the previous Government of not jailing bankers.  We assumed that when he became Minister for Justice and Equality, there would be funeral pyres outside Dublin Castle, with bankers and bondholders being burned daily.  Nothing has happened.  It is very easy to stand on this side of the House and cast aspersions on the integrity of individuals on the other side of the House when they are making very difficult decisions.  I am obliged to highlight the absolute hypocrisy of senior Ministers, when we remember what they said from this side of the House and when they were running around the country last February.  I do not like saying this, but it must be said, because it was very dishonest campaigning to say the least.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_632">I would like to read some comments into the record:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_633">The amendment before us this morning is the recommencement of the bank guarantee of billions in the name of Irish taxpayers...It provides for the roll-over of the bank guarantee...The Minister is asking the taxpayer to provide yet another line of defence for the banking system...[Next week when the Government will announce €3.8 billion of] cuts in welfare and elsewhere, it will be to meet the higher interest charges Ireland has to pay on an increased national debt because of the incompetent way the bank guarantee was cooked up and then handled...The critical issue to be addressed is whether the banks have changed sufficiently to warrant the taxpayers dipping into their collective pocket once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">These are not my words; they are the words of Deputies Joan Burton and Richard Bruton taken from their speeches to the House on 3 December 2009.  The Dáil was debating the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme that day.  This is the same scheme that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are seeking to extend today.  Both parties, then in opposition, argued strongly about the new banking guarantee and both voted against the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Nine months later on 29 September 2010, when Fianna Fáil sought to extend the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme for a further six months, the Fine Gael and Labour Party opposition to the scheme remained steadfast.  Deputy Joan Burton described the extension as a vote of confidence in the Government's banking strategy, firmly stating that the Labour Party does not do blank cheques.  Deputy Michael Noonan, while supporting the principle of the extension, voted against it on the grounds that it would continue to provide cover for Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">How the times have changed.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against the ELG scheme in 2009 and against its extension in 2010.  Nevertheless, today we are being asked by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to extend the bank guarantee not for a further six months but for 12 months.  We are being asked to saddle the State and its taxpayers with an unknown liability on top of the existing guarantee of €100 billion.  We are being asked to write a blank cheque for the banks, including Anglo Irish Bank.  Given the volatility in the eurozone it is likely that the scale of this liability will increase in the coming 12 months.  Given the risk to the State and the taxpayer of the bank guarantee this represents the greatest and most expensive political U-turn in the history of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Minister will be aware that the move today does not mark the beginning of the U-turn.  That sad event took place behind closed doors in Government Buildings in June of this year when the Cabinet, including the Ministers, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Joan Burton, Deputy Richard Bruton and others agreed to extend the bank guarantee until the end of 2011.  However, today, unlike in June, every member of the Government and its backbenchers must vote on whether they wish to breathe a further 12 months of life into what is universally regarded as the most costly and the most damaging decision ever taken by an Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The scale of that U-turn is breathtaking given the depth of opposition to the bank guarantee, especially from the Labour Party.  If there were one decision that represents the Labour Party's capitulation to the failed policies of Fianna Fáil it would be this one.  So much for not writing blank cheques for failed banks.  Naturally, those in the Labour Party, stung by the exposure of this complete U-turn, will attempt to deflect attention from its bad decisions.  They will allege that they alone stood against the blanket guarantee in 2008 and that they alone had the courage to stand up to Fianna Fáil at the time.  Naturally, this is not true but they have repeated it so many times that it is possible they now genuinely believe it to be true.  The Dáil record shows and tells a different story.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Let me set the record straight.  At the end of September 2008 there was widespread fear that a run on Irish banks was imminent, that our banking system was at risk of collapse and that many small depositors would be burnt.  Many credible economists and commentators argued for a time-limited guarantee of deposits and liabilities of banks of systemic importance to serve as an emergency measure.  Fianna Fáil, acting under pressure from the ECB which advocated not letting any bank fail, introduced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill on 30 September 2008.  The Bill empowered the Minister to produce a financial support scheme to provide a guarantee for Irish banks which would be presented for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Sinn Féin gave conditional support to the Bill.  We criticised its lack of detail and called for specific protections to be provided for the taxpayer.  We argued for tougher regulation of the banks.  We stated that any bank in receipt of State support should assist struggling mortgage holders in distress.  We called for a specific levy to be applied to covered institutions.  We made it clear that we would only support the scheme if our substantive concerns were met in the secondary legislation.  Many of these concerns were echoed in the contributions to the debate made by the Labour Party, including that of the then finance spokesperson, the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Two weeks later the Government brought forward the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme to the Dáil.  It met none of the tests set down by Sinn Féin during the debate on the enabling legislation.  Rather it provided for a guarantee so expansive and comprehensive that anyone with an ounce of sense could see that the level of risk to the State and the taxpayer was unacceptable.  Sinn Féin voted against the scheme on that basis.  This is not an academic point.  As the Minister is aware, the blanket guarantee only came into legal effect after the passing of the scheme by the Oireachtas on 17 October 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Dáil record clearly shows that Sinn Féin and the Labour Party were the only parties to vote against the scheme.  The first banks to join the scheme did so on 24 October.  The Minister of Finance confirmed as much in a reply to a parliamentary question from me on 8 November this year.  This is on the Dáil record.  Sinn Féin opposed the blanket guarantee then and we have done so consistently since.  To suggest that Sinn Féin supported the blanket banking guarantee introduced by Fianna Fáil is a lie casually thrown about to distract attention from the facts and not supported by the Dáil record.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Perhaps some of the Labour Party Deputies and backbenchers will not accept my word for it but I suggest they would accept the word of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in a reply to a parliamentary question on 8 November 2011 in which he stated that "The formal statutory legal basis for the guarantee was provided by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 and the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008", known as the CIFS, which were formally approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 October 2008.  The Dáil record shows that Sinn Féin voted against the scheme but, more important, the decision on 17 October 2008 by Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Fine Gael to saddle the State and the taxpayer with a liability running into hundreds of billions of euro had consequences more profound and long lasting than any politician or economist could have predicted at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Throughout 2009, Sinn Féin and the Labour Party continued to oppose the bank guarantee.  When the Government brought the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme before the Dáil in December 2009 both parties rightly saw it as a mechanism to further extend the disastrous decisions of 2008.  Deputy Joan Burton was right to suggest that supporting the ELG scheme was akin to voting confidence in Fianna Fáil's failed banking strategy.  She was right to describe the ELG scheme extension as a blank cheque that would be used by the Government to increase the risk to the State and the taxpayer.  Deputy Richard Bruton was right to withhold support from the ELG scheme on the grounds that the banks were not doing enough to help foster lending in the economy and to change their greed-driven culture.  When Fianna Fáil came back again in June 2010 seeking to extend the ELG scheme for a further six months, Deputy Joan Burton rightly criticised the Government for having no exit strategy from the banking guarantee while Deputy Bruton rightly questioned the inclusion of Anglo Irish Bank into any support scheme.  With such a strong and vocal record of opposition to the ELG scheme by Fine Gael and the Labour Party one might believe that upon taking office they would have set about developing an exit strategy from this toxic debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">However, at a Cabinet meeting in June this year Fine Gael and the Labour Party abandoned two years of principle and adopted wholesale the failed banking policy of their predecessors.  Worse, today they seek a 12-month extension of this failed guarantee.  The Minister's arguments and those of Fine Gael and the Labour Party are no different from those presented by the late Brian Lenihan in 2008 and by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív on his behalf in 2009.  There are no new justifications for saddling the State and the taxpayer with the additional risks that will arise from today's decision.  This represents another blank cheque written by a Government in hock to the Irish banking system and the European Central Bank and has little or no regard for the consequences for ordinary working people.  Clearly, the Labour Party writes blank cheques when Fine Gael asks it to do so.  It seems an apt, if depressing, description of everything that is wrong with this coalition and the Labour Party's participation in it.  Sinn Féin will oppose the proposed extension to the bank guarantee scheme today, as we have consistently done since October 2008.  We will do so because it is the right and honest thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I want to make it clear to every Government backbencher that today it has asked us to write another blank cheque for the banks, including Anglo Irish Bank.  It is asking us to give Government guarantees to unsecured private banking debt, a sum we will not know.  We are asked to do this at a time of uncertainty and volatility in the banking system which will increase the level of risk to the taxpayer.  Unlike others in this House, Sinn Féin will remain true to its principles and word and vote against this irresponsible request.  We will push the issue to a vote and make others vote likewise.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">I accept that the Government in 2008 was probably bounced into the bank guarantee, given the manner in which it was established.  History will come down on the side of the view that the banks were pretty economical with the truth.  The notion that they had a liquidity crisis no longer stacks up.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Over the following three years, we have slowly learned more and more.  Things were far worse than they pretended.  The banks all over Europe had one great comfort of the time, namely, lenders of last resort.  Countries would back them to the hilt with unlimited support.  Things have changed and the banks are calling the shots and deciding what happens.  Sovereign countries are in difficulty and need help but do not seem to have a lender of last resort, unless the Germans decide to change their mind and allow the ECB to become such a lender.  All the talk suggests they will not but perhaps the future might dictate otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">September 2008 was a case of the tail wagging the dog and nothing seems to have changed.  We are at the mercy of banks and the current banking squeeze on the real economy, which is a result of the problems in the banks, is causing huge problems all over Europe.  The prospects of growth are constantly diminishing.  Everybody agrees that growth is essential if we are to make any inroads into the unemployment figures or progress in creating jobs.  Every government in Europe would like to see more jobs but as long as governments, which have been the lifesavers of the banks, cannot tell the banks what to do, it is hard to see them playing ball.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The notion that taxpayers are paying for the poor decisions of the banks and we now cannot access funds is difficult to take.  The chances of people, especially those running small and medium businesses, getting money today are very small.  Apart from financial issues, the financial markets are now interfering dramatically in the democratic process.  There are unelected leaders in Greece and Italy.  There has been a change of government in Spain and more people abstained or spoiled their votes than voted for the new Government.  A democratic deficit is developing on the back of the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The editorial in today's <i>Financial Times</i> states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_654">The mother crisis — bigger even than the banks' woes — is of course the run on sovereign debt.  Ireland found out the hard way that if a stressed sovereign tries to bear the excessive losses of banks, it breaks the back of sovereign and banking system alike.  There is no need for the eurozone as a whole to make the same mistake — provided it prioritises securing governments' liquidity over the bottomless taxpayer rescue of banks.  Central banks clearly meant to send the markets a message of global readiness to act, and to act together.  One hopes that eurozone leaders got the message too, and that they will heed the example at their summit next week.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_655">The fact that the Government is seeking to extend the disastrous decision to guarantee the banks in this country is proof positive that there is not a scintilla of difference between it and the last one.  It demonstrates most graphically that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, notwithstanding the Punch and Judy show that sometimes goes on in here, are exactly the same when it comes to the core issues.  It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledumber.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The bank guarantee was a disastrous decision.  This country led the way and was the poster boy for the deranged neoliberal economic dogma that has plunged the entire European and global economies into an unprecedented crisis.  It was also the people who led the way in the disastrous response to that by being the first to initiate a blanket guarantee of private profit crazed institutions whose reckless behaviour plunged this economy towards an abyss.  Now the rest of Europe seems to be copying us in moving down the same road.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The policy is to protect the banks at all costs, regardless of the consequences for society or the possibility of economic recovery.  The guarantee forced us into the clasp of the EU and IMF and the need to borrow money to pay off and recapitalise banks because of their reckless lending.  It allowed them to put us in a vice grip where they can ram brutal austerity down the throats of our citizens, crucifying them and ransoming our entire future against the interests of the bankers and bondholders.  This was not necessary and was done solely to protect the bondholders and corporate depositors.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">We had a guarantee for ordinary deposit holders.  What have we got for this?  For all the money we have put into the banks and back stop that our citizens have provided for them, we have received nothing.  They will not do anything for distressed mortgage holders and will not lend money into the economy.  No matter how much we bow down in front of the bondholders, they will still not lend us money at reasonable rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The important point for people to grasp is at the beginning of 2009 the ECB demanded, in the guidelines it issued, that we had to rescue the banks but not divert them from their central goal of profit maximisation.  The ECB was explicit in its instructions that the funding should not be diverted towards social or other macro-economic goals and that the overriding priority must be profit maximisation.  That is the problem.  Balance sheets and bondholders come first for the banks and they will not lend money into the economy or invest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We should repudiate this guarantee, tell the bondholders to take a hike and guarantee the moneys of ordinary deposit holders.  We must then set up a State bank which would not have all these liabilities to bondholders and others and which the State would instruct to give relief to ordinary mortgage holders and to invest in our economy so that we can put our people back to work.  If the Government is worried about money flowing out of the country, we should do as the Icelandic people did and impose capital controls to prevent that.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am sick of Labour Party Members claiming theirs is the only party opposed to the bank guarantee.  If that is so, why are they supporting its extension?  Are they saying that it is now necessary to do so in order to prevent deposit flight and a run on the banks?  Those are the arguments used by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party for the introduction of the guarantee.  Is the change in the Labour Party's position simply a consequence of its now being in government?  Its undertakings on this issue, on the renegotiation of the IMF-EU bailout, on third level fees and its absolute pledge to protect child benefit from any further reductions are as worthless as shares in Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The reality is that our financial institutions are still effectively zombie banks, mere conduits for the ECB funding which is used as blackmail to ensure continued payments to bondholders in order to shore up the EU banking system at the expense of our economy, welfare payments and social services.  In October 2011 lending to households fell by €614 million, while lending to business was down by €500 million.  International deposits are still being withdrawn, amounting to €4 billion in October, which was a small increase on August and September.  Since September last year banks have lost one third of their deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The policy of propping up zombie banks is a disaster which has cost €70 billion thus far.  The only solution is a publicly owned, democratically controlled banking system.  I refer the Minister to a recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development — not exactly a socialist think tank — which argued strongly for publicly owned banks which would provide greater stability and would not engage in speculation.  I ask the Fianna Fáil Members who support this proposal to reflect on the statement by the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, that the guarantee would turn out to be the cheapest bailout in history.  It has already cost Irish citizens €70 billion, which is half a year's GDP.  It is shameful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_664">Like my colleagues, I am very reluctant to support this measure.  If we go back to September 2008 we see that the initial decision — we still do not know exactly what happened behind closed doors — was dictated by a small group of bankers, probably four, who terrified the people inside the fortress of the Department of Finance on Merrion Street into giving way on this blanket guarantee.  The Minister's statement today would suggest that little has changed since then.  The views he sought in coming to a decision on an extension were from the Central Bank, the NTMA, the Department and so on.  In other words, all the usual suspects are being reeled out in support of a decision to extend the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The guarantee was apparently introduced in order to protect depositors.  Now we are told that this extension is also necessary to protect depositors.  However, the Minister indicated that last year, when the guarantee was already in place, there was a massive outflow of corporate deposits because the holders of those deposits had no confidence in depositing money in our banks, guarantee or no guarantee.  That is because the credit rating of the sovereign, that is, the State, has tanked in recent years.  We must ask whether there is any value to depositors in this, whether the State's guarantee is worth anything and why deposits were flowing out of the country despite the existence of the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">That guarantee was an opportunity for the last Government and this Government to take the banks by the scruff of the neck, control them and reform them.  The last Administration did not do so and nor is its successor doing so.  If the Government is serious about being in control, why is it not insisting that finance be made available to small business?  If the banks, with the exception of Bank of Ireland, are now State-controlled bodies, why is that lending not taking place?  The Credit Review Office is nothing but a puppet organisation of the banks.  Anybody who examines its composition, operations and findings will agree with that.  It is operating as a type of subsidiary of the banks and making recommendations on a very small scale without assisting people in any way.  It is a cover for the banks' failure to provide money to small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The second opportunity, of which neither Government took advantage, was to control the boards of the banks.  That failure is clearly evident in the case of the two so-called pillar banks.  Two weeks ago the chiefs of the two pillar bank boards, and a couple of others, had a meeting with members of the Government, including the Minister.  Despite the fact that the State is supposedly in control of at least one of these institutions, they eyeballed the Government and would not agree to its request in regard to variable interest rates.  This guarantee has given the banks everything.  They have taken advantage of it and have spat in the eye of the Government.  Why should we tolerate that type of behaviour from institutions which still consider themselves independent republics?  They seem to be able to defy those who either have a majority shareholding or membership of the boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">In that regard, one wonders what has happened to the public interest directors.  Have they all gone native?  They are certainly not acting in the interests of the public in conceding on issues like charges and remuneration.  On every issue, they are conceding to what the banks dictate.  In certain cases they have even given way to the desires of the boards of the banks against the wishes of the Government, particularly in regard to certain appointments.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_669">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Unfortunately, however, there was little reference to the statutory instrument itself.  Instead there were strong attempts by certain Members to visit the past and rewrite history.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for supporting this initiative, recognising the factual situation and dealing with the issue in a straightforward manner rather than seeking to gild the lily in any way.  Deputy Pearse Doherty's piece of casuistry reminded me of Bart Simpson's defence, "We didn't do it, nobody told us, we weren't there, it was the other people".  The record of the House shows that on the night Fianna Fáil proposed the guarantee it was supported by the Green Party, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, while the Labour Party voted against it.  Those are the facts.  Deputy Doherty can make his case in prose or in poetry but, either way, he is trying to rewrite history—</p>

In my view, the Deputy is correct on the facts, because the House was misled on the night.  When we asked whether it was a liquidity crisis or an insolvency crisis we were solemnly assured by the Minister that it was only a liquidity crisis and that the banks were quite solvent.  We voted on that basis and it looked like the right thing to do on the night.  Therefore, I do not blame the Deputy but he should admit what his party did and he should not be pretending that they did something different—</p>

          <p eId="para_701">I will not refer to Deputy Kelleher because we know Deputy Kelleher's speeches and they are all very entertaining.  I thank Deputy Mick Wallace for a very reflective contribution.  There is much in what he says and I always listen to him.  As for Deputy Boyd Barrett, I cannot pass the same compliment to him.  He dances around the edge of the great European crisis like a kid at a bonfire, cheering for more flames and looking for more burning but he does not really contribute to any solutions in the debate.  Deputy Ross is always very direct in what he says but he is economical with the truth on occasions because when he deplores that cabal who were in the Department of Finance on the infamous night, I ask who was there such as Seán FitzPatrick or Michael Fingleton?  I recall reading Deputy Ross's piece back in 2004 when he presented the Anglo Irish Bank business model as the prototype model that should be followed by all banks in Ireland and when he deplored the ineptitude of the Bank of Ireland when it did not follow the model of Seán FitzPatrick and really get profits for its shareholders.  Has he forgotten all this?  As we rewrite history, let us refer to all the facts and to all the things in the past and then move forward.  We voted for the guarantee on the night.  We thought it was the right thing to do because we were given assurances by the Minister.</p>

I do not think the Minister had the full facts on the night but that is the way the Parliament made its decision.  We are in a situation now where, effectively, the banking policy of the previous Government has proved to be disastrous.  They left Government without reconstructing and recapitalising the banks, again, probably because the Minister for Finance could not get the support of the Government at the end to take action.  It was left to us to do it and we have done it.  We now have two pillar banks which are working properly and they are lending to small business again—</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_846">While Fianna Fáil will not oppose this legislation, it provides us with an opportunity to debate broader issues such as health funding and how to provide an equitable and best possible health service.  It is an accepted fact that Ireland has a two-tier health system.  Those with private health insurance can access health care and treatments quicker, along with getting better hospital accommodation.  One could argue this in itself is unjust, inequitable and militates against those who cannot afford private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">This inequitable system is due not to private health insurance, however, but to the failure to provide a proper public health system in the first place.  It is fine if people want to continue taking out private health insurance.  The State, however, should be providing proper health facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">A cross-subsidisation process occurs in the health system between private health insurance and the State.  For example, if a person with VHI cover takes up a public health bed, the VHI is not charged for it.  In turn, this forces someone without private health insurance out of the system or delays their hospital appointments or procedures.  This is a key issue to be addressed in any debate on universal health insurance funded through the Central Fund and State subventions into the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">With no disrespect to the Minister of State present, Deputy Shortall, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, should be present in the Chamber for this debate.  Funding the health services in the years ahead is a fundamental issue.  Today's front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried an article highlighting the likelihood of extraordinary increases in VHI premia again next year.  While the headline figure of the drop in private health insurance from 52% to 48% is not alarming, the 48% who remain in private health insurance are downgrading their cover.  There is already financial pressure on those taking out private health insurance.  Any further increases in the premia will a have huge impact on them being able to continue with their cover.  Meanwhile, more people will be forced to fall back on an already pressured and overcrowded public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">We cannot wait for the Minister for Health's grand design for universal health insurance.  Along with waiting for the establishment of an implementation group, waiting for its report and then acting upon it, it will be some ten years before some form of universal health insurance is in place.  In the meantime, private health insurers consistently cherry-pick younger and lower risk customers, regardless of all the talk about community rating, intergenerational solidarity and cross-subsidisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Any analysis of the age profile and demographics of private health insurance customers shows the companies are pitching their products to younger people.  Now, the VHI is unable to cross-subsidise because it cannot compete with other private health insurers such as Quinn and Aviva which target younger customers.  Years from now when the age profile of Quinn and Aviva is older, some other private insurance health company will come in behind them while we wait for the Minister's grand plan for universal health insurance.  Meanwhile, the VHI is haemorrhaging funds and needs to constantly raise its premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Last year, for the first time, the VHI made a conscious decision to raise the premiums of certain policies targeted at a specific age profile.  That is against the ethos of the organisation but it was forced to make the decision because of the difficulties it has competing with other health insurers that do not incur the same costs.  I am not a champion of the VHI but it was the only health insurer in the market for years.  Young people joined, paid a premium and they subsidised older people who incurred most cost for the organisations.  This worked reasonably well.  There were inefficiencies in the processing and payment of claims and ensuring value for money on deals for its clients but there has been a marked improvement in this regard.  The difficulty is if the Minister continues to allow the stripping away of its base of younger customers, we will have a major problem in a few years.  Quinn Insurance is under huge pressure because it does not have the cash reserves it should while, following the European ruling, the VHI will be not exempt from financial regulation.  The State will quickly face a huge liability and the Government seems to be doing nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">With regard to community rating, a sum of €205 on each policy is transferred under the principle of intergenerational solidarity.  Everybody knows that is not enough but nobody is willing to talk about it.  All we are doing is putting our heads collectively in the sand in the vain hope a miracle will happen down the road.  The VHI cash reserves have been exhausted, it is no longer exempt from financial regulation and it will end up having to hike its premiums significantly in the months and years ahead, which will have further implications and repercussions for everybody in the public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">We have to be honest in how we deal with that.  The Minister needs to outline immediately what the implementation group will do, the criteria and guidelines that will be laid down, what it will have to analyse and assess and whether it will report back in a short timeframe.  As a Parliament, we cannot sit around and wait to discuss the group's final report.  It should report on a quarterly basis on this fundamental issue of how we develop, support and fund our health services.  This is important for all the reasons I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">On the broader issue of the health services, we should move beyond the election campaign at this stage because that was a different time.  Deputies who were not Ministers then promised, for example, to abolish prescription charges, to keep Roscommon hospital open, to keep St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital in Cork open and to retain services in it and to build a new hospital in the north east.  In February, the Minister promised a new hospital and that lacked credibility.  He walked into the Department knowing full well major financial challenges facing the country and his Department and promised to get rid of prescription charges, about which he spoke passionately in the House on numerous occasions because he believed the 50 cent charge would discourage people from going to the doctor and accessing medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">We then found out recently that he attended Fine Gael and Labour Party parliamentary party meetings ahead of the budget for a briefing he hoped would make it into the public domain with backbenchers applying pressure in order that he could get his way to achieve a larger slice of the budget.  That was his strategy but now we have been told he may propose a €2 prescription charge.  We witnessed a <i>volte-face</i> in the House minutes ago when Labour Party Deputies one after another traipsed up the steps and turned left through the lobbies to vote in favour of the extension of a bank guarantee that they have campaigned excitedly against all over the country over the past number of years.  They supported it today.  The kernel of the issue is it is difficult to take seriously a proposal from the Minister on any health issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The programme for Government sets out clearly that year on year increased funding would be provided for community, long-term and residential care for elderly people.  The Minister is in office ten months and he is running around the country closing these facilities.  He is shepherding people towards private health care.  He is using the HIQA, on the one hand, as cover to close nursing homes and, on the other, he is using budgetary constraints.  Either way, it is a complete breach of the commitment in the programme for Government signed by both parties only ten months ago to provide increased funding year on year.  This goes to the kernel of the matter of how we can believe in and trust the Government on the implementation of universal health insurance and other schemes that have been announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The Minister of State made a commitment a few weeks ago but I do not know whether it will happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_860">A few days later, there were leaks from the same sources saying free GP care would not be available to all those on long-term illness benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">We are still unsure as to who is running the system.  The Minister castigated the HSE on "Prime Time" recently because its financial controller said it would delay payment of expenses to staff.  He rubbished the executive but, only a few months ago, he stood up with pride to say he had seized control of the HSE and sacked the board.  The cameras were organised and he was outside the HSE's headquarters dragging staff out by the scruff of their neck.  Now he is saying this terrible organisation made this decision.  He is either in charge or he is not.  If he is, it is time he stood up and acted like it.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">My difficulty is every day confidence in his comments saps away.  Most Members are fair, reasonable and rational but what was said prior to the election and what has been said since is at variance.  However, every day since the formation of the Government confidence in what the Minister said has ebbed away and it has been undermined by his actions, deeds and words.  Most of the red line issues of huge importance to him are ebbing away on a daily basis.  We await universal health insurance, free GP care for everybody, investment in primary care units and community and long-term residential care.  The Minister seems to be moving further away from providing those services.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Fianna Fáil will support the Bill.  The principle of intergenerational solidarity and community rating is noble and should be supported but we must go further and realise that if we retain the current system, the private health insurance system will not be sustainable.  It will collapse around us and the public health system will be snowed under.  The State will not have the capacity to fund or support it.  We cannot wait years.  The Minister must act quickly and decisively to ensure sustainability in the private health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The issue of preventive medicine has also not been tackled.  The HSE has health promotion units and the Department of Health promotes campaigns sometimes to quit smoking, reduce alcohol intake and take up fitness regimes but they are piecemeal.  It is my opinion that whatever steps we take in respect of this matter would not cost a great deal to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Everyone knows that we are going to be obliged to take a very strong stance on this issue.  We are sitting on a generational time bomb in the context of obesity in children.  I am aware of the Minister of State's commitment to reducing the level of alcohol consumption.  We owe it to younger people to address the issue of obesity.  We must educate ourselves and our children on the need to be active, to be fit and to eat in a healthy manner.  The statistics relating to what is happening to the younger generation are alarming.  Obesity is becoming a huge issue and, if we do not act now, it will become a major killer in the years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">There is a need for a wholehearted and concerted effort on the part of a number of Departments and agencies on this matter.  Responsibility in this area always seems to fall between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Transport, Tourism and Sport, etc., and the HSE and other agencies.  What is required is a collective, singular focus on how we promote healthy living.  Let us consider the position which obtains in other countries.  In Australia, for example, there is a sense that the entire society has bought into the idea of a healthy lifestyle and there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of people there who smoke.  It is surprising, particularly in light of all the information available, that 28% of the population here continues to smoke.  I continue to struggle with the addiction of smoking and I find it incredible that so many younger people are taking up the habit.  It is also incredible that these individuals engage in binge drinking on a regular basis.  Coupled to this is the fact that so many young people have sedentary lifestyles, do not take exercise and eat the wrong foods.  This is a matter we must act on.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I introduced a Private Members' Bill last week which proposes that products sold in fast food outlets should be labelled to indicate the number of calories they contain.  I am of the view that it would be worthwhile to discuss the possibility of introducing sugar and fat taxes.  Taxation is sometimes seen as merely being a mechanism to raise revenue.  However, it can also send out a signal on behalf of society, the Government or the Parliament.  For example, the price of cigarettes has been increased on a continual basis.  This is obviously a revenue-generating measure but, equally, it also sends out a strong signal on the part of Government and society to the effect that cigarettes are not good for people.  We raise the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products in order to make them more expensive and less attractive and thereby discourage people from smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I am not a killjoy but I am of the view that we have been slow to tackle the extremely important issue of childhood obesity.  The latter can give rise to diabetes and to people losing their sight or being obliged to have limbs amputated.  As Members are aware, there are many more things which could happen if we fail to address this issue.  Obesity was a matter of concern in America in the 1960s but it is now an epidemic there.  The patterns which occurred in the US at that time are now being repeated in Britain and Ireland.  We know what will be the outcome of this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">In the broader context of discussing health insurance, one of the ways in which we can promote health and secure funding is to focus on prevention.  The latter is the cheapest way to ensure that the health service delivers on the commitment to ensure that people remain healthy and stay alive for as long as possible.  That is a key issue.  I propose that the Departments of Education and Skills, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Health, etc., should jointly establish a health promotion unit that would have the requisite powers and resources at its disposal to allow it to target the key issues with which we must deal, namely, smoking, alcohol abuse and childhood obesity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_870">This Bill is necessary to provide, as the explanatory memorandum states, "a mechanism to support intergenerational solidarity" in the health insurance market.  The memorandum also states that such solidarity is required because "there are incentives for insurers to design products that are attractive only to healthier lives, undermining intergenerational solidarity and the common good protections".  Once again, the Oireachtas is being obliged to enact legislation in order to try to regulate the distortions and inequities brought about by the private health insurance market.  Primarily, the latter is a market rather than a means of funding health care.  In order to maximise profits, the private health insurance market often discriminates in favour of the healthy and against the aged and the ill.  The State is then obliged to intervene — it has done so repeatedly — in order to try to redress the imbalance.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">A question arises with regard to why the Government insists that the way forward for health reform in this State is by means of an insurance-based system.  We are all of one mind with regard to the need for reform.  It is the proposition of an insurance-based system to which the Fine Gael appears to be absolutely wed which gives rise to real concerns on my part.  My remarks in this regard provide only a small insight of the range of concerns I harbour about the model that has been proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It is interesting to revisit the programme for Government and the commitments it contains in respect of health reform based on insurance.  The programme states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_873">A system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI) will be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system complete [that is, finished] within this Government's term of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">That is a major commitment by any standard.  The first step in implementing it is supposed to be a White Paper on financing universal health insurance.  The programme for Government indicates that this White Paper will be published early in the Government's first term.  Some time ago, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, explained to me what constitutes such a term.  When referring to two terms, he stated that the period involved was ten years.  Therefore, the extent of one term of office is five years.  So the White Paper is to be published early in this Administration's first term in office and, as the programme for Government states, it will "review cost-effective pricing and funding mechanisms for care and care to be covered under UHI".</p>
          <p eId="para_875">On 14 September last, I tabled a parliamentary question in which I asked the Minister to indicate the timeframe for the publication of the White Paper.  In reply, he made what I believe to be a considerable departure from the commitment provided in the programme for Government.  The Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_876">The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system ... While universal health insurance is the ultimate destination of this Government's reform programme, there are a number of important stepping stones along the way and each of these will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">In the reply, the Minister also mentioned the special delivery unit, strengthening primary care and repeated that oft trundled-out phrase to the effect that "money follows the patient".  Furthermore, he indicated that the Government had given approval for the establishment of an implementation group on universal health insurance and stated that this will have responsibility for assisting the Department in preparing the White Paper.  The Minister made a further significant observation when he said that the White Paper will be published within the Government's current term in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Given that I look at the responses I receive and I listen to what the Ministers state in reply to me here as a spokesperson on both health and children, I believe there is a big difference between that statement "within the Government's current term in office", within a five-year period, and the programme for Government commitment to publish "early in the Government's first term".  Early, in my view, would be in the first couple of years.  Now it seems, at least to me, that the timeframe is being extended all the time.  We are always tempted to use the oft-used analogy of kicking the can down the road and I am tempted to apply it once again in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">That aside, and explaining my concerns, the Minister went further in that response and added an "However", stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_880">[T]he precise cost of universal health insurance will significantly depend on the success of various reform measures ... over the next 3-4 years.  This will influence the development of the White Paper and, as such, it is not possible to be more specific regarding its publication at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Something that is to expose itself in the next three to four years will influence the preparation and presentation subsequently of the White Paper that was definitely promised in the early stages.  Whether it even presents within the so-called "five-year term" of the 31st Dáil is now a moot question.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Here we see a fundamental element, which is exactly as it must be seen, of the Fine Gael and Labour Government's health reform agenda being kicked years down the road.  The White Paper would appear to be turning into a white elephant.  The Minister, in his response, stated that he saw the delivery of all of this within a ten-year period but there is no guarantee that the Government will be back after this Dáil, whatever its duration.  Every day we are here it becomes more interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">In the meantime, we have the continuation of the inequitable and inefficient two-tier health care system which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Shortall, and all of their colleagues so strongly and correctly criticised when in opposition.  I hope they have not changed their minds on that because the current system is abhorrent.  It ill-serves us as a people and I do not believe that anyone could describe it in any international forum in a short couple of sentences.  The type of system we have in this State would take some explaining in any language.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Worse is the continuing imposition of the health cuts imposed by the former Government partners, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  In my home county of Monaghan, I campaigned vehemently with colleagues across the political spectrum in this House in opposition to the removal of key services from our local hospital, Monaghan General Hospital.  Never could I have envisaged the further loss of services from that hospital site following on the general election in February last.  All of the acute services had been removed and none of us, including former Deputies of the main party in government with whom I developed a close and respectful working relationship that continues to this day, could ever have imagined that this new Government of Fine Gael and Labour would impose further cuts after all that happened over the preceding years to which those parties were witness and to which they were such strong voices in opposition, and yet that is what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Our minor injuries unit has been reduced from a seven-day to a five-day, Monday to Friday service, and from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., as it was, to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  It is a major loss of critical access for those in my home county and the Minister's response to me time and again is that they can now go to North East Doctor on Call at Castleblaney or to the emergency department at Cavan General Hospital, both of which are at their wits' end in trying to cope with the current footfall and throughput.  It is making situations even worse.  All of this is excused on the basis of savings.  The previous Government at least tried to paper it over with the argument of patient safety, but this is nakedly about money.  It is not about patient service in any shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Bill has been introduced in that context and in the context of a declining health insurance market.  VHI has stated that it expects up to 200,000 people to give up private health insurance by the end of 2012 as a result of rising unemployment.  The proportion of the population with health insurance declined from 49% in 2007 to 47% in 2010, and the numbers qualifying and receiving medical cards have increased.  Some 30% of the population have a medical card, while 23% have neither medical card nor health insurance, including myself, on principle, and must pay as they go through every stage of the health care system.  Thus, 53% of the population depend entirely on the public health system, from which the other 47% also benefit significantly, for example, from the use of private beds in public hospitals, but data from the OECD show that the largest proportion of funding for health care in the State comes from the public finances, at 80.7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">When we debated the predecessor to this Bill, the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, I stated that we were seeing a turning of the tide.  I stated that the astronomical rise in unemployment was resulting in more people applying for medical cards, the cancellation of private health insurance and ever greater demands on the public health services.  These services, because of the fundamentally flawed policies and the disastrous mismanagement of the health services by previous Governments all of which were led by Fianna Fáil, were almost at breaking point.  I stated that the cuts imposed since autumn 2007 and greatly increased cuts in 2008 were creating a crisis situation, and that is what we have lived with since.  Regrettably, my words have proven correct.  Two years on, we see the ramshackle structure of the health services under even greater pressure than at any time previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">This Bill simply addresses one aspect of that structure, the need for what is called societal and intergenerational solidarity in the health insurance sector.  It does this by continuing up to the end of 2012 the arrangement whereby the burden of the costs of health services is shared by insured persons through a cost subsidy, an age-related tax credit funded by the collection of a levy on all insured lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There is a need to protect the health system from a predatory approach by health insurers which would see older persons and persons with illnesses being forced to pay higher health insurance premiums, and this Bill seeks to achieve that for another year.  How long will we have to depend on such stop-gap measures?</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The Minister's back-tracking on the programme for Government commitments on universal health insurance does not augur well.  I will argue for a very different approach, namely, universal health care delivery, delivered to all on the basis of need, and need alone, and paid for through direct and progressive taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">If the Minister's promise is fulfilled within the term of the Government, then clearly the whole legislative and funding framework around health insurance will have to be changed.  As I pointed out earlier, the can is being kicked a long way down the road — conveniently, I add.  All of this points to the need for a new direction, and the direction that I believe is best suited to our needs is the one I and my colleagues in Sinn Féin, and other voices, have long advocated.  Real inter-generational solidarity and social solidarity are needed across our health care system, not just within a private health insurance market.  For this, we require a single-tier public health care system, funded by fair and progressive taxation, with access to every citizen based on need, and need alone, and without any relation to the balance in one's bank account, the money in one's pocket or one's geographical location.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Why complicate matters by creating a separate health insurance system that requires a huge battery of legislative and regulatory checks to make it work?  The only logic for the course being proposed by this Government, represented and spoken for by the Fine Gael Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is to benefit the private health insurance industry — I say this to the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, as a well respected Labour Party representative of long standing.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Here we are, on the cusp of yet another budget, budget 2012, which will be announced next week.  As we face into this new budget and all that will entail, there is no sign of any kind of fundamental change in the thinking of the Government or that any new direction will be presented for our health system by the Government for the future.  Fine Gael and Labour, which made so much of the health care system in the lead-up to general elections over recent years, very particularly under Deputy James Reilly in his Opposition position, facing off with the former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, have given rise to a sense of expectation among the wider electorate.  None of it even presents on the horizon at this point in time.  We are faced with the continuation of the dreadful system we have but with no prospect of real address, let alone reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">My appeal, as it is on so many issues in regard to the Government, and to those in the Labour Party in the first instance, with whom, on the basis of their proclaimed position on many issues, I would find comfort and common appreciation, is to use their very important and valuable access to the decision making process in the Government and in the Cabinet to ensure that new directions are found, that new models are mooted and that we have the implementation of a system of which we can all be proud.  That is within their gift.  It is within the timeframe of a five-year cycle — a term of Government.  In looking back, would that not be a proud legacy for their involvement in this 31st Dáil?</p>

          <p eId="para_897">We have a two-tier system.  It is an obscenity that access to decent health care is dependent on how much money a person has.  We are in a situation where, as a result of the EU-IMF arrangement, albeit under the cover of health and safety considerations, health services are being slashed across the country.  Local hospitals and accident and emergency units are being downgraded and there is a trolley catastrophe daily in many of our hospitals.  Those are the problems we have to resolve if we are to have a health system of which we will be proud, which is fair and where there is equal opportunity for access to decent health care, which is one of the most important priorities for anybody and for any decent society.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">This legislation proposes to extend the risk equalisation scheme.  We have a two-tier, privatised health system that many people, because of the chronic underfunding and the crisis that exists in our public system, are forced, because they do not have a choice, into taking out private health insurance.  Given this and in so far as this is a measure to try, at some level, to regulate the private health insurance system and create some sort of level playing field, we have no choice but to go along with it.  However, the problem is that it still follows the failed strategy of having competing private health insurers as the way in which to deliver health services.  In other words, it accepts and is underpinned by the notion of a two-tier system where affordability will dictate the quality of a person's health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Those who advocate this kind of approach to delivering health care would say that its principle objective is to improve access to health services.  In that regard, it is failing completely.  Competition has not led to lower premiums and Irish health insurance companies are raising their premiums, most recently with Quinn Insurance hiking up its premiums by 12%.  Health policy expert Professor Charles Normand of Trinity College Dublin warned in the aftermath of this hike that those plans that have competing private insurers may not be a very good mechanism for keeping prices down.  If we look at the case of the United States, we find dramatic evidence of how correct that is.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The health system in the United States is based on competing private insurers, and it is the most bureaucratic and the most expensive health system in the world, with US costs twice those of comparable countries.  Some 31% of health spending goes on bureaucracy, executive salaries and massive profits.  Over $600 million of the $2 trillion spent on health in the United States, which is 15% of GDP, goes on these salaries, bureaucracy and profits.  In the Irish case, the Government is proposing to continue down this road of competing private health insurers, although it is costly and does not deliver access to the health service.  The Government must abandon the universal health insurance model, which is only about profit in private health insurance companies, and instead provide a national health service that is accessible to all and is based on progressive taxation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_901">It is rather strange to discuss private health insurance.  Whether the legislation is necessary is one thing but a great deal more is needed in our health service.  Many people have believed in and purchased private health insurance.  I did too, many years ago.  One sometimes asks oneself why one did so.  It has nothing to do with our health system or the quality of our health service but with accessing that system and having faith in being able to access it.  That is the reason so many people have opted for private insurance.  The aim is to access treatment speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">According to the Minister's speech last night, almost half the population, 47.5%, have private health insurance in one form or another through inpatient plans.  Of course, the VHI has the bulk of this business.  The numbers are decreasing but it is still a significant amount.  In 2010, €1.9 billion was spent on premia, a 19% increase on the 2008 figure.  There is still plenty of money about.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">On the one hand, private health insurance takes pressure off the public system, but it is based on unfairness and the fact that payment will secure quicker access.  Payment will get the scan and quicker access to the consultant and secure the private or semi-private room.  I cannot but be aware of the system in the private hospitals.  When one gets a time for an appointment, it takes place at that time and when one gets a date for a procedure, nine out of ten times it will happen on that date.  Patients generally do not have to go through our chaotic accident and emergency system unless there is an emergency.  Now, money can pay for the various clinics catering for minor ailments, broken limbs and so forth, and the waiting time is minimal.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I do not understand why our public system cannot provide the same efficient service.  We have excellent doctors, nurses and other personnel.  There have been some very good developments with the breast screening and cancer services, but there are major problems.  In 2004 the then Minister for Health and Children stated, "The one thing I want for the country I love is to have a health service that is accessible to every citizen, regardless of his or her wealth".  That Government had seven further years in office and I do not believe progress was made in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">We have a two tier health service, with access based on ability to pay rather than need.  We need a fair and equitable health system.  The programme for Government states that this Government is the first in the history of the State that is committed to developing a universal single tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  Within the programme there are ambitious plans to radically change the Irish health system and to provide for equal access, universal health insurance, which will be compulsory whether it is with private or public insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">That is the plan but in the meantime the reality is very different.  There is immense pressure on the public health system.  We are aware of the waiting lists and yesterday the Minister of State and I attended the briefing on the mental health service, so we know what is happening in that area.  People are dying unnecessarily.  I pay my private health insurance and because I am healthy, thankfully, and have not needed to use it more than once or twice, my good health is benefitting those in the private system.  However, it is not benefitting people generally.  The system must be more equitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The Bill seeks to regulate the health insurance market and the area of risk equalisation.  The Supreme Court judgment found that risk equalisation was not maintaining what was termed "the common good".  I believe the common good, in broad terms, means having a health system whose core principle is the common good of all, not just the good of those who have the ability to pay for it.  We need a fair and equitable health system, with equal access available to everybody and not based on ability to pay.  The Bill refers to all consumers, without differentiation being made in respect of age and health status.  There should be no differentiation within the health system.  We must look to the common good for all of our society.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_908">This debate is about private insurance and competition within that market.  Competition is really about maximising profits, which is what is happening.  In the past few days huge increases have been proposed in the cost of health insurance.  Quinn Healthcare has proposed an increase of 12% and one can take it that the other companies will shortly follow suit.  If the Government raises the charges for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals in the budget, that will further increase the cost of health insurance.  There will be a number of significant increases, as there have been in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">This insurance favours young and healthy people rather than elderly and ill people.  It all relates back to the type of health system in this country, which is a two tier system that favours very wealthy people in society who can buy health insurance and get preferential access to health services.  What we need is a public health system, paid for through progressive taxation, that is free at the point of use, with access based on medical need.  That should be the priority of this Government and Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">That priority has been put at risk by the policies of previous Governments and the current Government.  One example is the huge reductions in budgets for the general hospital service and for acute hospitals.  In south Tipperary there was a €13 million reduction in the budget in the past three years; in Blanchardstown the reduction was approximately €20 million in the past two years.  Most hospitals in the country are in a similar position.  That means beds are closed, beds are put in corridors, there are trolleys in accident and emergency departments, access to services is hugely reduced and there is huge pressure on staff.  Unless these budget reductions and the moratorium on recruitment of replacement staff are reversed, the current crisis in health services will intensify and ordinary people will find it almost impossible to get services.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I believe the services should be locally based and accessible.  Independent international professional research shows that locally based services in smaller units give better quality care, better value for money and better access to services.  Unfortunately, that is not happening with the Minister's reform programme, which is transferring services to larger hospitals, as if big is best.  However, big is not best for quality, value for money or access.  We should focus on providing public health services paid for by progressive taxation, with access based on medical need.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">If one is looking to pick holes in this Bill, one might ask whether there should be inter-generational solidarity.  Of course there should.  However, that is if one accepts that private health insurance is an appropriate way to fund the health care system and that people can buy their way into our hospitals, or at least skip other people who might well be more ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Labour Party campaigned — it is in the programme for Government — for a universal health insurance levy but it is not clear what role health insurance will play when that levy is introduced.  That must be articulated.  For example, it is not clear to me what the relationship will be to pay-related social insurance, which had a health component to it but which was amalgamated in recent years.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">People are choosing to have health insurance, where it eats heavily into the budgets of many households that can just about manage to pay it, because they are terrified that if they get sick they will not have the ability to get into hospital for the appropriate care.  As has been said previously, when people get into hospital the level of care is good but the problem is accessing those services.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The difficulty in recent years, and certainly in the past 12 months and since this Government has taken office, is that there has been a plethora of closures, including ward closures with a consequent knock-on effect.  It is the same position with the publicly funded nursing homes.  There is a consequence to taking this approach.  Just as our health service developed in a fragmented manner it is being reformed in a fragmented way.  It is not at all coherent to the citizens of this country and it is scaring people into taking up private health insurance because they are frightened about what happened to somebody like the late Susie Long, who delayed getting a colonoscopy long enough to end up with a form of cancer that was not treatable.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">We have not had a national health strategy in this country and this Government has not articulated one.  I stated on several occasions that we must have it mapped out to us what is intended.  If we are entering the second Republic that is being talked about we should look to the future in terms of our expectations of the services that are to be provided.  There is a responsibility on this Government to do that in a coherent way for people.  That would help people in making a decision on whether they need health insurance.  They are being frightened into believing they need it.  They are afraid that if they or a family member becomes ill, the ability to get into a hospital and be treated is very much reduced without it.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">This Bill serves to highlight the inequity in our health system in that we must bring in legislation to provide for increases in tax credits to facilitate private companies in making profits on people's fear that they will not get access to the health services they need.  That whole market has been driven by fear in that if people want to be sure they can leap-frog the queues when they need to enter our hospital system they can get the access they are often denied under the existing health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">This morning I was contacted by a constituent who has a 95% blockage in his carotid artery and is in imminent risk of a massive stroke.  He does not have health insurance.  He has been told there is a two year waiting list for his operation.  Even with the recognition that his case is an emergency he has been put on a list for admission to Galway University Hospital.  He has been waiting two weeks to get a bed in that hospital.  The accident and emergency department is overrun with trolleys and it cannot accept any patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">If that man had private health insurance he would have been admitted last week, had his operation, would be recovering now and waiting to go home to rejoin his family.  Instead, he is sitting at home paralysed with fear, wondering if he will have a stroke before he is called for admission to Galway University Hospital.  That is the health system we have created, and that is the system that has resulted in ordinary people who cannot afford private health insurance sitting in fear.  Other people are at the pin of their collar trying to ensure they have insurance so that in the event of such a situation arising for them or a member of their family they can get access to our health system.  That is a shame on us all, and it is a shame on any Government that perpetuates such a system.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">We heard from the Minister's contribution last night that €1.9 billion is being paid in health insurance premiums.  If that money was taken in direct taxation and put into our hospital system we would have no need for private health insurance.  We would not need the profiteers selling people plans and pumping money onto families, and families paying over €3,000 a year in health insurance premiums.  We could have a system that would guarantee access to all and ensure that people like my constituent would not be fearful that if something were to happen they would not get the health treatment, and the system, they need.  This Bill serves to highlight that inequity which, unfortunately, this Government wants to perpetuate and put on a statutory basis where everybody will be paying exorbitant amounts of money under so-called universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">We should use the €1.9 billion in premiums and the existing health budget to ensure we have a system that is free at point of access for everybody, guarantees universal cover for everybody and ensures that people do not have to live in fear.  It should ensure that if their health lets them down this State will care for them and not leave them languishing on waiting lists or trolleys in hospitals, reminding them that if only they could afford health insurance they could leap-frog the system and use the benefit money brings them to get treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_929">If there was no other option but to go down the route the Minister is taking, namely, the idea of inter-generational solidarity, it would be a good thing and one could not argue against that but the reality is that it is only solidarity among those who can afford this private health care.  I do not have any health care package, and obviously I do not have a medical card, and the reason for that is I do not believe I am better than anyone else.  I believe I am equal to everyone else in this country.  I have two young children whom I love more than any children in this country but at the same time I do not believe they are better than any other children in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Earlier this summer I had an experience of using a service where one could pay to skip the queue when I visited family and friends in London with my family and we went to LEGOLAND.  In LEGOLAND, which is not a life and death situation, there is a state of play where the rich children get to skip the queue ahead of the poor children.  I was in a lucky position where I could have paid for my children to skip the queue but I decided I would not because I did not believe it was fair.  For approximately £80 a day my children could have gone on all of the fairground rides before all of the other children.  I left that place very angry that people could be treated like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I am in the lucky position that neither of my children, touch wood, is sick and I hope they will not be too sick in the future.  We heard interesting figures from Deputy Ó Caoláin earlier that 80.7% of the health service is paid from the public purse yet 53% of the population are treated as second class citizens in that they will have other people jumping the queue ahead of them because apparently they are more important than other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">I always understood that the Labour Party was a socialist party and the idea of socialism was that everyone is treated equally.  It begs the question: what is equal about a situation where a poor child could potentially be left to die while a rich child gets to skip the queue?  I cannot see how any socialist could stick by this form of socialism.  It does not make sense, so I am left a little bit baffled on where socialism has gone, if it is about killing the poor and letting the rich live longer.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">I also used to be in the VHI, but a couple of years ago I decided that the system left a lot to be desired, so I opted out of it.  About two months ago I had to get an operation on my arm and I went to Beaumont Hospital under the public system.  The only problem was getting in there, but once I got in, the people were so nice.  The surgeon was wonderful and the nurses were fantastic.  It seems to be accepted that we have a fantastic system, if we could only get into it.  The notion that we can get better care under the private system than the public system needs to be questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Approximately 47% of the public pay for private health insurance at the moment, but the State is paying 90% of their care.  The main reason for people to opt for private health care is a fear that they will not get into the public system in time.  Private health insurance allows them to be bumped up the waiting list.  Most people who take out private health insurance are not looking for extra privileges, but they are afraid that they might have to wait too long, given the need for some serious medical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">I recently read a very good article by Fintan O'Toole, and I would like to finish by quoting some of it:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_940">There are, for example, four different categories of patients: medical card holders, who are entitled (in theory at least) to fully free services from GPs and in public hospitals; "dual cover" patients who have both a medical card and private health insurance; "non-covered" patients who have neither a medical card nor private health insurance; and patients with private health insurance only.  How could such a system not require a vast bureaucracy to run it and how could it not lead to inefficiencies?</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_941">As with so much else, however, this vicious and absurd system was tolerated so long as the middle classes could afford to manoeuvre their way around it.  But the illusion that middle class people could actually benefit from systematic inequality was just another Celtic Tiger con job.  What was actually happening was that middle class people were being conned into paying twice — through taxes and private insurance — for an inadequate, inefficient and unfair system.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_942">A system that depends on people paying again for services they have already paid for through taxation is inherently unsustainable.  It is now unravelling.  No amount of insurance can buy you out of an overcrowded A&amp;E.  And the cost of fattening up the VHI for privatisation is simply too high for most people to pay.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_943">The truth is coming home: the rotten injustice of our health system is bad even for those who thought they could avoid it.  A fair, one-tier system of social health insurance is not just less shameful and better for the poor.  It is also more rational, more efficient and better for everyone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_944">This Bill draws attention to the debacle that is the Irish health service and the role of private health insurance.  I find it absolutely shocking that 47% of the population have private health insurance.  That is a huge number of families who are already overburdened with other bills and who have to scrape together the means to come up with those funds.  It is interesting to note that this figure has declined.  Some 29,000 people no longer pay for private health insurance as a result of the recession, job losses and the increased premia that these companies are charging.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">We have to examine why these families are paying thousands of euro for private health insurance.  It is not unheard of for a family of four to pay about €5,000 for such insurance.  It is obviously not because they hate their neighbours and they feel ashamed to share a room with somebody if they end up in hospital.  The reason is that they do not have confidence they will get the treatment for themselves and their families out of the public health service.  This is particularly graphic in the case of cancer care.  Anybody who has been in the system knows that the centres of excellence and the public health system in dealing with cancer is better than anything that the private insurance companies could deliver, or at least equal to it.  Why would anybody pay thousands to go into the private system?  The only explanation is that they cannot get into the system.  That has to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Like Deputy Catherine Murphy, I would also like to mention my former colleague Susie Long, who died needlessly in 2007 because she had to wait eight months for a colonoscopy.  It was an absolutely tragic situation, and we were told it would never again happen and her memory would be marked in some way.  The promise at the time was there would be no distinction between public and private patients on waiting lists and people's bank balances would have nothing to do with who would be seen first.  That was a lie.  The number waiting for colonoscopies has increased.  It has doubled since 2010 to 2,400 people.  How many of those people will end up unnecessarily dead like Susie Long, because they did not have the money?  The Blackrock Clinic only this month revealed to <i>www.irishhealth.com</i> that it has no waiting list at all for colonoscopies.  People who are covered by private health insurance can get a colonoscopy at any time, but if they are not, they must come up with €1,000.  Who in this day and age has €1,000?  Very few people have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">It is patently obvious that people only choose private health care because they do not have confidence that they can rely on the public system.  This is madness.  The whole debate exposes the madness of having for profit companies involved in the whole system of health care.  We see it graphically in respect of nursing homes, where the Government is standing over the closure of public nursing homes, while at the same time driving people into private nursing home provision.  It is an absolutely ridiculous situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The irony is that the private health insurance companies — Aviva, VHI and Quinn — all massively hiked their premiums this year.  In fact, VHI did so twice.  These companies are highly profitable, largely due to the Irish market in the case of Aviva.  If people are willing to pay thousands of euro to these private companies for a minor advantage, then this demonstrates the point that they would be prepared to pay more in PRSI contributions if they had the confidence that they would get a decent public system.  Instead, as a result of Government policies, we have moneys diverted so that the public system is run down and the private sector is boosted.   That is disgraceful and is shameful of the Labour Party to participate in that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_949">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  The four principles of private health insurance in Ireland are community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit.  The Health Insurance Act 2009 introduced, on an interim basis, a system to deliver on the policy position supporting community rating, which is achieved by risk equalisation.  A more robust, transparent and effective scheme for risk equalisation to support the core policy of community rating is to be introduced from 2013.  Therefore, the current Bill will extend the interim scheme for a further year, while the details of the 2013 scheme are advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">At this juncture it is worth examining the idea of risk equalisation, as it is a term that is often bandied around, and in some cases by people who do not have a clear understanding of it.  Risk equalisation is a process that aims to neutralise, in an equitable manner, differences in insurers' costs that arise due to variations in the health status of their members.  Risk equalisation involves transfer payments between health insurers to spread some of the claims cost of high risk members among all the private health insurers in the market, in proportion to their market share.  Risk equalisation is a common mechanism in countries with community rated health insurance systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">It is worth examining the background to the current legislation.  The Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2009 provide the statutory basis for the regulation of the health insurance market in the interests of the common good.  At the centre of the common good is intergenerational solidarity between all insured persons and community rated health insurance.  Following the July 2008 Supreme Court judgment people continued to have access to community-rated health insurance plans and to benefit from other common good protections such as open enrolment and lifetime cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">However, the reality is that in the absence of a mechanism to support inter-generational solidarity there are incentives for insurers to design products that are attractive only to healthier lives, undermining inter-generational solidarity and the common good protections.  This would not be universally beneficial to all members of the State and certain sections of society could easily be discriminated against or simply left uninsured.  In these circumstances the market can be subject to fragmentation and inter-generational solidarity weakened.  In the absence of an appropriate response, it would be in the interests of all insurers to focus on products that would be particularly attractive to healthier lives and to minimise features in their products that would be attractive to older people and those who suffer ill-health.  This conflicts with the common good principles underlying regulation of the market and should not be acceptable to any understanding Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted for these reasons.  Its main objectives were to affirm that the purposes of the Health Insurance Acts were to ensure that access to health insurance cover is available to all consumers without differentiation in respect of age and health status, to strengthen the provisions to achieve this purpose, to enhance inter-generational solidarity and community-rated health insurance and to provide for the implementation of related measures to achieve these objects.  This has proved to be solid legislation with one noteworthy element.  The key measure was the introduction, in respect of persons aged 50 years and over and for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, of a new age-related tax credit in respect of payments due in that period of private health insurance premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">This measure was to be funded by the collection of an annual levy on health insurance companies based on the number of lives covered by policies underwritten by them.  These measures provide that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people and that older people receive tax credits equal to the amount of the additional premium such that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product.  In this way community rating is maintained while insurers receive higher premiums in respect of older people to compensate partly for the higher level of claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">This method of sharing costs is known as the interim scheme of age-related tax credits and community rating levy and is a scheme of considerable benefit.  The main object of this Bill is to continue to ensure that in the interests of inter-generational solidarity the burden of the costs of health services are shared by insured persons by providing that the cost subsidy between the young and the old, as provided for by the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, is continued for a further year.  There is considerable merit in this and I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">Deputy Murphy should cast her eye to the Gallery where there are young men and women from our schools who will make up the insurance market of the future and who will look to us and to the Government to bring about a reformed health service, including universal health coverage, which will be fair and equitable.  This is why the Bill is important.  It is important that the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, given primary care tasks, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, are supported in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I challenge those opposite to come over and engage meaningfully in the process rather than giving a constant barrage of negativity.  Last night, the Minister of State stated that the main object of the Bill is to ensure the burden of the costs of health services are shared by insured persons.  Maintaining our health service and delivering vital reform is difficult.  It is not easy but the process must be carried out.  We must ensure that we maintain a functioning health insurance market which delivers not only for the insurance companies — I do not support them — but for customers, the marketplace and patients.  As other speakers have stated, it should be based on the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  These are important elements of the reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The Bill provides safeguards and the fundamental principles necessary but we must engage actively with the insurers.  If one speaks to the insurers, one hears their speech and tone but we must engage with them to ensure the health providers, insurers and patients are at the forefront of everything we do.  More important, we must meet the needs of customers and patients and facilitate the delivery of a quality health service at competitive prices.  The continuing price increases we have seen from some insurance companies have forced people to consider their insurance needs, as Deputy Claire Daly suggested.  In some cases such people have opted out, in other cases they have changed plans and in other cases again people have stayed where they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I am a customer of the VHI and I am probably a patient at this stage as well.  We need a competitive marketplace.  If we do not have it, the current model will compound the difficulties with providing resources for the public health system.  At that stage those opposite would come here with a different tale of woe and give us a different story.  Let us have a real debate and reflect on the additional demand on our public hospitals if we did not have private health insurance.  The funding of beds in public hospitals plays an important role in the funding of our health system.  The Deputies opposite cannot have it both ways or any way they wish.  Let us have universal health care and a fair and equitable health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The country is similar to an oil tanker in the ocean: one cannot turn it with one tug of the wheel; it takes time.  Deputy Wallace is involved in business and he is well aware of the transformation and reform necessary in the country and he is aware that it cannot take place over night.  It will take time.  Let us have some realisation of the situation from those on the opposite side regarding the issues of the health system.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State in the House are at the forefront of brining about reform.  Let us make this happen.  I call on those opposite to join us rather than sniping from the far side of the House.  They should join us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_973">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It is the main objective of the Bill and it is in the interests of society in general that the burden of costs of health insurance is shared between all people of the State, young and old.  There is no doubt that as with all forms of insurance there is an obvious economic and business motivation for companies to try to attract as many young, healthy people as possible and to seek to minimise the number of elderly people or people who may prove to be more expensive customers for other reasons.  The objective of the Bill is to try to redress this imbalance.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">There is no doubt that the provision of health insurance in the country must continue to be heavily regulated because of the natural competitive tendency that exists in all businesses.  There are few businesses more important than those that deal with the provision of health cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I accept many of the points made.  Without doubt we have a flawed health system which is in need of major surgery.  The private health insurance industry is one which, on the face of it, performs better but has many areas which need to be improved.  We have to acknowledge that we need to work very hard to protect people who do not avail of private health insurance, despite the fact that almost half the people in the State have health insurance.  That is why I welcome the provisions being put in place to strengthen protection.  Irrespective of risk, age or gender, after reasonable waiting times one can change insurance companies and be guaranteed to be delivered insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I want to touch on another area, the cost of health insurance.  I refer to the supply side.  The levels paid to our consultants and the cost of purchasing schemes from health insurers remains far too high.  One of the main reasons for this is that we still have a significant deficit in the supply of hospital and medical services.  There is a protectionist regime in the medical and hospital supply areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">In Cork a fully fitted hospital which cost tens of millions of euro is in a position to open under the management of the Mater Private clinic but the VHI has refused to cover it.  I understand the reason is primarily that it does not want to increase the supply within the south Munster area.  One has to consider why.  It may be because if more people were treated, the amount of money it would have to expend would increase in the short term.  I call on the Minister of State, as I have privately in the past called on the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to examine the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">When there are good, solid entrants who wish to engage at no cost to the State in the supply of perfectly good private medical services one health insurer should not be in a position to effectively block entry to the market.  It is a worrying development.  The cost of purchasing private health insurance requires us to examine the dynamic between demand and supply.  Even within the private health insurance market there is a limited supply which allows prices to be held at their current high rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">The Bill is a step in the right direction and does not obviate in any way, shape or form the ambition of the Government to achieve universal health cover but I concur that strong elements of the private health insurance industry remain broken and more remains to be done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_980">There are a lot of things which divide us in this House in terms of the policy and funding of social services.  One of the things on which we all agree, which is reflected across the political divide, is that the market alone cannot deal with the distribution of health care.  It simply cannot be done.  The pure form market is good at some things but is peculiarly bad at the distribution of social services, including health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">As far back as 1993 or 1994, all parties in this House recognised that because it was then that the evolving system of so-called risk equalisation was introduced.  There was a recognition across the political spectrum and in the community that we could not have a situation where people who are a greater risk, because of age or inherent illness, would have to pay more.  We should spread the risk across society, the community and generations.  That is why we have the useful and laudable notion of intergenerational solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">It is important to reflect on the view that the market is not the place where the problem can be solved but it has a role.  Our discussion on universal health insurance is a recognition of that.  Intergenerational mobility concerns people who suffer illness or are older and should not be penalised for that.  I would add another category, namely the ability to pay.  It is the great additional category which needs to be added to the equation and what brings us to universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">President Obama had big battles in the US in the past two years.  He was insistent that people who could not afford to pay for their health care should be brought into the system and that there should be a reliable and robust system of funding for health care which did not discriminate against people on the basis of ability to pay.  The battle focused on the basic health services required.  Luxury care can be paid for if people have money to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">People should not be discriminated against in terms of the basics in any civilised health service on the grounds of ability to pay, any more than they should be discriminated against because of age or an inherent illness.  That is the one great additional step we need to take to get us to universal health insurance.  I have huge confidence in the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Reilly and the Government, arising from the commitments in the programme for Government, that we will make the giant leap to reach the stage where we have a fundamentally fairer system of health care in Ireland.  It will not be easy to achieve and will not happen quickly but a lot of the important work has already started.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">As others have said, the Bill is an opportunity to have a wider debate.  We are dealing with a relatively net issue.  It is essentially a continuation of an interim measure which was introduced by the last Government when the Supreme Court shut down the system of risk equalisation which had been put in place.  I remember having this debate with the former Minister for Health and Children in the Seanad.  I was surprised the then Government did not move more quickly to introduce a proper system.  I understand tax relief is available but it is a sticking plaster approach.  I mean no disrespect to the previous or current Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The Supreme Court did not completely shoot down the idea of community rating.  Its judgment had narrow grounds for rejecting the idea.  The Chief Justice said at the time and it was made clear in the judgment that it was possible to have a system of risk equalisation which did not offend the basic principles set out in the Act.  I am surprised the problem was not addressed then.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">A question has been troubling me.  The Minister said this Bill will be passed this year and a more permanent system will be put in place next year.  How does that fit in with our commitment to universal health insurance?  Why would we go down the road of doing all the work on risk equalisation and tidying the system to make it more robust when we are, in any event, looking at the bigger picture of universal health insurance?  I am not clear how the two things fit together.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">Now we are heading toward universal health insurance could we not live with a sticking plaster, given that we have had it for two or three years?  We could live with the sticking plaster for another couple of years in circumstances where we are introducing universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The are many reasons I am happy to see Fianna Fáil in opposition.  For the first time people like Deputy Kelleher will become involved in this important debate, as he did this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">He pointed to the reality of our two-tier health system.  I do not recall Fianna Fáil Members acknowledging that in the past.  The party effectively abandoned all health policy issues to the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, for six or seven years.  It offered no initiative in terms of health provision in general, how resources should be distributed, the role of the market and the benefits of universal health insurance.  I am not sure whether anything in this area was included in the party's election manifesto.  The Fianna Fáil Party removed itself entirely from the pitch in regard to health.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">As such, I welcome that party's return to the pitch.  As Deputy Buttimer said, this issue is too important to be solely a prerogative of the Government in terms of its planning.  Everybody should participate.  I very much agree with previous speakers that the market will not provide the solution.  The market is peculiarly unsuited to the issue of distribution of social services, particularly in regard to health.  We look forward to the Minister's proposals for a universal system of health insurance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is working tirelessly in regard to the primary care element of it.  I hope we can accelerate our move towards the new system rather than, as Deputy Ó Caoláin suspects may be the case, allowing any delay in doing so.  It is a hugely important objective for this Government and I very much welcome the Minister's commitment to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_992">I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy White.  When discussing health insurance and health services in general, we should bear in mind that every single person in this country will have to access the health sector in some form or other during the course of his or her lifetime, either on the way in or the way out.  It is an issue that affects everybody to a greater or lesser extent.  All of the young people in the Gallery today either have been or will be beneficiaries of the health service, and that must be paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">In recent years we have seen a shift away from the expectation that people can rely on the public health service to provide for their needs, with an alternative to be provided by the private sector.  Unfortunately, the two have crossed over each other and there is a severe degree of duplication.  I spoke on this issue back in the mid-1990s when the whole debate emerged about competition in the private health insurance sector and the sharing of the burden by new entrants.  We discussed at length the need for new entrants to recognise that everybody must carry a fair share of the burden, both new providers and those already operating in the market.  Unfortunately, that did not happen despite the existence of the sticking plaster legislation which we are proposing to extend.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her opening contribution to this debate last night.  It offered an excellent outline of the current system, the difficulties facing it and the need to address those issues as a matter of urgency.  Countless people throughout this country have made health insurance contributions over their lifetime, some of whom have been unfortunate enough to have to draw on the services provided.  Many VHI customers are now old, but they were not always so.  They made their contributions throughout the period in their life when it was expected that they would have little call on the system.  They made their payments consistently and it was a great burden to do so at times of very high taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">There are issues of serious concern in regard to the current dual system of provision.  For example, there was and is the suggestion that, in some cases, private health care is soaking up a disproportionate amount of available resources.  If that is allowed to continue, not only will we have a duplicate system, but also a hugely expensive one across the board.  If services can be provided, as has been alleged, at a much more competitive rate in other European countries, then something is wrong.  Why are we unique?  We are not so special that we should be treated differently from everybody else.  It is well known that there are health systems in other European countries and beyond which work effectively and competitively and are very responsive to the needs of their population.  I do not see any reason that we, at this stage of our development, cannot provide a service equal to any of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">We have a year or two to contemplate what should be done.  There is one certainty in this; if we do not eliminate duplication, overlap and double payment by the consumer into the system, we are doomed.  The universal health insurance system, as proposed by Government, is the right approach.  Everybody is entitled to a basic level of cover and a basic level of service thereafter.  If that provision is not in place, only the people who can afford it will be sure of obtaining service.  That is not acceptable in a republic.  We are still in control of our own destiny to some extent.  The part which nobody can explain is that we were able to provide all of these services many years ago.  Despite the public and private contributions made over many years and the fact that we allegedly have a sophisticated health system, we cannot provide the same level of response we were able to provide 25 or 30 years ago.  Some of us might know the reason for that, and it is being worked on by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I fully agree with Deputy White that it is deeply sad that Fianna Fáil, a party which represented a broad spectrum of society for many years, failed to exert its representational authority by asserting to its erstwhile colleagues in government that there was an obligation to provide for all of the people in so far as possible from the resources available to us.  That was never done and I cannot understand why.  Fianna Fáil Members, of all people, should have understood the importance of doing so.  I welcome Fianna Fáil's return to this debate.  It is hugely important for the benefit of this country and its people.  I support the proposal outlined in the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
          <p eId="para_998">I thank all of the Members who engaged in the debate.  The provisions of this Bill are exclusively technical in nature, providing for a one-year extension of the interim scheme of age-related tax credits and the community rating levy for 2012.  It includes several small modifications to the scheme to allow for a more precise level of support for community rating.  That is the purpose of the Bill and it does not pretend to do anything more than that.  It simply deals with a situation that must be dealt with for the coming year.  The broader issues in regard to risk equalisation will be dealt with over the course of the coming year by the Minister for Health.  The concept of risk equalisation will be more vital than ever in the context of a universal insurance health system, and the programme for Government includes a commitment in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Section 2 of the Bill amends section 6 of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2009 by providing a revised definition for "age group" and a new definition of "type of cover".  These definitions will facilitate the provision of information broken down by each year of age and also by specific health insurance contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Section 3 amends section 7 of the Act to provide for more detailed information returns to be submitted by health insurers to the Health Insurance Authority.  The information returns will be broken down further by each year of age, as required, and also by type of health insurance cover.  That will provide very important data to which we do not currently have access.  In addition, regulations made under section 7 may require separate returns in situations where the benefits payable under a type of cover have materially changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Section 4 amends section 7 of the Act to provide broader scope to the Health Insurance Authority in terms of using additional relevant information alongside the formal information returns submitted by the health insurers.  This will assist the authority and the Minister in performing their respective functions under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Section 5 amends section 470B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to make the necessary changes required to extend to 2012 the age-related tax credit in respect of private health insurance premia paid by persons aged 50 years and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">Section 6 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to provide for the continuation in 2012 of the collection of an annual levy on health insurance companies based on the number of lives covered by policies underwritten by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">I am in complete agreement with the many comments of Members in respect of the unfair nature of our health service.  It is because both parties to this Government are so concerned about the unfair nature of the health service and the great difficulty which so many people encounter in accessing the service and the unacceptable delays involved in accessing vital services that this Government is committed to introducing fundamental reform to the health service.  Both parties in Government had substantial policy documents on the health service prior to the election and in the context of the negotiations for the programme for Government, the health area was the area of most concern to both parties.  A substantial element in the programme for Government deals with the kind of health reform programme to which the Government is committed.  I wish to make it clear there is no argument in this regard.  The current situation where many aspects of our health service are dysfunctional and where it operates in an entirely unfair manner, is completely unacceptable to this Government.  This is the reason we are so determined to introduce the kind of fundamental reform that is required in order to introduce a fair system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The aim of the reform is to deliver a single tier health service which will ensure equal access to care, based on a person's need and not on their income.  The programme for Government provides for this in a universal health insurance context.  We are realistic in stating that these reforms cannot be introduced overnight.  They are major reforms.  What is involved in turning around the big ship of the health service requires very detailed preparation and very intensive work over a period of time.  It is for this reason we are setting as an objective the introduction of universal health insurance at an early stage in a second term of government.  If we suggested it could be done this year or next year, it is quite clear we would not be able to deliver such a commitment because it is not possible to do so in such a short timescale.  For this reason we are being ambitious but also realistic in setting a medium-term timescale in order to introduce full universal health insurance.  This is the responsible attitude for the Government to take and it is realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">However, there are a number of important stepping stones along the way and each of these will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.  First, significant reform of the acute hospital system is planned.  The special delivery unit was established in June 2011 to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  It undertook its work to put in place a systematic approach as a priority to eliminate excessive waiting times in emergency departments.  This is probably the one major complaint we hear from our constituents and it was identified as an absolute priority.  The special delivery unit is establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis, hospital by hospital, so we can know the situation in real time.  It is quite incredible that this information is not available to us but new systems have had to be implemented in order to collect these important data.  This will allow us to begin to embed performance management into the system in order to sustain shorter waiting times.  If we have learned anything over the past decade, we should have learned that throwing money at problems in the health service will not solve those problems.  We need to introduce fundamental reform to which the Government is committed but we need to have accurate data systems in place in order to be fully informed.  It cannot be a question of money going into a black hole without knowing what that expenditure is achieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The establishment of the special delivery unit necessitates alterations in the current role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, whose resources have been refocused to align closely with the work of the special delivery unit and to allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the country's hospitals.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is proactively working with the special delivery unit and the HSE to achieve the best possible results for patients.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is working to support hospitals in the delivery of a 12-month maximum waiting time for inpatient or day case surgery by 31 December 2011.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has stated on a number of occasions that he is committed to meeting that objective.  We expect to be able to move forward to reduce further that waiting time, year by year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">A further critical aspect of reform of the acute hospital system is the implementation of a new, more efficient funding system for hospital care which will be a mechanism whereby money follows the patient.  It will include a purchaser and provider split, whereby hospitals will be established as independent, not-for-profit trusts.  Various initiatives to facilitate achievement of the money follows the patient funding system are already under way.  These include a patient-level costing project to track resources actually used by individual patients in hospitals and a pilot project on prospective funding of certain elective orthopaedic procedures at selected sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">We have to know that an amount of money being spent on particular procedures is providing value for money.  For instance, if a block of funding is given to a hospital we will know how many hip operations this money will buy.  It is not just a question of allocating a lump sum of money to a hospital and hoping it will carry out as many procedures as possible.  The funding must be much more targeted in its allocation while ensuring that best value is achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The reform agenda also involves enhancing and greatly expanding capacity in the primary care sector in order to deliver universal GP care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This Government is absolutely committed to delivering on that element of the reform agenda in the short to medium term.  The full universal health insurance is a medium-term project which is well under way but the reforms promised on opening universal access to GP care are reforms we intend to deliver within this term of Government.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals.  Taking this step will allow us to move away from the old hospital-centred model where health care was episodic, reactive and fragmented.  We aim to deliver a more proactive, joined-up approach to the management of our nation's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">A total of 80% of health activity relates to chronic disease.  It is the intention of this Government to move the vast bulk of chronic disease management away from hospitals to the local primary and community care setting.  This is how real reform can be introduced to the health service.  Unfortunately, as it works currently, fees act as a significant barrier for people in accessing care when a condition develops.  In many cases, people cannot afford the fee of €45 to €55 for a GP visit.  This problem is increasingly common and people are putting off having conditions seen to in the hope that the symptoms will go away.  In many cases where people decide to neglect early symptoms, they inevitably end up with poorer outcomes and a more serious condition requiring more expensive care, frequently in an accident and emergency unit or through admission to hospital.  The purpose of the reform provided for in the programme for Government is to have early intervention to encourage people to access care at an early stage and achieve better outcomes, earlier diagnosis and a much more user friendly health service.  This also entails having a much more cost effective health service.  This is what we intend to achieve in the term of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">To respond to some of the points speakers made, given the complex nature of what is planned, the Government has approved the establishment of and terms of reference for an implementation group on universal health service.  The details of the group are being finalised and it will commence work shortly.  Its work will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance in the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  This important legislation deals with a specific issue and should be considered in the context of the overall reform agenda to which the Government is fully committed.  I am aware that Deputies opposite are also committed to introducing these types of reforms.  As I stated, they should not expect us to have completed the task in the first nine months of the Government.  Considerable work is under way and I hope Deputies will start to see the benefits of this work from next year onwards as we start to roll out the commitments contained in the programme for Government.  I hope at that stage the Opposition will give us some credit for the work we are doing.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_1023">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, for coming to the Chamber for this debate.  The Vartry tunnel is a 4 km long, rock lined tunnel built in the 1860s which runs through the Wicklow Mountains.  It supplies water from the Vartry reservoir to more than 150,000 homes in south County Dublin and north County Wicklow.  I am deeply concerned by reports that a faultline has been identified in the rock which may result in the collapse of the tunnel at any time.  The tunnel has been listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's list of facilities requiring remedial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The Minister, Deputy Hogan, will appreciate that this is a matter of considerable urgency.  Some 80 million litres of water flow through the tunnel on a daily basis, representing approximately 20% of the total supply of water to the greater Dublin area, including towns like Bray and Greystones.  If the tunnel collapses, which could occur without any warning, no alternative water supply will be available to service houses and businesses currently served by the Vartry tunnel.  Not only would this be a huge inconvenience for many families, but it would also raise significant health and safety concerns.  I understand from media reports that in the event of such a collapse, it could take months or years to restore the water supply to the affected areas.  I hope the Minister can allay my fears in that regard.  At a time when the Government is rightly doing everything it can to protect jobs and promote employment, this is an additional worry for local businesses in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">I ask the Minister to ensure the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency take pre-emptive action now so alternative measures can be put in place in the event that the Vartry supply experiences difficulty.  I understand that Dublin City Council has made proposals in this regard, involving the development of a 1 km bypass pipe that would run parallel to the existing pipe.  I hope the Department will engage constructively with the council on this so the minds of my constituents in north Wicklow can be put at rest.  I recognise there are competing demands for investment in water supplies in different parts of the country.  I appreciate that the level of investment in our water infrastructure was inadequate when this country was experiencing an economic boom.  It is a matter for the Minister to try to right those wrongs in extremely difficult circumstances.  I know he is aware of the need for significant improvements in our water infrastructure.  I have spoken to him at length on the matter.  Water shortages are becoming increasingly frequent, particularly in winter.  Significant leakage across our water network remains a real problem.  I believe this unique and pressing case merits the immediate attention of the Minister.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1026">I thank Deputy Harris for giving me an opportunity to outline my position on this important subject, which clearly demonstrates the importance of water volumes and water quality for the community in general.  I will continue to prioritise capital funding under my Department's water services investment programme, which is clearly underpinned by the need to address deficiencies in quality and security of water supply.  This is in line with the risk-based approach that has been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency since 2008, whereby it has listed public water supplies that require corrective action on a remedial action list.  Under the 2010-12 water services investment programme, some €285 million has been set aside for contracts to start for water supplies on the remedial action list.  A further €28 million has been allocated under the rural water programme since 2008 for smaller works that are required.  The EPA report that was published yesterday, The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Year 2010, indicates that good progress has been made in addressing supplies on the remedial action list.  Of the original 339 supplies on the list, 166 have been removed with works to be completed on a further 136 by the end of 2011.  Action programmes are in place for most of the remaining supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">I assure Deputy Harris that an action programme is in place for the Vartry supply, backed by funding from my Department.  I am disappointed that the EPA has reported slow progress on addressing issues with this supply.  The Vartry supply has served the citizens of parts of Dublin and Wicklow for over 140 years.  It supplies 80 megalitres of potable water to 335,000 people every day.  In 2007, my Department approved a preliminary report which recommended the replacement of the existing Vartry tunnel with a new 4 km tunnel on a direct line from Vartry waterworks to Callowhill, at an estimated cost of €19.4 million.  A planning stage budget has been approved.  The project is included in the water services investment programme as a project to advance through planning.  My Department is awaiting the submission of contract documents from Dublin City Council to enable the scheme to proceed to construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Dublin City Council has proposed an advance works project to mitigate the risk to public health that was identified by the EPA, pending the construction of a new tunnel, by providing UV treatment at Callowhill.  As part of the review of the water services investment programme earlier this year, this contract was added to the water services investment programme, as a contract to start, at a cost of €1.5 million.  I understand the city council is working on detailed proposals for this project.  My Department has also approved funding for a number of additional project staff for the delivery of water services capital projects in Dublin, including the Vartry tunnel replacement project.  Capital investment in water services is being given a high priority by the Government, with €371 million being provided in 2012.  The next stages of the action plan for the Vartry tunnel replacement and the more immediate works at Callowhill will be a priority for funding within the available resources as they are developed by Dublin City Council.  I urge the council to finalise these proposals as quickly as possible.</p>

Many of my constituents — the Ceann Comhairle's constituency of Dún Laoghaire is served by a similar supply — will be astonished and annoyed to learn that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has allocated funding and made provision for additional staffing measures and that a preliminary report was approved in 2007.  People woke up yesterday, in 2011, to read in the national newspapers that the north Wicklow water supply could be affected by these problems at any stage.  I am encouraged by what the Minister has said.  I would like to add my voice to the Minister's call for Dublin City Council and Wicklow County Council to get involved as quickly as possible.  I would like the Minister to ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to contact Dublin City Council to see if progress can be made on this matter as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">I accept that legitimate concerns have been raised about the supply of drinking water to parts of Wicklow and Dublin from the Vartry supply.  I reiterate my firm commitment to the advancement of proposals, including those in the action programme, aimed at addressing these deficiencies.  I want infrastructural provision in the water sector to be accelerated.  Important decisions on the reform of the sector will be made from this perspective in the coming months.  We will build on the existing strengths of the current system to achieve our goals.  Projects in the current water services investment programme will form part of our investment plans under any structural arrangements.  Important projects, such as the replacement of the Vartry tunnel, need to be advanced as quickly as possible.  The Government has committed to invest €1.6 billion in capital funding in water services between 2012 and 2016.  I urge all authorities, including Dublin City Council, to press on with the delivery of priority projects.  I can confirm that I will contact the local authority in the Deputy's area to see what can be done to expedite the proposals that have been mentioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">We have had enough of that today.  A 68-acre site was purchased by IDA Ireland in 2002.  It was intended that a great new technological park for the town of Mullingar would be developed on the site.  Permission was granted to install all services on the site in 2003.  The park is now fully served by road, broadband, electricity, public lighting and footpaths.  The attention to detail was such that the park even has a bus stop.  Permission was subsequently granted for two units in an effort to attract new business to the town.  The park is totally empty today, however.  It is being used for grazing purposes.  I wonder how much those grazing cattle are costing the Exchequer.  Historically, the people of Mullingar have not had good experiences with IDA Ireland.  In 1997, IDA Ireland announced that Oxford Health Plans was planning to locate in Mullingar and intended to employ 500 people.  The firm had 40 staff in Mullingar at first and increased this to 180 before it closed its doors two years later.  Similarly, the Hon Hai Precision Industry Company located in Mullingar in 1999 to great fanfare but little came of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">I have submitted a number of parliamentary questions on this matter since I was elected to the Dáil.  Most recently, in October of this year, I asked the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to state the number of visits by potential clients to the IDA Ireland park in Mullingar that had taken place since February 2011.  The Minister said in reply that he had been "informed by IDA Ireland that so far in 2011, the agency has hosted three site visits by potential investors to Mullingar".  That is nothing short of disgraceful and shameful, particularly when one examines the site visit figures for other IDA Ireland parks in the region.  When representatives of IDA Ireland addressed Westmeath County Council on 11 May last, they said there is no such thing as a fair share or an equal slice when it comes to bringing direct investment and jobs to Mullingar.  IDA Ireland should market Mullingar as a priority location in keeping with its stated policy objective of balanced regional development and delivering 50% of projects to regions outside Dublin.  What has Mullingar done wrong?  It is strategically placed in the centre of Ireland and is well-serviced by a road infrastructure.  Travel times from Mullingar to Dublin Airport and Dublin Port are two hours, an hour and a half to Galway, two hours to Belfast and two and half hours to Cork.  Rail services have been improved over the past several years.  Mullingar has a well-educated workforce and is close to major third level institutions such as Athlone Institute of Technology, which celebrated its 40th anniversary as seen on "Nationwide" recently, and NUI Maynooth which is only 30 minutes away.  However, IDA Ireland still treats us as second-class citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">The Government recently decided to close the Army barracks in Mullingar with the relocation of 200 jobs.  In its capital expenditure plan, it announced it would discontinue with the decentralisation of Department of Education and Skills offices to the town with a further loss of 300 jobs.  While most decentralisation programmes were a bit airy-fairy, I was informed the Mullingar proposal was the most subscribed of all the plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">Who will take control of IDA Ireland, as it seems to be a law unto itself?  Will the Minister inform me what Mullingar needs to do for IDA Ireland to stop ignoring a business park in the town in which it has invested millions of euro?  The agency has failed abysmally in attracting jobs to Mullingar or to work with Enterprise Ireland or the local enterprise boards.  It has hoarded this business park away for itself.  Several companies have approached the agency to purchase units in the business park, only to be refused unless they had IDA Ireland approval.  As the Minister knows, opening up just one unit can have a knock-on effect with other businesses opening in the vicinity.  What are the Government's plans for job creation and investment in Mullingar?  What are the Minister of State's proposals for this 68 acre functional business park, along with those of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which is still being used to graze cattle?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_1037">I thank Deputy Troy for raising this matter.  I have some sympathy for his position as I understand the frustration of any Deputy who represents areas outside of the large urban conurbations when it comes to attracting inward investment to their business parks.  I too have had words with the agency when it comes to its policy of attracting inward investment to places other than the larger urban conurbations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">IDA Ireland's property portfolio comprises approximately 1,240 ha.  Under section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 the agency has responsibility for managing its property programme which consists of the acquisition and disposal of land, the development and servicing of land and the provision of building solutions.  The programme has been designed specifically to support the promotion of Ireland and its regions as a suitable location for foreign direct investment, FDI, by providing tailored property solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">The midlands region is a priority for IDA Ireland and it is continuing to market the region, including Mullingar, to its existing clients and to potential new investors.  In line with the national spatial strategy and IDA Ireland's strategy, Horizon 2020, IDA Ireland is focused on advancing regional economic development, primarily through gateway locations and in the midlands this includes Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">IDA Ireland has invested heavily in the business and technology park in Mullingar to make it more attractive to overseas clients.  The agency has confirmed that it will continue to promote this park and other local private property options to secure new investments for Mullingar and its surrounding areas.  As Ireland competes for high-end investments, the concept of scale is crucial to success.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talented people, effective physical and digital infrastructure, coupled with the availability of sophisticated support services, an attractive quality of life and proximity to third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">IDA Ireland is actively marketing the midlands gateway through its network of overseas offices and is in regular engagement with all local economic stakeholders including local authorities, midlands gateway chamber, county development boards, academia and Enterprise Ireland to develop constantly the value proposition for the midlands and to provide the most attractive conditions for growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute from within the midlands gateway.  IDA Ireland considers a project win in one midlands town to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">As well as marketing the region for new greenfield investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to deepen their mandate in Ireland and to continue to reinvest in their sites in the region.  This encourages further business in areas which are compatible with our skills base and which are sustainable within our economy in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The strategy of developing lands and property in advance of securing new business has been a fundamental and successful tool in the IDA's marketing to overseas clients.  The ready availability of property solutions often eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property and for completing necessary development work.  It also allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating many of the potential difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">It is an accepted that the role of IDA Ireland in making available appropriate and timely property solutions tailored to the needs of prospective multinational clients has been a key contributor to winning FDI to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">I have been informed some clients tend to opt for site locations in larger urban areas.  I agree with the Deputy that there must be a meaningful dialogue with IDA Ireland around the designation of hubs in attracting inward investment to sites such as the one in question.  There may also be a need to examine more closely how these sites can be better utilised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1047">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.   IDA Ireland's policy states it would be in keeping with the authority's stated policy objective of balanced regional development to have 50% of projects delivered to regions outside Dublin and Cork.  The Minister of State correctly pointed out that the midland region is receiving investment and he stated the gateway hub of Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar is being looked after, but only two of those towns are being looked after.  There is no IDA Ireland development in Mullingar.  He also referred to proximity to third level institutions.  The availability of a highly educated workforce is of huge importance to potential investors.  The town is well located with AIT down the road and NUI Maynooth up the road, both only a 30 minute drive away.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">According to reports regarding the upcoming budget, no grants will be made for fourth level education and that will have a detrimental affect on IDA Ireland's efforts to attract foreign direct investment.  If the student registration charge is increased further, it will also have a detrimental effect because young people will be disincentivised to attend third level and educate and upskill themselves to a level that would attract foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Will the Minister of State take a personal interest in the site in Mullingar?  I am sure he will visit the region.  When he does so, will he visit the IDA Ireland park in Mullingar to see first hand how well located and serviced it is and how quickly it could be made ready and available to a potential client?  IDA Ireland should look outside its own parameters regarding this park.  It seems to covet the site because no one else can get a look in.  The authority has had it for the past 11 years and it has not attracted any company.  Enterprise Ireland, the local authority, the county enterprise board and community organisations should be given the opportunity to avail of it and let whichever group comes forward with a reasonable suggestion use it.  If that means they have to be given the site without paying for it, so be it.  Captains of industry who are prepared to take risks and invest their own capital in line with their entrepreneurial spirit to create jobs in our locality should be let on to the site.  People need to be incentivised to spend their own money to create jobs because the State will not do so.  The State needs to introduce policies to incentivise people to generate job creation using their own wealth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Will the Minister of State give a commitment to do this, especially given the recent decision to close the Army barracks in Mullingar and to cancel the decentralisation of the Department of Education and Skills to the town?  The town has lost 500 jobs.  IDA Ireland says it prioritises areas that have suffered job losses.  Mullingar must be at the top of the list if that is the authority's criterion.</p>

If one considers this from the vantage point of companies that may invest inward, they do not necessarily look at county boundaries or constituencies and, therefore, if they are considering the midlands gateway, they will look at the towns, in particular, not the county boundaries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I take what the Deputy said in good faith.  Given that Mullingar has a strong stakeholder forum, I respectfully suggest it should take up the cudgel through its local public representatives to forge a closer link or dynamic with IDA Ireland in respect of the issues he has outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">With regard to a site visit, I can bring this to the attention of the Minister.  I have visited AIT and NUIM.

            <p eId="para_1055">There is merit in the Deputy's contribution.  There has to be a dialogue around these sites throughout the country and how they are marketed and utilised.  We need a discussion about a more lateral approach and if a set of potential investors locally or a set of stakeholders or entrepreneurs who are from without the IDA Ireland portfolio want to engage, an approach should be made to the authority to discuss the potential of the land use.  I fail to see why that could not happen.  I thank the Deputy for raising these issues.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_421">
            <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy</from>
            <p eId="para_1056">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the issue of inter-country adoptions between Ireland and Ethiopia.  I refer to the difficulty being experienced by people who want to adopt children from Ethiopia because of the absence of a bilateral agreement.  The enactment of recent legislation in the area, while, by and large welcome, has effectively made it impossible for Irish couples to adopt Ethiopian children.  This not only poses obvious problems for first-time or prospective parents seeking to adopt from Ethiopia but it also means that Irish couples who have previously adopted an Ethiopian child and who may want to expand their family will not be in a position to adopt a second child from that country.  They are in a difficult space.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">In this context, I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to review this situation and specifically to begin negotiations with the Irish Ethiopian Adoption Organisation with a clear view to establishing a bilateral agreement between both countries.  Ireland has a positive history of adoption from Ethiopia going back over 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">The most recent figures indicate that between 250 and 300 adoptions of Ethiopian children by Irish parents have taken place during that period.  There are now in the region of 7 million orphans in Ethiopia.  Of that number, just over 3,000 Ethiopian orphans are currently the subject of intercountry adoptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">We have a duty to reach out to Ethiopia, which has a population of 80 million people.  We are facing into an extremely difficulty budget and our country is experiencing many economic and social problems.  Our concerns pale into insignificance when one considers the problems relating to poor education provision, health, shelter, sanitation etc., with which Ethiopia must deal.  The position in Ethiopia is not improving, it is getting worse.  Only 17% of Ethiopia is urbanised and the rate of youth unemployment there is worse than that which obtains anywhere else on the planet.  More than 1 million people in Ethiopia have AIDS or HIV and the country has endured its own well-publicised share of civil conflict in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">As the Minister is aware, Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions in 2010.  The enacting legislation, the Adoption Act 2010, came into force on 1 November of last year.  The Hague Convention establishes minimum standards for the protection of children and eliminates various abuses previously associated with the intercountry adoption process.  In that context, the ratification of the convention and the accompanying  legislation are to be warmly welcomed because they ensure that high standards and specifications are applied to the intercountry adoption process at all times.  In addition, the best interests of the children involved are placed above all other considerations.  Section 40 of the Adoption Act stipulates that, in respect of intercountry adoptions, only children from contracting states may be adopted by Irish couples.  The only other avenue by means of which Irish couples may adopt children is if they come from a country that has a bilateral agreement with this State.  That Ethiopia has limited resources means it has been unable to ratify the Hague Convention.  As a result, and in order for adoptions to continue into Ireland from Ethiopia, a bilateral agreement between the two countries must, as required under the Adoption Act, be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">It is important to point out that the Hague Convention allows for adoptions to countries which have not ratified the convention.  As already stated, the Adoption Act 2010 allows for bilateral agreements with such countries.  As far as I understand it, Ireland is the only country which has restricted adoptions to countries which have ratified the convention and which will not allow adoptions — carried out to Hague standards — from non-contracting states with bilateral agreements.  Significantly, countries which have ratified the Hague Convention — the UK, Belgium, Norway, Sweden and Germany — facilitate adoptions from Ethiopia, despite the fact it has not yet ratified the convention.  Furthermore, Australia has a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia.  I am of the view that the position with regard to Australia could be mirrored in Ireland.  While this country currently has no bilateral agreements, history shows that the now expired bilateral agreement with Vietnam was an exceptionally positive collaboration.  As a result, there is no reason an equally productive link could not be established with Ethiopia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">It is worth noting that 80% of all intercountry adoptions worldwide are from countries which have not ratified the Hague Convention and 20% are from those which have ratified it.  There are many families in Ireland which are, for one reason or another, seeking to adopt Ethiopian children but which are being prevented from doing so.  There is an easy remedy to this situation.  I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to agree to a request from the Irish Ethiopian Adoption Organisation to have a meeting with her and to authorise the Adoption Authority of Ireland to commence negotiations with the Ethiopian authorities on establishing a bilateral agreement with Ireland.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_422">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1063">I am taking this matter, which is of great interest to many Members, on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I thank Deputy McCarthy for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">There was a fundamental change to adoption in Ireland with the commencement of the Adoption Act 2010 and the coming into force of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions on 1 November of last year.  In the context of intercountry adoption, Ireland has now signed and ratified the Hague Convention, which aims to promote the highest standards and best practice in intercountry adoption.  The practice of intercountry adoption is not without risk.  The Hague Convention seeks to minimise that risk, with those countries who are party to it working in collaboration in order to build confidence in the process in both sending and receiving countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">The Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, is the central authority for this country with regard to intercountry adoption.  As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in respect of such adoption, the AAI has indicated that its first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other countries which have ratified the convention.  Representatives of the AAI recently returned from the USA and intend to develop an administrative arrangement with that country in respect of intercountry adoption.  In the coming weeks, these representatives also intend to visit Mexico and Vietnam in the context of entering into administrative arrangements with both jurisdictions.  An arrangement with the latter will be dependent on the entering into force of the Hague Convention in Vietnam on 1 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">The Minister has been informed by the Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa — it is of assistance that we have an embassy there — that the Ethiopian Government is strongly committed to protecting the best interests of the child and that the ratification of the Hague Convention is an objective for it.  While the Ethiopian authorities are supportive of the goal of Hague-compliance, it seems likely that it will take time for them to put in place arrangements to allow for their ratification of the convention.  UNICEF is working closely with the Ethiopian authorities to support the development of enhanced policies and programmes in support of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">As well as providing for the ratification of the convention, the Adoption Act also provides that we may, as Deputy McCarthy noted, enter into bilateral agreements with countries such as Ethiopia which have not ratified the Hague Convention.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states which have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010, which states "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State".  The opening of negotiations on such a bilateral agreement would require an analysis of the current situation regarding adoptions in Ethiopia; issues regarding the compatibility of the laws between the two countries; and the plans of that jurisdiction <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">In the context of Ethiopia, the AAI has given preliminary indications that certain issues — particularly those relating to the effect of Ethiopian adoptions in the context of the Adoption Act 2010 — which will require detailed consideration are likely to arise.  It is also acknowledged that the adoption process is a tremendously emotional journey to which legal rigour must, in the best interests of the child and all other parties to an adoption, be applied.  Add to this the period of change the Adoption Act 2010 has induced and the result is a very difficult and demanding landscape for prospective adoptive parents.  There are few certainties or guarantees and, on occasion, governments in both sending and receiving countries may make decisions about what is in the best interests of children that will give rise to concerns on the part of prospective adoptive parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">The Minister is extremely conscious that the AAI has a full work programme in the terms of Hague countries, as well as the important upcoming priority of engagement with Vietnam.  In addition, the AAI and officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will be undertaking exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in the coming weeks.  The AAI must also prioritise checks of legal compatibility with a wide range of jurisdictions in order to process applications for the recognition of the adoptions of children already adopted from abroad by Irish citizens.  These are desktop reviews in respect of which legal advice is needed.  They are urgently required in order to regulate the status of children already adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">The Minister has sought an update on Ethiopia from the AAI and the Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa to assess possible next steps <i>vis-à-vis</i> that jurisdiction.  However, further action must have regard to the wider work programme of the AAI and its agreed priorities.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy</from>
            <p eId="para_1071">I thank the Minister, Deputy Burton, for taking this topical issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">It is clear from her reply that there is a legislative framework which will allow the inter-country adoptions to take place, leaving aside the difficulties Ethiopia may be experiencing in ratifying the Hague Convention.  There is a legislative framework and provision to allow us proceed with a bilateral agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">We have an embassy in Addis Ababa.  I am happy to see that the Minister has sought an update, both from it and from the adoption authority but I have two specific requests.  First, I urge the Minister concerned, Deputy Fitzgerald, to meet the Irish Ethiopian Adoption Association and resolve the remaining issues.  Second, I urge her, as is only right and proper, to allow the bilateral agreement to take place so that we can promote families coming together and allow people in this country who want to adopt an Ethiopian baby the joy and happiness that such adoption will bring to their lives.  It will also allow those who have already adopted children from that country to expand and develop their family unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">We are living in difficult times but this is a good news story.  It is a good story for children and for families.  It is something that the Government needs to pursue with a considerable degree of enthusiasm, compassion and speed.  The apparatus and legislative framework are in place.  What we need is a political push.  We have an embassy in Addis Ababa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">The Minister, Deputy Burton, spent a significant period of her life in the continent of Africa.  She will be aware of the difficult social and economic issues challenging the livelihood of people in Ethiopia.  I ask her to urge the Government and her colleague to pursue this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">I would respectfully ask that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, would get back to me following the update that she has sought from the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia and having considered the possible next step.  The framework is in place and we need to push it in that direction.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_424" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1077">I will ask my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to give urgent consideration to the meeting Deputy McCarthy suggests with the Irish people interested in adopting from Ethiopia.  As I stated in the detailed reply, there is much work ongoing arising from the entering into force of the 2010 Adoption Act.  Also, Ireland has finally, after long years of discussion, signed up to the Hague Convention.  That is very helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">I have been in Ethiopia where there are, unfortunately, a number of children in orphanages.  Deputy McCarthy mentioned the figure of 3,000.  Where a child would otherwise spend his or her childhood in an orphanage, there is a strong case for facilitating a good quality home to adoptive parents who would love and look after that child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">I, myself, was adopted.  Of course, Ireland has a long history of adoption.  In the 1950s, we had children going to America to be adopted in the period after the Second World War.  We are not without our own history, including those children coming back subsequently to Ireland to look for their birth roots.  It is important in this instance that we look at the interests of everybody, foremost of which are those of the child, including, as I stated, the issue of a child being in an institution such as an orphanage for all of his or her childhood as opposed to finding a loving home.  The fact that we have an embassy in Ethiopia is helpful.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald to send Deputy McCarthy a report on the briefing that she gets from the embassy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The Minister has done much positive work since she took up office.  As a matter of interest, I received a table from officials from her Department outlining the numbers of registrations of adoptions from Ethiopia as follows: in 2011, 41; in 2010, 75; in 2009, 21; and in 2008, 26.  There is a history.  I am sure the Department will furnish Deputy McCarthy with the details of the non-Hague Convention adoptions from abroad.  The total of non-Hague Convention adoptions, according to this table, were: so far in 2011, 135; and in 2010, 168.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Clearly, now that we have signed up to Hague Convention, adoption is still continuing.  It is merely that the framework must meet the requirements of that convention and the sending country also must establish and meet fairly stringent requirements on its side.  That is in the best interest of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">I will raise what Deputy McCarthy has said with the Minister.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1083">The website of the JobBridge scheme lists the following eligibility criteria: one must be unemployed and actively seeking work, and one must be on the live register and currently in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or signing for social insurance contribution credits for three of the past six months.  This appears fairly straightforward.  Unfortunately, it is not so.  Only when one reads the fine print of the scheme is it revealed that a person can meet these criteria and still be excluded, on the basis that the person is also in receipt of one parent family payment.  For the record, one can be in receipt of one parent payment and a reduced jobseeker's benefit payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">Therefore, single parents are obliged to give up their one parent payment if they wish to avail of the scheme.  This is unfair, discriminatory and detrimental, not only to the parent but to his or her child or children.  It must be remembered that the purpose of the one parent payment is to help the recipient provide for his or her child in the absence of income from a partner.  It is not a payment made solely for the benefit of the adult in the family.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">When my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, raised this matter with the Minister by way of parliamentary question, Deputy Burton's response was to state that "Individuals in receipt of One Parent Family Payment may access a wide range of activation supports including the FÁS Work Placement Programme".  However, the FÁS work placement programme is, according to the scheme's own website, "unpaid and voluntary".  In fact, participation in such a scheme may entail a net cost to the participant, particularly in rural areas such as my constituency where travel is likely to be involved, and costs such as lunches and child care.  The weekly JobBridge payment, €50, may be a pittance to some but at least it would go some way towards the costs of a person's involvement in the scheme.  The FÁS programme is not an adequate substitute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The problems this exclusion is causing are not hypothetical.  I received the following correspondence from a constituent in receipt of lone parent family payment and already participating in a work placement programme.  She writes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1087">It is beginning to get disheartening going into a job every day not getting paid.  I am struggling to get by.  I have not been able to pay my mortgage for months, I can't afford to tax my car at the moment, I have no oil for my house and it is starting to get colder.  I am at my wits end trying to figure out how I am meant to pay my bills, raise my two teenage sons, celebrate Christmas and put my son through college next year when all I am in receipt of is €247 a week from One Parent Family payments.  I get nothing from their dad and no other help.  My parents are unable to help me anymore as my dad is struggling to find work himself and I took up this work placement as a way to try and make a future for myself and my boys.  I am fighting back the tears typing this because I have always been such a self-sufficient person and I feel that I am now such a failure because I can't provide for my children.  I feel totally trapped and at a loss of what to do next.  If I leave my work placement, I blow any chance of getting a job in the future here but it is costing me money I don't have, to come to work every day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">I ask the Minister to consider sincerely the words I have read.  This constituent, who is well known to me and whose integrity I can confidently vouch for, is not only suffering financially because of her inability to access even the meagre payment available under the JobBridge scheme, it is also clearly causing her enormous emotional distress.  She is not alone.  I have no doubt that any Member in this House who talks to constituents will know of cases similar to that I have outlined.  In the face of an economic crisis, the Government's policies are leading — I do not believe this in any way stretches the situation — to mental health issues for people.  That is a fact of life, very sadly, from the cohort and profile of cases that are coming to my office on a week-on-week basis.  I ask the Minister to sympathetically and compassionately respond to the appeal I have made.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_426" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1089">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this important issue in general and in particular for his constituent.  Earlier this year, the Government announced its jobs initiative, which was a major step in helping to get Ireland back on the road to recovery.  The Government's aim was to begin the process of restoring confidence in Ireland's economy, but also restoring hope and confidence in the huge number of people who currently find themselves out of employment.  JobBridge, the national internship scheme, is a key element of the jobs initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">Since its launch on 1 July this year, JobBridge has already achieved significant milestones.  As of last Friday, there are just under 2,600 internship opportunities being advertised on the JobBridge website, <i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>, and a total of 2,879 interns have actually commenced their internship.  These figures show the strong level of interest in JobBridge, both from a host organisation perspective but also, importantly, from prospective interns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  JobBridge provides those seeking employment with the opportunity to undertake a six or nine month internship in a host organisation.  The scheme aims to offer individuals of all skill levels, ranging from those who left school early to highly qualified graduates and postgraduates, a unique opportunity to develop new skills to complement their existing skills and earn valuable experience.  Upon completing their internship, participants will have improved their prospects of securing employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">In the current labour market environment, JobBridge also provides individuals with a unique opportunity to secure work experience in a new field.  These could be people coming from the construction industry who no longer have employment and need to get into a new field.  The scheme enables people to break the cycle whereby unemployed people are unable to get a job without experience and cannot gain experience without a job, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers, like construction workers, whose existing skills need to be enhanced to ensure they stand the best possible chance of securing work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">In order to be eligible for the scheme, individuals must be in receipt of a live claim on the live register and have been receiving jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, or signing for social insurance contribution credits, for at least 78 days in the last six months.  The purpose of these eligibility criteria for the JobBridge scheme is to provide a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the live register so that, as employment opportunities become available, they are taken up by those on the live register.  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is imperative to keep those on the live register close to the labour market and to try to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  For these reasons, the eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the live register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for at least 78 days of the last six months.  In so designing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the live register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme, including its eligibility criteria, on an ongoing basis.  However, for the reasons outlined, there are no plans to amend the participant eligibility criteria.  I assure the Deputy we keep it constantly under review.  I have taken many queries and questions from Deputies in the House.  We have changed the scheme on an ongoing basis and we will have an evaluation system in place.  This has already gone to tender and it is a first in regard to social welfare that we would evaluate results as close as possible to people actually undertaking various activation programmes.  This is something people have spoken about over a long period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">JobBridge is the first initiative operated under the new national employment and entitlements service, which was a commitment contained in the programme for Government.  The implementation of this new service under the management of the Department of Social Protection is a crucial element of improved targeting of the resources applied to work placement, training and education for unemployed people and will provide the framework within which the reinvigorated national employment action plan will deliver activation policies and priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">Individuals in receipt of one-parent family payment have access to a wide range of activation supports.  The Deputy referred to the FÁS work placement programme, specifically in regard to his constituent.  The problem with the work placement programme is, as the Deputy pointed out, that there is no top-up payment and many people on that programme have opted, where they qualify, to transfer over to JobBridge.  I am continuing to keep all of this under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">We are constrained by the circumstances in which I got the go-ahead in Government to proceed with this scheme in the context of the discussions with the people from the troika, who want to see the activation of people on the live register.  Initially, we are confining it to such people because those are the terms and conditions.  However, I am keeping this constantly under personal review, as are the people on the steering group.  We meet very frequently to, as it were, gather all the experience of what works and what does not work.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">I outlined a previous reply by the Minister to my colleague, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh.  It was the Minister's reply that made reference to the FÁS work placement programme in the first instance.  Sadly, it has brought no benefit other than the experience itself in the particular case I cite.  With respect, although the Minister gave a lengthy, nine paragraph reply, it is only in the last paragraph that any reference is made to the situation in regard to one-parent family payment, which is the focus of my question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">There should be no mistake.  We were not, by any means, enthusiasts for the JobBridge scheme when it was first introduced.  We believed it was poorly designed and aimed at camouflaging the real situation in regard to the unemployment rate.  We argued it was not a substitute for a programme of job creation, which we do not believe the Government has seriously brought forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1102">I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.  We got the go-ahead for the scheme under the very stringent conditionality that it related to people on the live register, for reasons I am sure the Deputy appreciates and understands.  JobBridge is not for everybody, and I never claimed it was.  It is a specific initiative providing 5,000 places over a two year period.  It is very heavily subscribed, as the Deputy knows, and the feedback from it is quite positive.  An evaluation mechanism to be put in place has gone to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">I am keeping the scheme under constant review.  I am aware that some members of the Deputy's party are immensely critical of it, but it has a valuable role for people who are caught in the catch-22 situation of being unable to get a job because they do not have experience and being unable to acquire experience because they cannot get a job.</p>

            <p eId="para_1107">It is starting to feel a little like Groundhog Day, as Deputy Dara Calleary, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and I addressed this issue earlier this morning when we discussed the Supplementary Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">Arrangements have been made for the provision of additional funding for the Garda Vote in 2011 by way of the Supplementary Estimate which we dealt with earlier.  One of the main reasons for the Supplementary Estimate is to provide for an overrun on expenditure that has arisen in connection with the policing of the State visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama.  This situation has arisen because the visits had not been planned by the time the Garda Estimates for 2011 were finalised and the Supplementary Estimate will resolve the funding issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">At this stage the Supplementary Estimate has been considered by the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and I look forward to its early adoption.  Additionally, in the lead up to the Supplementary Estimate I have engaged very actively with my Government colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, regarding the costs of the State visits.  This has been an ongoing process and I am very pleased that it has been brought to a successful conclusion and that the funding required has been made available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">I put the question down in light of remarks the Minister made publicly last week, and we dealt with the issue this morning.  However, I am anxious to ensure that the allocation approved by the committee this morning will cover the exact cost of the visits.  The Minister referred to Garda efficiencies.  What are those efficiencies?  Do they include a cutback in policing programmes?  I realise that we went through the figures this morning, but will the Minister comment on Operation Freeflow and whether there will be one in Dublin this year?  Has it been curtailed as one of the Garda efficiencies?  Will any other programme be curtailed?</p>

            <p eId="para_1111">Additional costs of €36 million were incurred for the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama.  The original estimate was that the cost would be approximately €20 million.  The Queen's visit turned out to be a good deal longer than was originally anticipated and was most successful.  Efficiencies have been effected across the Garda Vote, as they have been effected across other parts of the justice Vote within the Department so matters could be dealt with in a more efficient and effective way.  I assure the Deputy that whatever outstanding funding the Garda requires arising from the visits is being provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The Garda has operated with great efficiency and effectiveness this year.  There has been a series of operations in which the Garda has targeted drug gangs and those engaged, for example, in the sale and smuggling of illegal fuel in this country.  The force will continue to work to the highest level of efficiency.  With regard to Operation Freeflow, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Usually there is an announcement in December about it and I anticipate that the Garda will take such action this year as is necessary to ensure that our roads are safe.  As I said earlier today, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of lives lost on our roads this year and in the number of road traffic accidents.  That is partly contributed to by the vigilance of An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_1113">The Garda Commissioner appeared before the committee this morning and we all took the opportunity to pay tribute to the Garda.  Will the Minister confirm that the €36 million cost of the two visits, and everybody agrees on the benefits of those visits, has been provided in full to the Garda and that no other Garda programme has been affected by that cost?</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_437" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1114">There was €36 million excess expenditure incurred within the Garda Vote because it was not anticipated that either visit would take place.  During the course of the year the Garda has effected efficiencies in the manner in which it has delivered its services.  The Garda has fully maintained all necessary front line services and has been particularly effective.  The additional sum of €27.4 million that has been allocated was discussed earlier today.  Approximately €15 million of that is directly in respect of the visits and the remaining sums were not required by the Garda because of the efficiencies that have been effected during the year.  It is not my purpose as Minister to provide the Garda with funding it does not require.  The funding it requires is being provided and front line services have been fully and properly maintained.  Efficiencies have been effected, which is in the interests of the taxpayers and of the Garda fulfilling its obligations to use resources in the most efficient and effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">As I said at the meeting of the justice committee, I pay tribute to the Garda Commissioner, the officers and all the members of the force for the manner in which they have dealt with a range of issues this year in a cost-effective way.  That is the way to proceed into the future.</p>

        <b> Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
          if his attention has been drawn to the fact that on 21 November 2011 open prisons Loughan House, County Cavan and Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow, were both under capacity; the reason overcrowding persists in prisons such as Mountjoy, Dublin, due to the imprisonment of large numbers of persons for minor offences who could be placed in open prison arrangements, while open prisons are generally under-utilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [38142/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_438" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1117">As I advised the Deputy in my answer to a parliamentary question on 22 November, we currently have two open centres in the prison estate and on 21 November 2011 Loughan House had 110 prisoners, filling approximately 70% of the bed capacity of 160, while Shelton Abbey had 97 prisoners, filling nearly 90% of the bed capacity of 110.  These figures do not include prisoners on temporary release that day; for example, six prisoners in Shelton Abbey were on weekend temporary release and were due back in custody later that day and 23 prisoners were on temporary release from Loughan House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">The average occupancy rates for Shelton Abbey for 2010 was 94% so it cannot be described as being under-utilised.  The occupancy rates for Loughan House would normally be in the region of 80%, for example, yesterday it was 83%.  Neither centre is a committal centre and, as open centres, they are only suitable for a limited category of prisoners, that is, low risk offenders serving short sentences or offenders nearing the end of longer sentences.  There is limited use for each of these prisons.  Many prisoners prefer to be in prisons close to their families and will simply abscond from open centres.  Open centres are not appropriate to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">While it is my policy to encourage the maximum use of open centres as appropriate, I recognise that they are not suitable for every prisoner and that their bed capacity only represents 6% of the total prison capacity.  As such, further maximising their use does not have the potential to have any significant effect on the pressures in the rest of the prison system.  However, open centres have a useful role to play and we need to make the most effective use of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">It is simply not true to say that prison overcrowding is due to the imprisonment of large numbers of persons for minor offences who could be placed in open centres.  An analysis of prisoner population and trends for the years 2005 to 2010 shows that the proportion of prisoners in custody on any one day serving sentences of less than 12 months has actually gone down over that period, from approximately 20% to 15%, while there has been a significant increase in the numbers serving sentences of three years or more.  We anticipate that the new arrangements made in respect of community service orders will further reduce the numbers of prisoners serving short-term sentences of less than 12 months.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_439">
            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1121">One of the reasons I tabled the question was because the figures we got from the answer to the parliamentary question were startling in terms of the bed capacity and the current population.  Now that the Minister has clarified that it did not include those on temporary release I can understand the reason the figures were so low on that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">As the Minister stated in his reply, open centres are the type of facility that foster training and education, help develop personal skills and help people make that transition.  Under the new five year capital strategy for the Irish Prison Service which is being developed, there will be greater focus on step-down facilities and possibly the greater use of open centres.  If the Minister has any information on that I would appreciate it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The other reason I put down the question is that when representatives of the Prison Officers Association came before a recent meeting of the Sub-Committee on Penal Reform they outlined in their submission that overcrowding could be addressed in a number of ways, one of which was greater use of open prisons, but they also stated that even within the closed prison system there is great scope to address some of the overcrowding.  The example given was Wheatfield Prison where there is a new prison block sitting idle.  There is a row of offices which are not being used and for a small amount of capital funding they could be converted and made suitable for some low-risk prisoners.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_440" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1124">That particular construction was built for offices as opposed to prison spaces but I am aware of it and it is something we are looking into.  As the Deputy may be aware, a review group is being established arising out of the Thornton Hall report to examine alternative ways of dealing with convicted offenders who do not pose a risk to the community and do an overall further review of non-custodial sentencing, and I expect that will be advanced in the new year.  I hope shortly to announce the names of the individuals who will conduct the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">Regarding Loughan House, one of the difficulties is its distance.  A substantial number of prisoners are in Dublin or Cork and there is an issue of prison visits and access for family members of those convicted.  Deputy Calleary is looking somewhat sceptical but that is an issue.  Open prisons have an important role to play but, unfortunately, a substantial number of prisoners are not appropriate to be serving their time in such prisons.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1126">To be clear, will part of the remit of the new policy review group the Minister is establishing be to examine existing prison structures and the possibility of expanding within those confines even, for instance, in terms of Castlerea Prison where there is a good deal of open space?  We could examine the possibility of doing something similar to what was done in the Six Counties where they put in temporary accommodation for low risk offenders.  Will that be part of its remit?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1127">The Thornton Hall review committee group looked beyond simply the question of the construction of Thornton Hall and addressing the problems arising out of Kilworth, in Cork.  It also examined some of the other means of dealing with prisoners but the review group will go beyond that and I hope shortly will be in a position to clarify its terms of reference.  I am anxious we deal with this in an open and constructive way and when that group is formed in the new year I invite Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Calleary to consider making their own submissions to it because I want us to examine the most constructive way of dealing with convicted offenders in a manner that is to the benefit of the community, ensures that taxpayers do not incur unnecessary cost and tries to reduce the level of recidivism.  I very much welcome the Deputy's contribution to that process.</p>

        <b> Deputy Clare Daly</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
          if he will consider halting the prison building plans at Dóchas and instead divert resources to provision of community based residential and therapeutic alternatives to prison for women, which are proven to be cheaper, more effective and more capable of addressing the complex needs of women offenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_443" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1129">On Tuesday, 29 November 2011, there were 127 prisoners in custody in the Dóchas Centre against a bed capacity of 105.  Since it opened in 1999, it has consistently had the highest level of overcrowding in the Irish prison system.  For that reason measures were taken to expand its capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">Work commenced in April 2011 on the conversion of an administrative building on the Dóchas Centre site into an accommodation block to provide an additional 70 spaces.  The building work has now been completed and it is expected that the spaces will be fully operational in early 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Women account for less than 4% of the prison population.  A review of the figures for October 2011 show an average of 155 female prisoners in custody in the Dóchas Centre and Limerick Prison.  Thirty-five of these women were on remand by the courts, a matter which falls wholly within the power of the Judiciary.  A further 85 women were serving sentences of one year or more for offences including a number serving life sentences for murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">It is my policy to maximise the non-custodial options for those found to have committed offences but only where a significant custodial sentence is not warranted.  This applies equally to men and women.  However, the remit of my Department is limited to offenders and we cannot duplicate or replace the supports that should be available to all in need of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The Probation of Offenders Act allows courts to discharge an offender subject to conditions rather than imposing a custodial sanction.  Conditions in such orders might include a requirement to be subject to supervision by the Probation Service and to participate in an appropriate treatment or rehabilitation course.  The Probation Service in co-operation with 48 community based organisations are currently spending in the region of €10 million providing services to adult offenders in the community some of which include residential courses.  Temporary release also allows suitable prisoners to be released from prison subject to conditions to participate in appropriate programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">I should say that in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group, I am establishing a group to carry out a strategic review of penal policy which will include specifically the issue of female prisoners.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_444">
            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_1135">I thank the Minister for the reply.  Overcrowding is a serious issue in all of the prisons and, as the Minister stated, especially in the Dóchas Centre but what has arisen out of this crisis is a shift in the ethos around which that facility was built, namely, the idea of a more open and rehabilitative process.  A consequence of the overcrowding is that it has been replaced by a somewhat more punitive regime which is hugely detrimental.  The Minister stated that over 85 of the women are serving sentences of one year or more but an analysis of the crimes that led them into that situation would reveal that most of them occurred as a consequence of drug use or abuse, poverty and so on.  Unless we tackle those issues building more spaces is the wrong way around that problem.  The idea of providing dormitory spaces for women prisoners, given the problems that have already arisen in the prison, is a recipe for disaster.  I note the Minister has said the building is built but is there any way we could alter that to have more single unit provisions because it will be a nightmare for the women and the staff?</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_445" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1136">All I can say to the Deputy is that I inherited the legacy of a prison that was inadequate in the context of the space provision available for women prisoners.  Very early action was taken to provide additional space, and that additional space should relieve the overcrowding and address what is the current difficulty in a manner that is manageable within the funding available to me.  The works started in April.  We expect those facilities will be in full use by early 2012.  It would have been impossible to have done anything quicker than that, and to have constructed a larger facility would not have been possible because of the absence of funding.  This is a measure designed to relieve the difficulties created by overcrowding, and I have confidence that the governor of the prison will ensure that those spaces are adequately allocated and utilised.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to take a large number of other measures with regard to adults — both men and women — who are imprisoned but it must be remembered that people are in prison for committing serious offences.  There are many people who come from difficult social backgrounds who do not engage in offending and assaults, who do not burglarise or commit theft, and to take it to its extreme, who do not murder people.  Prison has a role to play, but it is important we take a balanced and considered approach.  I am looking forward to the work that will be done by this new review group to see what other options we can also deploy in addition to the current non-custodial options that are being deployed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1137">Are the extra 70 dormitory spaces replacing the bunking up situation in the single cells?  A previous governor resigned over the totally inadequate nature of that provision.  Will that be discontinued as a result of these spaces?</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">Has the Minister obtained any information on how many current prisoners are reoffenders?  In my experience, many of the same people come back again.  If moneys were invested while they were in there to deal with some of the other problems, this would lessen the risk of reoffending and provide a considerable benefit.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1139">We all agree that the maximum possible needs to be done to ensure that those who are in prison for committing offences do not reoffend.  There will always be a significant segment of individuals who, no matter what services are available in the prison system, will still reoffend.  That is the lesson in every country in the world, no matter what type of sentencing regime they have.  However, the objective of prison must be to ensure that facilities are available to reduce the level of reoffending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The opening of these facilities should reduce the level of overcrowding within the Dóchas centre and I hope it will ameliorate the necessity for additional prisoners to be held in a prison cell which may have been originally designed for one individual.</p>

            <p eId="para_1142">A final decision on whether station closures will take place, and if so, what stations, will be taken in the context of the Commissioner's draft policing plan for 2012 and will be announced shortly.  The policing plan will also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">As with every other public sector organisation, the Garda Síochána is going to have to manage with reduced resources.   The Garda Commissioner has, therefore, quite properly been reviewing all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements and to maintain Garda front line services to the greatest extent possible, which is consistent with Government policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">I can confirm to the Deputy that I have received the Commissioner's draft policing report.  There are proposals on Garda stations which I hope to bring before my Cabinet colleagues early next week, and I expect announcements on the matter to be made next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_1145">We knew the Minster had the report as the Commissioner was with us this morning.  The one thing he did say is that there are not 240 stations recommended.  Can the Minister give us the overall amount?</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">Many local communities have the information.  They seem to know that their station is on the list, for whatever reason.  There is much genuine concern within rural communities, although the Commissioner made the point that he has not just targeted rural stations.  There is also an issue in respect of the visibility and presence of a Garda station and what it does to deter crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">The Minister made the point this morning at the committee that some stations on the list have been closed for 30 years, but they are in the minority.  There are many viable stations on that list which are currently providing a service.  In view of the way in which the criminal model is changing, the way in which they have greater access to different parts of the country, I would like the Minister to be very considerate of the impact of closing Garda stations in certain areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The OPW owns the properties to some extent, but the money for investing in these properties comes from the budget of the Department of Justice and Equality.  No savings will be made to the Department if these stations are closed, but the OPW will make the savings.  Why are we dismantling a Garda service to serve another Department's budgetary wants?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1149">I know the Deputy does not expect me to announce this afternoon which stations will close.  We have the Garda Commissioner's report and this has to go to the Cabinet before we make a final decision.  I am not being misleading in any way when I say to the Deputy that I am not in a position to make announcements until Cabinet colleagues have been made aware of the content of the report and a final decision has been made.  That decision will announced next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">There is no reason for any community anywhere in the country to be alarmed.  The proposals for closures do not apply to the very large numbers that some media outlets have been predicting.  The proposals are designed to ensure greater policing effectiveness and not less.  They are designed to ensure that members of the Garda Síochána are available for front line services and not engaged in administrative functions behind the desk at Garda stations that have very little footfall, or in circumstances where they would be better off out on patrol or engaging in investigation work.  The proposals also apply to stations that are in such close proximity to other stations that it simply makes no sense to have two stations so close to each other.  The major savings in this will be in more effective and efficient use of Garda time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">If Garda stations close, they are held by the OPW as they are the property of the State.  I am dependent on a decision being made by Cabinet colleagues on the use of funds that may arise from the disposal of buildings consequent on the closure of stations.  We have to address that issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1152">I welcome the fact that the Minister has confirmed the Cabinet will make the decision on the report.  Given that it is a Cabinet decision, perhaps it is time we looked at this across all Departments.  There are public buildings in every part of the country and every Department jealously protects those public buildings.  This issue came up this morning at the committee.  Why do we not look at those public buildings and use available space in them for a Garda presence?  Equally, we could look at using space in Garda stations for the presence of other organisations, such as Leader companies in offices held by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in rural areas.  If everybody gets out of this silo mentality in respect of State property, we can maintain services and a presence in a much more cost effective way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">I have a general view that silos are a bad thing, unless something is being stored in them.  Much to my surprise, I discovered in the review that some stations have not been opened for many years but have never been officially closed.  A formal announcement was never made about the consolidation of some Garda stations.  For example, I am aware of one station that has never officially been closed, but has not been open either since 1986.  It has had no Garda presence since then.  There are a small number of stations that are clearly not being used for policing purposes for a significant period of time.  It is a complete mystery to me why previous Governments did not dispose of those buildings at a time when funding could have been realised, or at least used for other purposes.  I hope to be in a position to address these issues when matters are decided early next week and announcements made.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_1155">It has been decided that funding to People with Disabilities in Ireland must cease at the end of 2011.  I would like to thank the members of PWDI and their staff for their efforts over the years, but in common with all aspects of Government spending, everything has to be examined with a view to preserving, so far as possible, front line services.  On the basis of a value for money review, it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PWDI is being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PWDI's annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration, rather than on the creation of programmes and services which would directly benefit people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">This was an untenable situation and could not be allowed to continue as people with disabilities were benefiting little from the allocation in real terms.  However, there is no reason that the local People with Disabilities in Ireland, PWDI, networks throughout the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies or should continue their work with people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities benefit directly from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major value for money and policy review of disability services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested to hear what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and I will chair a new national disability strategy implementation group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group will include representatives from several disability stakeholder organisations and also several people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience to bear directly on the important work of this high level group.  This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost-effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The Government must ensure that in 2012 and continuing thereafter funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  As can be seen from the following table, due to a general decline in network activity around the country, PWDI as an organisation was unable to spend its allocation in recent years.  More than €1 million allocated to PWDI since 2007 has been returned to the Exchequer.  Government funding for the years 2007 to September 2011, inclusive, is set out in the following table.</p>

It was not done to put her on the spot; it was simply that the question was submitted before I spoke to her.  I wish to know more about the reasoning behind it.  The Minister of State suggested that the majority of money was spent on administration and headquarters costs.  Is it possible to get some indication of what percentage of the funding was spent in these areas and what percentage was spent providing services?</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">As the Minister of State is aware, most disability policy flows from the old commission report on the status of people with disabilities, produced 15 years ago.  The commission identified the need for a national body to represent people with disabilities in that report.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State that the new strategy group she intends to establish will become such a national body to represent people with disabilities?</p>

            <p eId="para_1185">I will provide Deputy O'Brien with a complete breakdown of the allocation later on.  It was disproportionate.  I understand it was of the order of 60% or more in terms of the national headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">I met the board members of People with Disabilities in Ireland this afternoon to discuss how their voice can continue to be heard.  I intend that it will be heard nationally through the disability stakeholders group which is central to all of Government.  Other issue must be considered as well.  I see no reason that their voice cannot be heard through partnership or Leader programmes or through local authorities, in other words, where decisions are made and where people with disabilities can have a useful input.  We are considering such a structure.  I intend to invite more people with a particular view in respect of disability to join the disability stakeholders group at national level within the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>

The Minister of State suggested there is no reason they cannot continue in a volunteering capacity but this is simply not practical for all the groups.  Is there any possibility that these groups could apply for funding in other areas within the Department or through the HSE to enable them to continue to operate?  The Minister of State knows the work of some of these groups as well as I do.  They carry out great work and they should not be penalised for whatever took place at headquarters or at administrative level.</p>

We intend to consider some suitable form or structure either through partnership, Leader programmes, local authorities or the health forums.  Avenues of funding are always available.  The difficulty was that although the challenge was put up to PWDI earlier this year in terms of how it could give better value for money for the people it represents, this did not materialise and we must find another vehicle to make their voice heard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1191">A visiting committee is appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925.  There are currently 14 visiting committees, one for each institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and to hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.  They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they believe may be urgently required.  The visiting committee members have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">Details of visits, including announced and unannounced visits, along with the arrangements generally made by committees are for the most part contained in the prison visiting committee annual reports for 2010 which I published on 18 November 2011.  These reports along with reports from previous years are available on my Department's website.  In the case of St Patrick's Institution, the committee reported that they met monthly and carried out 48 random unannounced visits in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">I have previously stated my intention to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons.  Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make visiting committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisoners and prisons and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  The arrangements for membership of the committees will be changed and a link will be established between the visiting committees and the Inspector of Prisons in Ireland.  I believe this will provide for a more integrated approach generally and will enhance independent oversight of our prison system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1195">With regard to St. Patrick's Institution, I have the report before me and it makes for great reading.  However, let us consider some of the figures we have obtained since its publication.  In a recent report by the Inspector of Prisons in Ireland, it was noted that 25% of the juvenile population in St. Patrick's Institution asked to be held on detention for their own safety.  Given the number of complaints made in the recent prison report — I understand there were 19 in total — the figures do not appear to match up.  There appears to be few complaints but a high percentage of juvenile prisoners seek special protection within the institution.  What is the reason for this?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_463" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1196">The reason for that is nothing to do with the prison staff.  It is to do with young people being members of gangs and being afraid of other members of other gangs.  This is a problem within the prison estate dealing with those in their late teens and early 20s in the context of gangs engaged in criminality.  Some of these are engaged in violent criminality and the drugs trade where real rivalries exist.  Some entering prison make the request that they be treated in the manner as stated by the Deputy.  It is not as a result of a disciplinary problem that someone is placed in such a prison cell; it is because they fear for their safety upon admittance to the prison.  This is something which must be catered for and it is part and parcel of the difficulties that arise from young people engaged in serious criminality or in a rivalry that produces substantial violence.  Such violence translates itself from open society and communities to the prison system.  That is the primary reason for the difficulty the Deputy described.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">I again refer to complaints.  The report states 44 requests for complaint forms were made, yet only 19 were submitted.  That suggests for whatever reason people do not feel comfortable making complaints after receiving forms.  Is there any reason why the remit of the Ombudsman for Children cannot be extended to cover that?</p>

            <p eId="para_1198">In the context of young people under 18 who are still accommodated in St. Patrick's, as the Deputy knows it is Government policy to bring that to an end and that requires the building of the new facility in Oberstown in Lusk.  The planning for that will continue into 2012 and plans are being drawn up.  From 1 January it will fall into the remit of the Minister for Children, which is where it should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">As matters stand, at present St Patrick's Institution, because it is a prison primarily for adults over 18, does not fall within the general remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  Should a prisoner in that prison wish to consult the ombudsman or the ombudsman wish to visit the prison, I can assure the Deputy that facility will be made available and no obstacle will be put in the way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">I do not know why there are occasions when people request complaint forms and do not lodge complaints.  It may be on occasions they do not have a real complaint to make.  As I have drawn to the Deputy's attention, we are going to do everything possible to ensure that there is independent oversight.  The visiting committee, from reading its report relating to St Patrick's institution, was a very dedicated committee which engaged in its work very diligently and produced a report in which it set out its views.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">I want to move from a situation where what happens in practice is that visiting committees, although they can contact the Minister during the year, tend to produce annual reports.  I want direct communication between those appointed to prison visiting committees and the inspector of prisons.  During the course of a year if there is a particular issue and they want to draw it to the inspector's attention they can do so and we will formalise in law an arrangement between members of the visiting committees and the inspector of prisons.  That will produce better independent oversight and I hope we will be in a position to publish that legislation during the course of 2012.</p>

        <b> Deputy Dara Calleary</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
          his response to the view of the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, that the threat of dissident republican activity was severe; the steps he is taking to tackle this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [38011/11]

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_468" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1205">I know that all Members of the House will join me in condemning all subversive groups and their activities.  These groups may be called, as the Deputy refers to them, "dissident republicans", but such a label lends them an historical respectability they do not deserve.  We should be clear that these people are no more than criminal terrorists using violence in pursuit of their own, sometimes personal, ends and using violence, frequently, for their own personal benefit.  They have no support in the wider community, North and South, for either their criminal aims or for their violent methods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">Since early 2009 the threat level in Northern Ireland has been classified as severe.  In particular, these groups have targeted PSNI officers and staff, most recently with the brutal murder of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr in April of this year whose funeral I attended.  The threat faced on this island from these subversives is a shared threat and I can assure the House that the Garda continues to co-operate seamlessly with the PSNI in actively pursuing and targeting these groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Commissioner and the Chief Constable and their respective forces.  Both police chiefs have emphasised the close nature and the high quality of the ongoing co-operation between their forces and it has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.  The two police forces operate a cross-Border policing strategy, which covers areas including cross-Border investigations and operations, intelligence-sharing and security, ICT and emergency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">Combating the subversive threat has always been an absolute priority for the Garda authorities and it will remain so, even in the current climate of financial constraint.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is committed to maintaining that high level of co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI.  There is also close co-operation and regular contact between my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office.  By working together on matters of mutual concern and interest we can improve community safety for all the people on this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">I can advise the Deputy I met with the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, David Ford, twice last week and on both occasions we reviewed the various aspects of cross-Border co-operation between our Departments and related agencies, including the ongoing measures being taken to counteract subversive crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">I thank the Minister for his response.  I agree with the phrases he used.  The matter came up in the context of reports from the meeting of the Chief Constable and the Commissioner last Friday.  Are other agencies and Ministers involved in working with the Minister, such as the Revenue Commissioners or Customs?  Do they have the similar strength of relationship the two police forces clearly have with their equivalents in the Six Counties?  Do they have joint measures?  Fuel smuggling and, I suspect, social welfare fraud could be issues.  Is there a cross-governmental approach?  Is the strength of the relationship between the police forces on the island equal, if not stronger, to that of other agencies?</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_470" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1211">There is very substantial co-operation and there have been joint operations involving the PSNI and Garda and Her Majesty's Revenue Services and the Revenue Commissioners.  Those operations have been particularly successful in the context of dealing, not simply with subversion but with criminal gangs who have been engaged in fuel smuggling, drug trafficking and in bringing large amounts of tobacco products and cigarettes across the border into the Republic to evade revenue obligations that would otherwise arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">It would be fair to say that the Minister, David Ford, MLA, and myself agree that the level of co-operation is as good as it could be.  There is substantial interaction between agencies across the Border on both sides to ensure the maximum co-operation in tackling not just subversives but organised crime.  I would maintain regular contact with Minister Ford, as he does with me, on occasion by telephone without formal meetings, where issues arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">There is a close relationship between the Chief Constable Matt Baggott and the Garda Commissioner, and that will continue to be the case.  I had the pleasure, with Minister Ford, of opening a joint police conference which was held a few days ago between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána in which they looked overall at policy and where we now stand, and future policy development in the tackling of organised crime and subversive crime on all parts of the island.</p>

            <p eId="para_1214">In terms of future policy development, would the Minister consider a cross-Border version of the CAB?  He is putting a lot of work into establishing it on a European wide basis.  It strikes me that some of the individuals involved in crime need such attention.  Perhaps under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement we would be able to come up with some sort of body that would have CAB-style powers to go after these people in the only way that we can hit them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1215">As the Deputy may know there is already that type of co-operation between this State and the United Kingdom that has operated reasonably well and, in so far as we can put in place new measures in co-operation with Northern Ireland now that the area of justice has been devolved, we are continuing to explore those.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">I should say to the Deputy that in dealing with this area I also met last week with Hugo Swire, MLA, the Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office, who deals with matters in this area, and I have also maintained contact with the Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, MP.  There is an ongoing flow of information and interaction between officials on both sides of the Border.  A number of working groups have been established in the criminal justice area and joint working groups North and South are developing policies across a broad range of areas.</p>

        <b> Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
          the capital projects he will undertake in 2012.  
        [38037/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_473" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1218">Under the recently published Infrastructure and Capital Investment programme 2012-2016, the justice sector allocation for 2012 is €56 million.  This represents a 30% reduction on the current year's allocation of €80 million.  While detailed planning for 2012 is in the process of being finalised, it is important that this allocation is utilised in such a manner as to drive the maximum value possible and have the greatest impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Our key priority for 2012 is to address the issue of overcrowding and conditions in prisons.  The lion's share of the 2012 allocation, €24.1million, is therefore targeted at addressing these issues within the Prison Service and will result in several major projects being undertaken or completed during 2012.  Work will continue on the completion of a new wing in the Midlands Prison, which will result in an additional 300 spaces becoming available.  In addition, renovations will be undertaken on B wing in Mountjoy Prison with the result that by the end of the year, almost 60% of cells will have in-cell sanitation.  Other general infrastructural projects to be undertaken by the Prison Service in 2012 include the upgrading and enhancement of fire detection and CCTV systems and the development of key information technology systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">Within the Courts Service Vote, building renovation and upgrading projects will commence at Wexford, Waterford, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Dundalk.  There will be additional project work undertaken on information technology systems in order to facilitate the implementation of the Fines Act 2010, which will allow for fines to be paid by instalment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">In respect of the Justice Vote for 2012, I intend to continue with the development of a DNA database by the Forensic Science Laboratory.  I also intend to explore how best the completion of the building of the new laboratory and office accommodation for the Office of the State Pathologist, which is a partnership project with Dublin City Council, can be progressed having regard to the limited capital sum available.  The current works are suspended due to the original developer being placed in receivership and the project will need to be re-tendered in order to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">On the Garda Síochána and Property Registration Authority Votes, the focus is on the efficient and effective delivery of services.  In keeping with this aim, the majority of expenditure on these Votes will be on the development and maintenance of information technology and communications systems.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_474">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1223">The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality visited St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy Prison at the end of October.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the governor of Mountjoy, Mr. Edward Whelan, and his staff for the transformation they have overseen in recent years.  I am pleased this work will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">However, there is a missed opportunity in the postponement of the construction of Thornton Hall.  The Minister has indicated that the project may be considered in the future.  While several large-scale capital projects under the remit of the Department of Health, for example, have been given the go ahead, this flagship prison accommodation project did not escape the cull.  A great chance has thereby been lost to reform the prison system.  Is the project dead or does the Minister envisage it commencing in the next three to four years?  Is any review planned in this regard?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_475" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1225">I agree that the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. Whelan, has done an extraordinary job in a very short time.  He has transformed the facility and put in place effective measures to reduce the amount of drugs and mobile telephones getting into the prison.  He has made a very substantial difference and it is right that we acknowledge it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">The Thornton Hall project is not dead.  I greatly regret that having spent a very large sum of money, in excess of €30 million, on the acquisition of lands for the prison in 2006, the previous Government, when it was flaithiúlach with money, did not use some of it to progress the project.  It attempted to put in place a public private partnership but was not successful.  We now find ourselves in a position of very limited funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The Government has accepted in principle the recommendations of the Thornton Hall review group that a new prison should ultimately be built at that site.  I should also mention Kilworth Prison in Cork, about which I have substantial concerns in regard to its capacity.  That is not to take away from the governor of that facility, who is also doing an extraordinary job.  When we get to the autumn of next year and examine what capital is available in real terms to the Department for 2013, I hope we will have an opportunity at least to progress either the Kilworth or the Mountjoy project.  The fact that we are now able to provide in-cell sanitation at Mountjoy is relieving some of the pressures, something which was considered impossible a few years ago.  It may be that providing a facility to replace that at Kilworth will have a greater priority than addressing Thornton Hall.  However, on a policy level, we are committed to both projects.  Progress simply depends on whether the necessary funding is available.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_476">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1228">Most of us are still thinking about 2012, never mind 2013.  What the governor, Mr. Whelan, has done in Mountjoy shows what can be achieved with a modest expenditure, particularly in terms of simple measures relating to drugs and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The Minister mentioned in his reply that information technology upgrades will be necessary in order to implement the provisions of the Fines Act.  When we were discussing the Estimates this morning, moneys were reallocated from the Courts Service's information technology Vote to another area.  Given the need for the upgrade project to be done as quickly as possible, why is there an underspend in respect of the Courts Service's information technology allocation?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1230">I welcome the Minister's comment in regard to Kilworth Prison.  In regard to the construction of new Garda stations, I presume this comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have just had a debate on the proposed closure of some existing stations.  However, a planning application was recently submitted in respect of a new Garda station in Cork.  Where will the capital funding come from to progress that project?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_478" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1231">I understand the capital funding for Garda stations, fortunately, comes from the OPW.  If I am wrong in that I will notify the Deputy in writing of the correction.  It is my understanding that there are some plans within the OPW, in accordance with the limited financial envelope available to it, to progress the project to which the Deputy referred.  However, whether it will progress in 2012 or perhaps go through a planning change I do not know.  I will inquire into it further for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Regarding the information technology underspend to which Deputy Calleary referred, some of this can simply be due to timing.  We dealt largely with current expenditure today, including maintenance issues and so on, whereas the putting in place of new software systems for the implementation of the provisions of the Fines Act is a capital project.  Unfortunately, the Estimates produced by the previous Government in December 2010 did not include an allocation for funding for the new software.  We now have that funding for next year and I will ensure it is secured in order to allow us to develop the system.  That is why it is part of the programme to which I referred.</p>

            <p eId="para_1234">Under the Constitution, members of the Judiciary are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  Applications for judicial appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which was established pursuant to the Court and Courts Officers Act 1995.  The board consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, nominated representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the advisory board submits the names of all persons who have informed it of their wish to be considered for appointment to that vacancy and the names of at least seven persons whom it recommends for appointment.  Section 17 of the Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.  The Act further provides that the Government, when advising the President in regard to the appointment of a person to a judicial office, must first consider persons who have been recommended by the board.  It is important to note that the board can neither submit nor recommend the name of a person unless he or she meets the eligibility requirements currently set out in law in respect of the post in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">At an early stage following my appointment, I requested my officials to conduct an examination of the current judicial appointments procedure with particular reference to the practice in other jurisdictions.  This review is wide-ranging and includes consideration of the following issues: the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence; eligibility for appointment; composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board; the appointments process; accountability in respect of its functioning; and promoting equality and diversity.  I expect to be in a position to give further consideration to the matter when the review is completed in the first quarter of next year.  I will bring any proposals for change before the Government in the usual manner.  The Act further provides for the Government, when advising the President on the appointment of a person to a judicial office, must first consider persons who have been recommended by the board.  It is important to note that the board can neither submit nor recommend the name of a person unless that person meets the eligibility requirements currently set out in law for the post in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1237">I preface my remarks by saying that we are very fortunate in our Judiciary whose members are independent minded and independent in spirit.  As I said on Tuesday evening when speaking on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill, the Judiciary provides the checks and balances which both this House and any Government needs.  However, there is undoubtedly a perception that one needs to have political connections to be appointed to the Bench.  This is the perception, whether true or not.  The appointments made by this Government and by Governments in which my party participated, have always emphasised this perception and the most recent appointments reinforce it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">Dearbhail McDonald, a fine journalist with the <i>Irish Independent</i>, produced research recently which showed there had been 6,000 applications for judicial appointments — an extraordinary figure — and yet, those selected in the most recent round were people with political connections.  The Minister’s review is urgently required as some form of checks and balances is required in the system so those applicants without political connections would be confident of having as equal a chance as anybody else to serve on the Bench.  There is a danger that the longer we leave the system as it is, that confidence will not be there.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_481" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1239">It is unfortunate that there should be a perception in any circumstances that any form of political connection is required in order to be appointed to the Judiciary.  In the case of every appointment made by this Government, the persons were appointed because of their legal expertise, their reputation as lawyers and in all but two of the appointments made, were appointments made on foot of a recommendation from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The two appointments made that were not on foot of a recommendation from the board included the appointment of the Chief Justice, Susan Denham, who was an Ordinary Judge of the Supreme Court.  The appointment of a Chief Justice is an appointment made by the Government and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no role in this appointment.  The other appointment was the promotion of Judge Thomas O'Donnell, a District Court Judge, to the Circuit Court.  This was the promotion of a judge, as has happened in many instances and in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board plays no role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">What is particularly unfortunate is the presentation being made in the media to suggest that those who have ever engaged in political activity or those who have ever contributed to a political party, should first be ineligible to be appointed to the Judiciary and in my view it is also unfortunate that individuals who seek such appointment, who are recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and who are appointed because of their expertise, now find themselves with regularity pilloried by some sections of the media as being unworthy of the appointments.  It is very important that this House does not add to that perception.  It is important to send out the message that such appointments will be made based on expertise.  There is a very dangerous road now being travelled.  This is a democracy and we have an interest in encouraging people of ability to engage in the democratic process, to engage in politics, to support one or other political party or to be independent in their political views.  It would be most unfortunate if we created a system whereby because someone had been politically engaged, he or she was deemed ineligible and, indeed, would fear that if they seek judicial appointment, they will suffer the type of pillorying that has been experienced recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">Although I think some sections of the media would not believe this, following some of the appointments made by this Government which were based on merit and recommendation from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, I have opened my newspaper the following morning to read some allegation that someone has contributed to a candidate's election campaign or someone was engaged in politics in years gone by or has an aunt or an uncle, cousin or someone associated with a political party and the perception is presented that this is the reason he or she was appointed.  On occasions, I have not known of any particular political commitments, engagements or relations.  In the case of one of the recent appointments we seem to have arrived at the point where because someone was the sister-in-law of a TD, it was suggested an appointment had been made when in fact that individual was appointed because of the person's excellence and because the person was one of the names recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1248">I can advise the Deputy it is not factually correct that work undertaken by prisoners in Irish prisons is unpaid.  All prisoners are eligible for a daily gratuity whether or not they carry out prison work, which is not the case in many other countries, and prisoners in most prisons may earn additional gratuities by carrying out certain types of work.  The current rate of the daily gratuity is €2.35.  The additional gratuity for prison work is typically paid in the form of vouchers which can be used to purchase goods in the prison tuck shop.  The levels of additional gratuity are set by the governor in each institution.  The current rate averages approximately €10 per week.  I should point out also that most forms of work in Irish prisons offer an opportunity to avail of accredited training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">A review of the gratuity payments and allowances system has recently been completed by the Irish Prison Service.  I am currently considering the recommendations arising from this review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1252">Is it proposed to change that practice?  I refer to the Irish Prison Service recommendation.  For example, I am not paid in vouchers for my work as a TD and I am sure the Minister is not paid in vouchers for his work.  I do not think it is fair to say that prisoners are being paid when they are given vouchers to spend in the tuck shop or whatever.  I would not regard this as the same as being paid for work undertaken.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_490" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1253">The moneys which prisoners receive go into a fund and it is available for them to use in prison if they wish by way of the tuck shop or other expenditure.  It is also open to them to have it transmitted to family members if they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">People are in prison for a particular reason.  It is a privilege that in return for work done they receive some small additional benefit, if I could put it that way.  Certainly, the State is not in a position — I do not believe there would be any public support of any nature — for large sums of money to be paid to persons convicted of offences and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  It is extremely costly to the taxpayer to keep prisoners in prison and in that context, some people would be of the view that prisoners should contribute to that cost by work they carry out in prison.  What prisoners receive is a nominal gratuity on a daily basis which ensures that prisoners can avail of certain benefits or purchase certain items in the tuck shop which may not otherwise be available to them and which, in particular, impecunious prisoners would not be able to afford otherwise.  Arrangements can be made and are made on occasions for family members to furnish funds to prisoners to assist them in that regard.  There is no question of any nature whatever of this State putting in place, during the lifetime of this Government, any substantial payments to prisoners in return for work done.  These are extra gratuities to allow prisoners to avail of certain basic items in prison that are additional to the food provided or to purchase cigarettes or whatever.  There is no question of going beyond that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1255">No one is suggesting we pay prisoners large sums for work they do in the prison system.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that is not what I meant.  Will consideration be given to moving from giving vouchers to those who engage in work in prison to giving them the value of the vouchers?  As the Minister noted, some prisoners send money to family members outside the prison system.  No one is suggesting prisoners be paid the same wage as employees outside the prison system.  I simply ask that consideration be given to giving prisoners the monetary value of the vouchers.</p>

However, I do not envisage major changes and certainly not any changes that will result in any additional expense to taxpayers at a time when the funding available to the Government is extremely limited.</p>

            <p eId="para_1260">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 29 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The reply covers some of the ground we covered in an earlier question.  As the Deputy may be aware, responsibility for the children detention schools under Part 10 of the Children Act 2001 will shortly transfer to my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Accordingly, both I and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs participated in a number of discussions at Cabinet level and bilaterally with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the capital expenditure proposals for our respective areas, including the proposed national children detention facility at Oberstown, in advance of the recent announcement of the Government's capital investment framework for the period 2012 to 2016.  Ongoing contact also takes place at senior official level between our Departments on financial and budgetary matters, including the funding requirements for capital expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">It was not, unfortunately, possible to include the Oberstown project in the recent list of projects covered by the Government capital investment framework.  However, the Government remains committed to ending the use of St. Patrick's Institution for the detention of 16 and 17 year old males.  To this end, the Irish Youth Justice Service has been tasked with progressing to completion during 2012 the design work and tender documentation for the Oberstown project.  An assessment is being carried out of what financial and technical resources would be needed during 2012 to carry out this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I are in consultations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the funding of the subsequent construction stage of the project.  I do not propose to comment further on these consultations, except to say the Deputy can be assured that both the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I will continue to make the case at Government level on the priority that should be given to the Oberstown project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1268">I wish to advise the Deputy that an administrative building on the Dóchas Centre site has been converted into a new accommodation block which will provide an additional 70 spaces.  It is expected that this block will be ready for occupation in early 2012.  The opening of the new spaces at the Dóchas Centre will assist in alleviating the overcrowding issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The ethos upon which the Dóchas Centre was built was that the women prisoners should live together in a community style setting.   Women prisoners serving short sentences can be housed in the same areas as women serving longer sentences.  The Governor of the Dóchas Centre has the responsibility to determine who resides where within the female prison.  This responsibility will remain with prison management when the dormitory style accommodation becomes available.  However it is likely that the new accommodation will be used in particular for remand and short term prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">The Irish Prison Service has informed me that there has been a significant reduction in the supply of contraband into the Dóchas Centre since netting was installed over the prison yards earlier this year.  Other initiatives introduced in the Dóchas Centre, as well as the male prisons, have significantly reduced the availability of contraband in prisons, including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">tighter control and monitoring of prison visits;</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">airport style security screening of all staff and visitors coming into the prison;</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">stricter searching of those committed to custody and of those returning to the prison after temporary release, court and after visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">I am satisfied that significant progress is being made in order to reduce the flow of contraband into the prisons.  I do not foresee a difficulty with continuing this good work whatever the style of accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1279">The prevalence of mental illness is significantly higher among prisoners compared to the general population and the mental health problems suffered by prisoners range from mild to severe.  There is a strong argument that persons with severe mental illnesses who are involved in minor offences should be diverted away from the criminal justice system and measures have been undertaken to progress such an approach.  However if a serious crime such as a homicide is involved, the issue has to be addressed by the criminal justice system.  Furthermore, we also have prisoners properly convicted and imprisoned for serious offences who may develop mental illness after their imprisonment.  Depending on the nature and severity of that illness the question has to be determined, as with any illness, whether it can be appropriately treated in a prison environment or whether a transfer to a designated centre is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">A study undertaken in 2003 by the National Forensic Mental Health Service found that there is an excess of those with severe mental illness in all parts of the Irish prison population.  The report estimated that 3.7% of male committals, 7.5% of males on remand, 2.7% of sentenced males and 5.4% of female prisoners should be diverted to psychiatric services, while as many as 20% of male committals and 32% of female committals needed to be seen by a psychiatrist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">In 2006 the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy published its report "Vision for Change". That report recognised the pivotal role of primary care in addressing the mental health needs of the population and noted that it is widely recognised that 90% of mental health problems can be dealt with in primary care without referral to a specialist mental health service. In each prison primary care is the model of care through which health care is delivered; it is the linchpin of the prison health care system and where a prisoner experiences a mental health issue the prison doctor is usually the first point of contact.  The Central Mental Hospital National Forensic Mental Health Service provides 20 consultant led in-reach sessions weekly by arrangement at all Dublin prisons and also at Portlaoise and the Midlands Prisons. Specialist in-reach services are in place for consultant led mental health sessions in the remaining prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">The World Health Organisation has awarded a "Health in Prisons Best Practice Award 2011" to the recently opened High Support Unit in Mountjoy Prison.  The High Support Unit is a 9 bed facility opened in the Medical Unit of Mountjoy Prison in December 2010.  It provides expert, supportive, short term input for prisoners who are in an acutely disturbed phase of a mental illness or require increased observation for a physical ailment, which has attendant increased risks.  It provides a more controlled and supportive environment for a vulnerable prisoner as a short term intervention. The Irish Prison Service are exploring the possibility of expanding on this initiative by opening similar Units in other prison institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">There are prisoners who should more properly be treated in some form of therapeutic environment.  The Criminal Law (Insanity) Acts 2006 and  2010 provides for the transfer of prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">The existing arrangements do give rise to problems. An interdepartmental group has being designated to examine the issue of people with mental illness coming into the criminal justice system and this is in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Review Group which were approved by Government last July. My officials are consulting with the Department of Health on the arrangements involved including the terms of reference and an announcement will be made shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1286">The National Women's Strategy 2007-2016 was published by the previous Government in 2007.  The aims of the strategy are largely in line with the policies of the present Government.  Its actions are being implemented by a wide range of Government Departments and Agencies.  It goes without saying that the constraints of the public financial situation apply to some extent.  This is a ten-year strategy containing 20 objectives and over 200 actions.  Its full implementation cannot be expected after just four years.  I was happy to note that considerable progress is being made in the implementation of the strategy and an annual report  is published on my Department's website.  To highlight some of the key achievements, women's employment has been less adversely affected to date in the recession and the gender pay gap has narrowed further.  Significant advances have been made in relation to cancer screening services for women.  In my own Department, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, and the Anti Human Trafficking Unit have been set up.  The Minister of State is actively leading work on women in politics and other decision making roles.  Among the issues which will need further development are a couple of complex social welfare issues; enhanced caring; a number of health and well-being actions such as the mental health of women in the perinatal period and also the issue of bullying.  My Department is undertaking a review of the strategy.  This will explore the changed environment, achievements to date, steps to implement outstanding issues and may make recommendations for amendments which the Government will consider.</p>

Work in relation to relevant domestic and sexual violence training programmes for the justice sector, including An Garda Síochána, is being progressed by a committee led by Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, an executive office within my Department.  The committee expects to finalise its report shortly.  During their initial training, all members of An Garda Síochána receive instructions in the handling and investigation of incidents relating to domestic violence.  This training includes procedures to be followed when recording reports of domestic violence, first aid training, diversity training and training on safety and barring orders.  Additional training is given in the Garda College through a number of outside agencies which include Focus Point, the Rape Crisis Centre, Women's Aid, MOVE and AMEN.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The Garda Síochána Policy on Domestic Violence Intervention has been reviewed in recent years.  Revised instructions were issued in 2007 which outlined procedures to be adopted in investigating such incidents.  The recently amended Children First — National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children (2011) has also been adopted as Garda policy.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, under Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, has national responsibility for the monitoring and implementation of Garda Policy on Domestic Violence within the State.  Members of this unit are available to provide expert assistance to District and Divisional officers and there are monitoring mechanisms in place, with a Garda Inspector appointed in every Garda Division, to ensure uniform enforcement countrywide.  Members of An Garda Síochána have also attended at international training courses and seminars relative to issues of domestic violence and sexual abuse, with up-to-date information, legislation, guidance and best practice available to all members of An Garda Síochána, through internal mechanisms, to assist in the investigation of such incidents.</p>

            <p eId="para_1291">A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by people on bail.  I share that concern.  I believe the bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by people on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update the bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  The proposed legislation is being drawn up to operate within the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights.  It will also have a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.  I will bring proposals to the Government on the matter shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1293">The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service.  The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of people involving the State.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The Deputy will appreciate that the inquest is the main means by which the State fulfils its obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to investigate objectively and publicly any death that involves State authorities.  At present, all deaths in prison custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held by a coroner.  The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the coroner.  The circumstances of each death in prison custody are also examined by a multi-disciplinary group in each institution.  The objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.  The Prison Rules 2007 are also being amended to reflect the recommendations of Inspector of Prisons in his report "Guidance on Best Practice relating to the Investigation of Deaths in Prison Custody".  The effect of the amendment proposed will provide for an investigation which will be robust, independent and transparent.  Investigations will be conducted by independent persons who will undertake an investigation into all deaths in prison.  In the interim, the Irish Prison Service has, on an administrative basis, put in place an independent process for the investigation of deaths in prison in advance of the matter being placed on a statutory footing.  This independent investigative system has been in place since March 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">Deaths in Garda custody, widely defined, are also the subject of distinct independent investigations.  A death in Garda custody is defined as a death which takes place in the period after a person comes into the custody and control of a member of the Garda Síochána and before they leave Garda custody and control.  It includes, for example, not only a death at the time of arrest, or in a Garda station, but the death of a person in hospital for treatment while still in Garda custody.  Such deaths are the subject of an inquest but, in addition, under section 102(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is required to refer to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission any matter that appears to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána may have resulted in the death of or serious harm to a person, and the Ombudsman Commission must immediately conduct its own independent investigation into the matter.  As matters stand under the Human Rights Act 2003, our courts are required to interpret Irish legislation in so far as possible in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the European Convention provisions.  It means that coroner law is enabled to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Convention law and jurisprudence.  It is my intention to progress the Coroners Bill as soon as possible in the New Year.</p>

        [38019/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_503">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1297">I wish to advise the Deputy that legal aid in Ireland falls under two separate categories, i.e. civil legal aid and criminal legal aid and I will deal with these separately as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">Civil legal aid in Ireland is delivered by the Legal Aid Board, which is a statutory independent body. Legal services are delivered through the Board's 29 law centres and a small number of specialist units. The service is complemented through the use of private practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">In the last four years there has been a considerable increase in demand to the Board for legal services and this coincides with the downturn in the economy. In 2007 10,164 persons sought legal services from the Board in relation to general civil (non asylum) matters. This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010 and is likely to be greater again this year. Inevitably, this has created huge pressures for the Board and its capacity to deliver legal services within a reasonable period of time. As of the 1 November 2011, there were just under 4,800 persons waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor. This compares to 1,681 on the 1 January 2009. It is worth pointing out, though, that certain types of priority cases, domestic violence for example, receive  an immediate or near immediate service and these account for about 15% of all legal aid cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The challenge for the Board in 2012 will be to continue to provide services in view of the significant increase in demand coupled with the fact that increasing the funding for the service is not currently a viable option. The Board's grant-in-aid, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has fallen from almost €27 million in 2008 to just over €24 million this year. Funding allocations for the Board for 2012 will of course be announced next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The Legal Aid Board has already taken a number of steps in order to try to optimise the service in view of the pressures it is under. I am aware that the Board's Chief Executive has been working on options to further respond to the situation in respect of the demand for the service. One approach which will be considered is a pilot ‘triage' service early in 2012. The objective of the triage service will be to ensure that every applicant for services gets to see a solicitor for the purpose of getting early legal advice within a short period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">The House will be aware that since the 1 November the Board has assumed responsibility for the Family Mediation Service. I took the decision to integrate the Family Mediation Service into the Board because it is my view that mediation in many family law cases offers a better route and outcome for the parties than the adversarial environment of the courts. I am informed that the Board is currently reviewing the operation of the State funded mediation service with a view to achieving synergies with its legal services and better options in terms of resolving family disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">The Board keeps under review the arrangements on which it retains professionals (primarily solicitors and barristers). The arrangements of foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review. There will be a level of restructuring of the current arrangements which will involve a reduction in the fees payable in most case types. The Board considers that the proposed revised arrangements will not significantly impact on the availability of barristers to take cases. It is not anticipated that there will be a significant reduction in the overall amount the Board pays to barristers — what is anticipated is that there will be more cases done for the same amount of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">As the Deputy will be aware, the nature of Criminal Legal Aid is that it is demand led and is driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and prosecution of cases through the courts system. It is therefore, difficult to control costs but in the current circumstances it is essential to do everything possible to control and reduce expenditure across all areas of the criminal justice system, including criminal legal aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">A range of cost reduction measures were implemented this year including a 10% reduction in the fees and rates payable to legal practitioners under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. As these reductions were introduced in the third and fourth quarters of this year, their full impact on expenditure will not be apparent until 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">I am aware of the impact on the legal profession of these reductions and have been concerned to ensure that legal representation can continue to be provided to those who need it. As with other sectors of the economy, the cumulative effect of reductions in fee rates paid has been a source of deep concern amongst practitioners about the level of cuts and the financial implications for firms and their employees. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, at this point there is no area of our society that is not feeling the effects of reduced incomes and the difficult economic climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">I am not prepared to give an absolute commitment that there will be no reduction in the rates of fees paid under the scheme in 2012. This would be irresponsible given that I cannot know with certainty how economic matters will progress in the very volatile climate in which we find ourselves. However, what I can say is that every effort is being made to avoid that possibility. In that regard, the Task Force which I established to identify any structural changes necessary within the Courts system to achieve cost reductions in the medium to longer term, has identified a number of measures which have the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, not just on criminal legal aid, but for other parts of the Justice sector such as An Garda Síochána and the Irish Prison Service. I have instructed my officials to move to implement these initiatives, where possible, by end 2012 and to ensure that any measures that require, for example, legislative change are prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">I am fully committed, as are my colleagues, to delivering savings and meeting the public expenditure targets for 2012 which will become known after the Budget to be announced next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The Deputy should also be aware that in addition to the cost reduction measures, I intend to publish in 2012 a new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Amendment Bill which will, amongst other measures, include a provision to transfer responsibility for the management and administration of criminal legal aid from the Department to the Legal Aid Board<b>.</b>

            <p eId="para_1311">The reports highlighted a number of issues across the prison system but there was also an acknowledgement of the efforts made by the Irish Prison Service to address the issues despite limited resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">As I outlined in the House last week, several issues have been addressed.  These include, for example, increased Library access in the Dóchas Centre; consideration to increasing the number of dedicated phone lines and call queuing to make it easier to pre-book visits in the Midlands Prison; efforts to reduce the number of prisoners on 23 hour lock up in Mountjoy Prison and more structured access to the Library there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">I fully accept that further improvements are needed.  This Government remains committed to tackling overcrowding, poor physical conditions in our prisons, and to eliminate where possible the problem of slopping out.   An extensive project to upgrade and provide in-cell sanitation to more than 100 cells in Mountjoy Prison will be completed shortly.  The Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, recently wrote to me congratulating my Department and the Irish Prison Service on the work carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">A similar renovation of B Division will result in 317 cells in Mountjoy Prison having in-cell sanitation by the end of next year, almost 60% of the total prison.  The completion of the Midlands Prison extension and the provision of 70 extra dormitory style spaces in the Dóchas Centre will mean that approximately 80% of the prisons estate will have in-cell sanitation by mid 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">The World Health Organisation has awarded a "Health in Prisons Best Practice Award 2011" to the recently opened High Support Unit in Mountjoy Prison; and to the Red Cross Project which has been rolled out in Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Shelton Abbey and Mountjoy Prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">As regards the specific issues highlighted in the Dóchas Centre in 2010, I am informed that procedures are now in place which respect the dignity of the prisoner and ensure that searches are conducted in a professional manner by the staff involved and I expect those procedures to be fully complied with.  A working group has also been established to oversee the implementation of guidelines on prisoner releases to ensure such a situation as that reported by the Committee does not arise in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">Finally, I announced plans some time ago to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons. Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.</p>

            <p eId="para_1335">In the context of the fiscal difficulties being experienced in the economy and in keeping with the budgetary cutbacks which are consequently necessary, it is regrettably necessary to reduce the level of support which my Department is in a position to provide to Community Alert in 2011.  Funding totalling €137,000 has been provided to Community Alert in 2011.

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1363">I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 37 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">In the Programme for National Recovery 2011-16, the Government has undertaken to "establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints". The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, published on 12 October, provides the statutory framework for delivering these commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">By the same token, the Bill supports the urgent objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery contained in the EU-IMF-ECB Memorandum of Understanding, while taking account of relevant recommendations made by the Legal Costs Working Group in 2005 and by the Competition Authority in 2006.  The intervening and unprecedented developments which necessitated the EU-IMF-ECB Memorandum continue to shape the Government's determination of appropriate policy responses, including in relation to legal services and legal costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">On 17th October, I briefed the EU-IMF-ECB Troika on the provisions of the new Legal Services Regulation Bill. The Troika considered the Bill to have met both the spirit and the letter of the Government's relevant undertakings.  I am confident that the new Legal Services Regulation Bill will contribute to better regulation and competitiveness in the provision of legal services in the State. There will be greater transparency and accountability in relation to legal costs for the benefit of all concerned. Officials of my Department have recently met with the Competition Authority which has been welcoming of the Bill and its key provisions — including that of establishing an independent regulator. Under the Bill -</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">there will be a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers with a lay majority in its membership and a lay chair; the Bill contains a number of provisions to ensure that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the legal professions are free from government interference or control in the discharge of their functions</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">there will be an independent complaints mechanism within the new regulatory authority to deal with allegations of professional misconduct against solicitors and barristers. This will be supported by a new independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal which will be independent of the Regulatory Authority and of the professional bodies</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing- Master. The new Office will have enhanced transparency in its functions and publish its determinations. The legal costs regime will be brought into the open with supporting guidelines and greater public entitlement to legal costs information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">The Second Stage debate on the Bill is expected to commence in the coming weeks and I will be outlining my intentions in relation to Committee Stage amendments at the appropriate time. I am, of course, open to further discussion on ways in which we might strengthen aspects of the Bill. I believe that, with the constructive engagement of all concerned, the Bill provides a framework within which we can  achieve an appropriate balance of the principles of professional independence and of independent regulation and make them mutually reinforcing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">While a preliminary regulatory impact assessment had been in preparation it did not prove possible to complete it for publication at the same time as the Bill due to the exceptionally demanding EU/IMF deadline that applied. However, I am happy to say that work on a regulatory impact assessment for the Bill is near completion and that it will be made available in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1376">I can inform the Deputy that the Group is reviewing a number of matters including decreasing the amount of time which must elapse before criminal assets which have been frozen become the property of the State;  increasing the powers of receivers over properties so as to immediately deprive criminals of the use of those properties; short term seizure of assets believed to be the proceeds of crime pending determination by the courts and further improving measures supporting international cooperation.</p>

In this regard, a six month pilot project commenced in October 2011 in which it is envisaged that a total of 130 prisoners will participate.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that 39 prisoners have been released under the scheme to date with 5 more due for release this week, and a further 13 the following week.

            <p eId="para_1403">Certain courses offered by the Higher Education Institutions through the Central Applications Office (CAO) require students to undertake placements that bring them into contact with children or vulnerable adults.  Before a student can undertake such a placement, he or she must be vetted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  This is a standard requirement that applies to all employment involving children and vulnerable adults and one that I will be putting on a statutory footing in the Vetting Bill.  Details of the courses that are subject to vetting and disclosure requirements are set out on the CAO website <i>www.cao.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">As the Deputy will be aware, section 258 of the Children Act 2001 provides for the non-disclosure of convictions acquired by persons while under the age of 18, subject to certain conditions, including that the person has not been convicted of another offence during the 3 years following his or her conviction.  This non-disclosure provision applies to all offences other than those that fall to be tried by the Central Criminal Court (e.g. murder).</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">My Department is currently completing the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill which I expect to publish in the New Year.  The Bill will provide for the non-disclosure of certain convictions after a number of years has elapsed, where a person is seeking employment.  However, anyone wishing to work with children or vulnerable adults will still be required to disclose all prior convictions, and the Gardaí will be permitted to disclose all convictions in these cases.  It will be for an employer to decide if those convictions are such as to call into question the suitability of the person to work with children or vulnerable adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Finally, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill is intended to assist the reintegration of offenders by smoothing their path to employment.  I would expect that responsible employers, including those providing placements to students on the courses referred to by the Deputy, would only take into account those convictions that are relevant to the employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1444">The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.  Programmes provided include health care, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These interventions are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody. These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">Following a recommendation by the Inspector Of Prisons in his 2010 Annual Report, an independent education audit has been commissioned by the Irish prison Service on the adequacy, efficiency and relevance of the prison education system.  The Psychology Service offers group and individual interventions to all prisoners. A particular emphasis has been put on the development of programmes for prisoners convicted of sex offences and violent offences. Significant progress is also being made in the development of programmes based on risk assessment and rehabilitation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The Irish Prison Service will continue to seek to improve the services available to prisoners insofar as resources allow. In this regard, a number of projects are currently underway which will improve the facilities available. A significant programme of works is nearing completion in the Dóchas Centre where, in addition to improving the overall standard of the Centre, it will provide for additional training workshops and a new training kitchen. At the Midlands prison, as part of the new accommodation block, additional work training and educational facilities are being provided. It is planned to have the block fully commissioned by mid 2012. It will also include a new fully fitted kitchen which will provide enhanced training opportunities for prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1448">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has independently assessed the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 14 September 2011, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in early 2012. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</p>

Preliminary findings from the work done to-date indicate that the percentage of offenders who did not commit an offence in the 12 and 24 month periods after their initial conviction is high.  However, this is a complex area of study and this research needs to be validated further before exact figures and findings can be published.</p>

            <p eId="para_1460">It is the case that, as with every other public sector organisation, the Garda Síochána is going to have to manage with reduced resources and I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána on 31 October 2011, on the latest date for which figures are readily available was 14,099.  Responsibility for the allocation of resources, including personnel, within the Force rests with the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team. Resource levels are constantly monitored, in conjunction with crime trends and the situation is kept under continuing review to ensure optimum use is made of all resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">An Garda Síochána pro-actively targets groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities. To this end, An Garda Síochána is committed to the use of intelligence-led operations and tactics, including those of specialist national units. As a result of these operations a number of individuals (including members of criminal groups) are before the Courts charged with serious offences. The monitoring of such groups is ongoing and kept under constant review.  Members of An Garda Síochána continue to utilise all available legislation, including the additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 which amended the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 relating to organised crime.  Multi-disciplinary approaches, such as the Criminal Assets Bureau, are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">I have made clear in answer to previous questions my deep concern about the residents of Camp Ashraf in Iraq, in light of the serious violence which took place in the camp last April and the Iraqi Government's clear insistence that it wishes the camp to be closed by the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Ireland and its EU partners are determined to seek a long-term and peaceful solution to the predicament of the residents of Camp Ashraf and EU Foreign Ministers are scheduled to discuss the question of Camp Ashraf at today's Foreign Affairs Council. I welcome the fact that the High Representative has appointed a Special Envoy, Ambassador Jean de Ruyt of Belgium, to work with the Iraqi authorities, the camp residents and other concerned international actors, including the UN and US, to achieve a peaceful resolution of this situation fully in line with international humanitarian and human rights principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">A process to manage the closure of the camp, led by the UN, is now getting underway. The UNHCR is undertaking this process to register and determine the status of those in the camp, including whether residents hold nationality of third countries. I fully support the efforts of UN envoy Martin Kobler to mediate between the government of Iraq and Camp Ashraf residents, and urge the Iraqi authorities to extend the deadline for the closure of Camp Ashraf to provide sufficient time to enable the UNHCR to explore resettlement options for camp residents that do not wish to return to Iran and do not have another nationality. It is also imperative that there should be no attempt at forced repatriation of any of those camp residents who do not wish to return to Iran.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Ireland fully recognises Iraqi sovereignty over the whole of its territory, including Camp Ashraf, but this sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities. The Iraqi Government has primary responsibility for the protection of all persons resident on its territory, including Camp Ashraf residents.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, strongly condemned the violence which took place in Camp Ashraf last April and I call on the Iraqi government to refrain from the use of violence and to show full respect for the human rights of Camp Ashraf's residents in the period ahead while the UNHCR explores resettlement options.</p>

            <p eId="para_1475">The Passports Act, 2008 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied as to the identity of each applicant for before a passport is issued to him/her.  Proofs of identity are required in respect of all passport applications.  These requirements, which are outlined both in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form and on the Department’s website <i>www.passport.ie</i>, enhance existing procedures to combat passport and identity fraud.  They are also intended to increase public awareness of the importance of a passport in terms of a person’s identity and the need to ensure that people take great care in protecting their passports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">In January this year, a series of changes to passport application procedures for first time adult applicants and those reporting passports lost or stolen was introduced.  The changes, which were introduced to combat passport fraud and identity theft, required that applicants in these categories submit additional documentary evidence to establish identity and entitlement to an Irish passport.  Particularly in the light of recent high profile international incidents relating to passport fraud, the measures were introduced to protect the integrity and international reputation of the Irish passport.  Among the requirements for first-time applicants or for those persons, whose passports have been lost or stolen, is the need to provide an additional form of photo-identification such as a copy of driver's licence, work ID, student card, social club membership or a passport from another country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">In those exceptional cases where an applicant is unable provide any general photographic ID, the Passport Service will require that the applicant complete and have witnessed a certificate of identity.  The certificate includes pre-printed details, including the application photograph, and must be witnessed by one from a list of persons, who are acceptable to the Passport Service for this purpose, and who also personally know the applicant.  The certificate of identity will be sent to the applicant upon receipt of the original passport application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1483">There is no scheme in place to assist mortgage holders who are in negative equity but who can meet their repayments and do not wish to move house.  Trade down mortgages were recommended in the recently published report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group in appropriate circumstances. In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages are consistent with the Central Bank's consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, a maximum loan to value ratio and other parameters would need to be agreed between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The Central Bank has advised me that they wrote to all mortgage lenders to ascertain whether they were offering, or intended to offer, a mortgage product that would allow home owners to sell their existing home and transfer the negative equity portion of the original loan to the new loan. In response to the Central Bank's letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility. A trial period commenced in mid-2011 and was due to be assessed by the Central Bank and the institutions involved before the end of the year. However the low level of activity makes it difficult to conduct a meaningful review at this time and the proposed review will not take place until the first half of 2012. Any institution offering such a facility may only do so in accordance with criteria agreed in advance with the Central Bank and subject to a trial period.  The Central Bank is concerned as to whether such products are in the long term interest of consumers as it could lead to indebtedness at a time when there is no certainty over the direction of future property values.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1536">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a number of studies have been undertaken in the last few years to determine the level of cross-Border shopping and how much this affects Exchequer revenue.  The Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, was published in March 2009.  This was followed on 4 December 2009 by the results of a survey of cross-Border shopping as part of the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) conducted in Quarter 2, 2009.  On 12 November 2010, the results of the QNHS cross-Border shopping survey for the year to Quarter 2, 2010 were released.  The report undertaken by Revenue and the CSO estimates the value of cross-Border shopping in 2008 in the range of €350m to €550m and the potential loss in VAT and excise revenues at between €58m and €90m (for reference, the higher estimate represents 0.4% of the total VAT and 0.6% of excise revenue in 2008).  In addition to the VAT and excise loss, there is a possible corporation tax revenue loss that is tentatively estimated to be in the range of €15m to €24m.  However, it should be noted that all estimates for corporation tax revenue should only be considered as indicative of the potential loss given the difficulties in calculating a figure for the direct impact of cross-Border shopping on such activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">Total household expenditure on cross border shopping in Northern Ireland between Quarter 2 2008 and Quarter 2 2009 is estimated at €435 million.  The combined VAT and excise revenue loss is estimated at €63m and a possible corporation tax revenue loss in the range of €19m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The results of the report for Q2 2010 indicate that 14% of households in the Republic made a shopping trip to Northern Ireland in the twelve months to Q2 2010, compared to 16% in the previous year.  While there was an increase in cross-Border shopping in the Border area from 41% to 43% over the year; there was a marked decrease in shopping activity by people from Dublin, where 15% made a shopping trip in 2010, compared with 21% in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The QNHS also showed that the majority of trips involved purchases of groceries, alcohol, clothing and durables, similar to the previous year.  The report estimated that the total expenditure in the year to Q2 2010 on cross-Border shopping trips at €418 million, reduced slightly from €435 million in the previous year.  Based on the data contained in the survey, Revenue has estimated that the VAT, Excise and Corporation Tax losses in this period due to cross-Border shopping was in the region of €80 million, a similar level to the €81 million the previous year and suggesting that the level of cross-Border shopping had stabilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">The statistics in the QNHS Reports were broadly in line with the results of the March 2009 Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic were operating costs, profit margin (mark-up), taxes and a significant depreciation of Sterling against the Euro.  While variations in the VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">In the 2010 Budget excise duty on alcohol was reduced by around 20%.  In addition, with the increase in the UK standard VAT rate from 15% to 17.5% in 2010 and to 20% on 4 January 2011, there is currently only one percentage point difference between the standard VAT rate in Ireland and the UK, having reduced from 6.5 percentage points in 2009.  With the proposed increase in the Irish standard VAT rate to 23% that differential will increase to 3 percentage points.  However, it must be pointed out that for most of the last two decades there was a differential of 3.5 percentage points between the VAT rates of both jurisdictions (with Ireland at 21% and the UK at 17.5%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">However, as the CSO and Revenue studies indicates, fluctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro represent the most significant influence in relation to cross-Border prices.  In this respect, the current exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State, despite proposed increase in the Irish VAT rate.</p>

The legislative basis for Green Public Procurement is established in EU Directives 17 and 18 of 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">Green Public Procurement is defined in EU Communication 400 of 2008 as "Public Procurement for a better Environment".  It is defined as <i>“a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with reduced environmental impact throughout their life-cycle compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured.”</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1601">The Guidance Document will include cement, as the manufacture of this material has one of the most significant environmental impacts of all construction materials.  The document recommends the use of alternative cements as a means of reducing this environmental impact.  The Guidance Document is produced in reference to the National Concrete Standard IS EN 206, which makes provision for the use of several different alternative cements, including limestone, pulverised fly ash (PVA), slag and pozzelanas.  PVA is a recyclable by-product of coal power electricity generation such as is found at Moneypoint, Co. Clare.  Slag is a recyclable by-product of steel manufacture and is available from Britain, north west France, Belgium and Holland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The Guidance Document does not require the use of any particular alternative cement — all are acceptable.  Neither does it require a particular percentage use of alternative cement.  Decisions on the type and quantity of alternative cements are left to the judgement of the specifying authority and are to be made in the context of the functional and technical requirements of the specific project.  In conforming with  EU procurement principles the Guidance Document avoids being specific in favour of any particular product or supplier.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">The Guidance Document does not make any proposal requiring the use of imported materials.  However, the OPW has made a number of assessments into the impact of increasing the use of alternative cements.  These assessments have included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1604">1) Cost abatement data produced by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) demonstrating that the use of alternative cements provides a cost-saving to the economy. (Ireland's Low Carbon Opportunity published in 2009)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1605">2) Consideration of the technical potentials as provided for in the National Concrete Standard IS EN 206 and demonstrated in recent projects using alternative cements e.g. the Jack Lynch tunnel in Cork, the Dundrum Luas Bridge in Dublin, the Shannon tunnel in Limerick and the National Conference Centre in Dublin.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1606">3) Assessment of the non-technical factors influencing the potential use of cements made in relation to critical factors outlined in the ‘Cement Technology Roadmap 2009' by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the International Energy Agency.  These indicate that Ireland has high potential for the use of alternative cements.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1607">4) Analysis of potential changes to carbon foot-printing methodologies and of potential transition to using full Life Cycle Analysis in material impact assessments.  Both of these demonstrate that alternative cements reduce the environmental impact of cement. Throughout Europe there is widespread use of alternative cements by reason of sustainability, technical issues and cost benefit.  All manufacturing facilities of cement production in Ireland benefit significantly from the European Trading Scheme (ETS) financial subsidy.  It is understood this will continue into the future providing employment assurance to manufacturers experiencing production slow down due to economic and other reasons.  It is noted that data from CemBureau (the European wide association of cement manufacturers) shows that there has been significant production over-capacity in the Irish cement industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1616">Some issues impacting on SMEs have already been addressed in the Jobs Initiative which includes the following key initiatives:</p>

            <p eId="para_1632">Within the Vote of this Department, programme funding is provided to Enterprise Ireland through two Subheads.  Funding under Subhead F covers the cost of Science, Technology and Innovation programmes.  This includes significant Research and Development programmes operated by Enterprise Ireland, aimed at providing direct and indirect research development and innovation supports for indigenous companies, supporting collaboration between industry and third level researchers and supporting the commercialisation of State funded research.  In 2010 there were no savings or underspends arising in these programmes.  While there was no capital carryover in the Enterprise Ireland F subhead in either 2010 or 2011, €2.15m of Own Resource Income generated by Enterprise Ireland in 2009 was profiled for and spent in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Funding under Subhead D2 provides for direct supports to Irish companies at all stages of development in respect of potential job creation and export growth.  It is aimed at supporting companies to scale and grow, building company capability in leadership, management and market skills, supporting companies in exploring new opportunities, and supporting business infrastructure.  Financing is through a mix of grants, equity and seed and venture capital investments, and contributions to third party agencies.  In 2010, there were savings of €3.3m under this subhead, which were voted to the County Enterprise Boards to support the micro-enterprise sector.  There was no carryover in either 2010 or 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The Temporary Employment Subsidy Scheme (Subhead L2) was introduced to help employees maintain their jobs while at the same time assisting employers to retain their productive capacity.  The Scheme was operated as part of an Irish State Aid scheme approved under the European Commission's Temporary Framework on State Aid, introduced in December 2008.  The Framework was brought in on a temporary basis to allow Member States increased flexibility to assist companies in the real economy that were facing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic downturn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">In order to qualify for support enterprises had to commit to retaining a multiple of the number of jobs they were in receipt of subsidies for until the end of November 2010.  An underspend of €21.14m arose in 2010 under the scheme, due to approved enterprises not maintaining the required number of committed jobs, as defined for the purposes of the scheme, for a given claim period.  An amendment to the Temporary Framework by the European Commission in December 2010 meant that it was not possible to secure approval for any prolongation of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">Outturns under subheads D and F for 2011 are not yet available and will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1679">My priority from the outset has been that any decision taken by Bank of America should have minimal impact on employees at the Carrick on Shannon operation and ensure that jobs are maintained at the facility. I emphasised this when I met with Senior Bank of America Executives in their Headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina in September. I am advised that the process regarding the sale of Bank of America's Irish and UK credit card businesses has not been unduly impacted by the ongoing Eurozone difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">There has been considerable interest in both the MBNA Ireland portfolio and the MBNA UK portfolio, which are likely to be sold separately, with negotiations regarding the sale of the MBNA Ireland portfolio considerably advanced.</p>

These roles will go by year end 2011, with the company hoping to achieve these on a voluntary basis. This decision, according to local Bank of America management, had been made in principle several months ago, prior to the group's decision to exit its international credit card business.</p>

            <p eId="para_1689">The Labour Court recommended in July 2008 that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by FÁS.  Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">The Deputy should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</p>

        <b>Deputy Finian McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         her plans to deal with social welfare fraud; if there are any accurate figures on the amount of persons involved in fraud and the amounts involved. 
        [38089/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_567">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1692">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week at a cost of some €21 billion per annum. However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">For 2011, my Department has a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and achieving €540 million in control savings. At the end of October, some €536 million in estimated control savings were reported and over 746,000 reviews have been carried out. For 2012, the target for control savings is provisionally set at €625 million, an increase of €85 million on the 2011 target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The only fraud that my Department knows about as a fact is, by definition, proven fraud. While there are many perceptions/suspicions of fraud and people knowing ‘for a fact' that a person is defrauding the social welfare system, these may not stand up to scrutiny.  In this regard, it should be noted that some 190,000 people work and legitimately receive a social welfare payment. It can sometimes be perceived by members of the public that these people are defrauding the social welfare system, when in fact they are not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">In 2010, total overpayments amounted to €83.4 million representing 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure. Overpayments arising from suspected fraudulent activity amounted to less than 0.1% of total Departmental expenditure in 2010.   It is important to emphasise, therefore, that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">As the Deputy may be aware, I recently launched a Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and at ensuring that public confidence in the system is improved. A key priority for my Department is to ensure that fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combated. Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and taxpayers</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">Under the Initiative, there will be greater liaison by my Department at both central and  local level and with employers, the business community generally and the groups representing social welfare recipients.  This will raise awareness among those interested parties of my Department's policies and projects in relation to dealing with fraud and abuse. Those stakeholders will be encouraged to pass on specific information and concerns to the Department with a view to tackling social welfare fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</p>

            <p eId="para_1703">The criteria for participating on community employment are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social protection payments.  There are two options under which community employment can be accessed.  In general, a person must be aged 25 or over to access community employment although some exceptions exist where a person is in receipt of disability-related payments, is a member of the Traveller community, a refugee or a young person recovering from drug misuse.</p>

            <p eId="para_1719">In order to be eligible to participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, an individual must:</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">currently be on the Live Register; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">have been in receipt of Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance or signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits for a total of 3 months or more in the last 6 months.  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is imperative to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that those availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will gain work experience and so be in a better position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">For these reasons, eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 months.  In so designing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Individuals who are in receipt of a disability allowance can access the FÁS Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months. During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.  In addition, people in receipt of a disability allowance can access a range of other specific programmes, such as the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Both of these programmes aim to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1725">The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) has operated since May 2004 with the aim of providing income support for eligible farmer and fishermen/women in receipt of specified, long-term social welfare payments.  The work undertaken by participants supports the provision of services of benefit to rural communities.  The RSS currently funds the engagement of 2,600 participants and 130 supervisors.  Supervisors are employed for 39 per week with participants required to work 19½ hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Overall responsibility for the operation of the RSS rests with the Department of Social Protection with responsibility for its day-to-operation resting with 35 Implementing Bodies comprising 34 local development companies and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  In general, participants on the RSS are required to work on a range of service provision within an overall framework for the scheme developed and delivered by the Implementing Body.  This framework takes account of movements in work requirements, new opportunities, completion of existing tasks, emerging pressures and priorities, weather and other matters that impact on the tasks undertaken.  I am confident that the Implementing Bodies for the RSS have the necessary strategies in place to manage any reduction in funding resulting from Budget adjustments by other Government Departments and Agencies.  I have no proposals to reduce the numbers supported by the RSS.</p>

RTÉ has informed me that it is only licensed to broadcast the relevant Euro 12 international games within the borders of this State because UEFA, as rights holders, licence broadcasters such as RTÉ strictly on a territorial basis.

            <p eId="para_1758">Petroleum exploration in Ireland, in common with most other jurisdictions, is carried out by private enterprise under licence from the State.  Petroleum exploration authorisations are issued under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and the operational framework is set out in the Licensing Terms for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development &amp; Production 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">I am aware that there has been a good deal of public interest recently on the topic of onshore gas exploration with considerable focus on the possibility of hydraulic fracturing technology being used following the award of onshore licensing options in February of this year.  The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are designed to allow the companies assess the shale gas potential of the acreage based on studies of existing data from previous exploration activity.  This work is largely office/desktop based and does not involve exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">By the end of the licensing option period in February 2013, the companies will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licence or relinquish the acreage.  In the event any of the companies involved decide to apply for an exploration licence that proposes the use of hydraulic fracturing, their application would be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment that would include a public consultation phase.  My Department would also seek and be guided by the expert advice of other relevant statutory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Local Authorities.  The outcome of the Environmental Impact Assessment would determine whether or not an exploration licence would be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">In the event that at some point in the future a commercial discovery of natural gas is made and an onshore gas extraction project is proposed then there is a comprehensive regulatory framework in place that would apply to any such proposal.  The development of such a project would require a number of statutory consents including a planning consent from An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, an Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with a Petroleum Lease, a Plan of Development consent and a Gas Pipeline consent from myself as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  A core element of these consent processes would be to consider the potential environmental impact of any proposed development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">It is too early to conclude at this point whether or not these licensing options will proceed to the exploration licence stage and much too early to anticipate a commercial discovery that could potentially lead to a natural gas production project.  Notwithstanding, this I have asked the EPA to examine the area and advise on the environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting natural gas.  The EPA has commenced research into the environmental considerations and impacts of shale gas exploration and extraction and into the regulatory approaches of other countries, with a view to helping to establish best environmental practice.  The EPA proposes to commission a further and more extensive study in 2012 and is liaising with my Department.  In the event that future studies on technological developments bring to light new issues, I will be happy to examine such matters and to consider the introduction of statutory measures if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1767">With effect from 1 July 2008, Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations introduced, among other things, the requirement for a new dwelling to source a reasonable proportion of its energy consumption from renewable energy sources.  The accompanying Technical Guidance Document (TGD L) outlines how this requirement can be achieved in practice by providing from renewable energy technologies a contribution of 10kWH/m2/annum towards domestic hot water heating, space heating or cooling or 4kWH/m2/annum of electrical energy or a combination of these which would have equivalent effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">Where a building or development contains more than one dwelling the requirement can be applied to each individual dwelling or as an average contribution from renewable technologies across all dwellings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">Under the Building Control Act, 1990 responsibility for compliance with the building regulations is first and foremost a matter for the owner and builder of a building.  Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 building control authorities.  The resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurers.  Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Building control authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and can issue enforcement notices in relation to contravention of the building regulations within a period of five years from the completion of the new dwelling.  Where necessary and appropriate they can also initiate enforcement proceedings to ensure compliance.  The Building Control Act 2007 includes provision for summary prosecution of offences in the District Court.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">The correspondence attached to the question includes a proposal for a revised system of motor taxation containing two elements, arising from a perceived unfairness due to different rates of motor tax applicable to similar cars, depending on the date of first registration — pre-July 2008 cars based on cubic capacity and post-July 2008 cars based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The first element of the proposal relates to car tax being used for the upkeep of the road network on the basis of the current motor tax system or alternatively related to the value of the vehicle.  The latter element is, in effect, already a feature of the taxation system through vehicle registration tax (VRT) where the tax applied is a percentage of the open market selling price.  The revenue collected goes to the Exchequer and expenditure derived from it is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The proceeds of annual motor tax are applied, via the Local Government Fund, to Local Authorities and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the bodies with responsibility for the upkeep of roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The second element of his proposal for motor tax suggests introducing a separate CO<sub>2</sub> tax based on fuel consumption.  The rate of motor tax for private vehicles first registered from July 2008 is linked to fuel consumption rates, as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions relate directly to the carbon content of the fuel consumed.  My reply to Question No. 354 of 22 November 2011 addresses the application of the CO<sub>2</sub>   system of motor taxation to vehicles registered prior to 01 July 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1829">In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department's overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Under the Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.  The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">Since the introduction of the retrofitting initiative in 2009, my Department has provided funding for energy efficiency improvement works to some 3,000 local authority dwellings across the country.  In 2011, some €31million is being provided to local authorities in respect of their improvement works programmes.  Under this year's programme there is a particular focus on returning vacant properties to productive use.  Works to occupied units may also be carried out, within the allocation provided, where the local authority considers this appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, recently published the Affordable Energy Strategy aimed at meeting an important commitment in the Programme for Government.  The strategy will be the framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">Both the Better Energy: Warmer Homes and Better Energy: Homes schemes, which are aimed at improving the energy efficiency and comfort levels of homes, are administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) and fall within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Any proposal to extend the benefits of these schemes to include social housing tenants is, in the first instance, a matter for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_1840">It has been decided that funding from the Department to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) must cease at the end of 2011.  On the basis of a value for money review it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI is being spent disproportionately. The largest proportion of PwDI's annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of programmes and services which would directly benefit people with disabilities. This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue, as people with disabilities were not benefiting sufficiently from the allocation in real terms. However, there is no reason why the local PwDI networks around the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies and continue their work with people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector. With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested to hear what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them. I have recently set up and chair a new Implementation Group to develop and progress the National Disability Strategy. This new group held its inaugural meeting yesterday, 30 November. It includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group. This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost-effective way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1844">To give effect to this commitment the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which provides for establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority, was amended at Committee Stage to expand the Authority's statutory functions to include the publication of residential property sales prices. This information will be supplied to the Authority on an ongoing basis by the Revenue Commissioners who are in receipt of it for stamp duty purposes.  In anticipation of enactment of the Bill the Implementation Group established to put in place the necessary arrangements for the establishment of the Authority has initiated work for establishment of the housing price database.

            <p eId="para_1850">As the Deputy is aware, the Courts Service informed me that, due to the lack of suitable premises in Castletownbere, the District court sittings were moved to Bantry with effect from 1 October 2010.  I was informed that the Court sat six times in 2010 dealing with only 232 matters.  Unfortunately, due to current economic conditions, the Courts Service is not in a position to provide a premises or facilities of an appropriate standard in Castletownbere and a proposal about its future is due for consideration at the next meeting of the Courts Service Board.  In the meantime, the sittings will continue to be held in Bantry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">The making of Statutory Instruments creating District Court districts and District Court areas is a matter for the Courts Service.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

            <p eId="para_1908">The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 15th July, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.

            <p eId="para_1914">The individual concerned claimed asylum in 2005 and the issue of refoulement was considered in the context of that asylum claim, which was ultimately rejected by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The refusal of the asylum claim was upheld on appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following the refusal of her asylum claim, the applicant's legal representatives submitted representations under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), which included material in relation to Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement. I am  satisfied that the representations submitted for consideration under Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, were given the fullest consideration before a  Deportation Order was made against this person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

            <p eId="para_1923">I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.  I have already expressed my unhappiness at the protracted nature of the investigations underway.  This is not a criticism of the investigators and prosecutors, who face tough challenges as a result of the complexities of the matters being investigated.  At the same time, I am anxious to ensure that I do not say anything which might jeopardise any prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">The Programme for Government contains a commitment that rogue bankers and all those that misappropriate or embezzle funds are properly pursued for their crimes and that the full rigours of the law will apply to them.  Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft, and seek Government approval to the introduction of, additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, was enacted on 2 August.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">The main purpose of the Act is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information, documentation and electronically held information to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">The Act provides for a new offence regarding failure to report information to the Gardaí which could prevent the commission of white collar crime or assist An Garda Síochána in an investigation into white collar crime.  The Act also contains provisions to protect whistleblowers who disclose information to An Garda Síochána relating to relevant offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">In addition, it provides for offences committed by persons or witnesses who are unwilling or reluctant to assist with an investigation.  The provisions of the Act include a new power for the Garda Síochána to apply to court for an order to require any person with relevant information to produce documents, answer questions and provide information for the purposes of the investigation of relevant offences.  Failure to comply with such an order will be an offence, punishable by way of a term of imprisonment or a fine or both.  This is a central provision of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">It is expected that the Act will provide vital assistance to An Garda Síochána in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">The decision to seek the extradition of a person charged with a criminal offence rests with the DPP and arises only where the Director has decided that a person should be prosecuted in the first instance.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Director is independent in the exercise of her functions and, as Minister, I have no function in deciding whether a person should be charged with an offence or whether a person's extradition should be sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">With regard to the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, I am informed by the Garda authorities that three investigation files and a supplementary file have to date been submitted to the Law Officers.  Directions are awaited.  The investigations by An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">Any allegations of criminality against any persons or business reported or made known to An Garda Síochána will be fully investigated.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1934">The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management have to ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons.  Gang members are being managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance to these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated. Intelligence on the ground would suggest that at any given time between 30% and 40% of the prison population has links to a criminal gang.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in Irish prisons, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">I can advise the Deputy it is not possible to provide the number of prisoners in this category who are due to be released in the next 12 months without the manual examination of prisoner files.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, I can inform the Deputy that there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs. Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1938">As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years.  The problem of prison overcrowding therefore remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">I share the view of the Thornton Hall Review Group that decisive action is required on a number of fronts in order to address the problem of overcrowding and poor physical conditions particularly in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons.  Whilst the reduced capital envelope this year will not allow the Prison Service to proceed with the construction of Thornton Hall or Kilworth prisons, this does not signal a reversal of the Government's decision earlier this year to approve in principle the recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall Review Group Report.  It has been necessary to defer the commencement of these projects but the Deputy can be assured that it is my strong intention to revisit the timeframe for their delivery in 12 months time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">Despite a reduction in the capital allocation available to the Prison Service in 2012, work will continue on the completion of a new 300 space prison wing in the Midlands Prison and it is expected that these spaces will be fully commissioned by mid 2012.  I can also advise the Deputy that an administrative building on the Dóchas Centre site has been converted into a new accommodation block which will provide an additional 70 spaces.  It is expected that this block will be ready for occupation in early 2012.  The opening of the new spaces at the Dóchas Centre will assist in alleviating the overcrowding issue.  It is expected that the new accommodation, which is dormitory style, will accommodate prisoners who are being held on remand and those serving short sentences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">I am also continuing to pursue alternatives to custody and progress is being made.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.  A number of key recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall Review Group Report are also receiving priority attention in my Department and many are in the process of being implemented, most notably the introduction of an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In this regard, a six month pilot project commenced in October 2011 in which it is envisaged that a total of 130 prisoners will participate.  To date, 39 prisoners have been released under the scheme with a further 18 due for release in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The Fines Act 2010 introduced measures to prevent the automatic imprisonment of fine defaulters.  I intend to bring forward new legislative proposals to introduce a system of "attachment orders" allowing a small amount of money to be taken from wages or social welfare facilitating the payment of the debt or fine over time.  The concept of restorative justice also has a place in the range of non-custodial options which are available for use by the courts.  The Deputy can be assured that my focus is to encourage the use of such options to the greatest extent possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2046">Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to harm or threaten, menace or in any other way intimidate or put in fear a person who is assisting in the investigation by An Garda Síochána of an offence or a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence or a member of his or her family, intending to obstruct, pervert or interfere with an investigation or the course of justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">The original penalty provided for in the 1999 Act upon being found guilty under this section was 10 years.  In view of the gravity with which this type of criminal activity is viewed, the penalty was increased to 15 years by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">I am informed by the Garda authorities that separate records are not maintained of offences under section 41 as between those directed against witnesses and those directed against jurors.  Accordingly, the information available from the Gardaí covers both categories of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that, of their nature, instances of intimidation of jurors are less likely to come to notice than instances of witness intimidation.  The Gardaí rigorously enforce the provisions of the law relating to witness and jury intimidation and, of course, will continue to do so. The table below shows the position with regard to the number of proceedings commenced and convictions for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the period from 2006 to 29 November 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_2073">As I have indicated to this House on many occasions, tackling crime, and bringing those involved to justice, is a priority for the Government.   At operational level the implementation of specific measures to deal with those engaging in criminal activity is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">In that context Garda management closely monitors the allocation of resources with reference to crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Additionally, the Garda authorities are satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service continues to be delivered and that the current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient service to the community.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2076">Since being appointed Minister for Defence I have had one approach from this Society and met with three of their representatives in June last. At that meeting they outlined their concerns on a number of incidents that had occurred in the Curragh over recent years and sought the introduction of a number of measures that had been proposed by the Inter-Departmental Task Force on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare including the establishment of a Statutory Authority under the aegis of the Minister for Defence to manage the Curragh with the exception of the Defence Forces Training Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">At that time I indicated that the establishment of such a body as a separate agency under the aegis of my Department would have involved additional costs in terms of staff, accommodation, expenses and payments to members of the Authority, which would be significantly greater than the costs incurred by the Department in administering the Curragh Lands. As you are aware the Government has targeted the rationalisation of State agencies as a key cost saving measure. In that context it would be inappropriate and indeed costly to establish a separate agency to manage work currently being done economically by the staff of the Department. Given the requirements of administrative efficiency, and the technical issues raised in relation to the role of the Minister as the final arbiter in disputes relating to the use of the Curragh Lands, it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of the Authority, which was a primary focus of the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Task Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The way forward now will involve a review by the Department of the varying usage of the lands by a range of different interests in the Curragh, not least the Defence Forces, with a view to establishing how these can be best accommodated and managed within the existing administrative framework and within existing resources. The question of the requirement for legislation to address any other issues in relation to the Curragh Lands can then be examined in this context. This work will proceed as resources allow, given the competing demands on the Department's staff and resources and the need to prioritise issues and allocate reducing resources to the core Defence policy and operational issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">I understand that the Deputy accompanied representatives of the Society at a meeting with one of my predecessors when the general position as outlined above was conveyed to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2116">Food Harvest 2020 has a target of a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  I believe this target can be achieved through a focused and determined implementation of the report's recommendations for the dairy sector, which include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2117">(i) the need to improve on-farm competitiveness through, for example, animal health and genetic improvement programmes as well as increased efficiency through education and technology transfer,</p>

            <p eId="para_2120">It is a matter for the dairy processing industry as to what their capital requirements will be to ensure the provision of adequate processing capacity.  However, it is encouraging that the importance of the issue has been acknowledged in the Dairy Expansion Activation Group's Road Map for the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 in the dairy sector, which contains specific actions required at processing level.  I am confident that the processing industry will respond as necessary and will work with the rest of the sector to ensure that the <i>Food Harvest 2020</i> objectives are met.</p>

For the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol eligible forests (i.e. those planted since 1990) will sequester 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>  ) over the 5-year period to the end of 2012 (2.6 million tonnes in 2010).

The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">Ethiopia, as it is not a signatory of the Hague Convention,  is covered by Section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010. The opening of negotiations on such a bilateral would require an analysis of</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">the current situation regarding adoptions in Ethiopia;</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">issues regarding the compatibility of the laws between the two countries and</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">the plans of that jurisdiction vis a vis the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">The AAI have indicated that certain issues could arise that would require detailed consideration, especially issues relating to the effect of Ethiopian adoptions in the context of the Adoption Act 2010.  My Department is in regular and ongoing contact with the AAI and the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia in order to assess possible next steps vis a vis that jurisdiction.  However further action will have to have regard for the wider work programme of the AAI and agreed priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in inter-country adoption, the Adoption Authority of Ireland  have indicated that their first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries. The AAI have recently returned from the USA and now intend to develop an administrative arrangement with the USA for inter-country adoption. In the coming weeks the AAI intends to visit  Mexico and Vietnam in the context of entering into administrative arrangements with both those jurisdictions, the latter being dependent on the entering into force of the Hague convention in Vietnam on 1 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">I am extremely conscious that the Authority have a full work programme in the terms of these countries as well as the important upcoming priority of our engagement with Vietnam.  In addition, the Authority and my officials will be undertaking exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">The Authority must also prioritise checks of legal compatibility with a wide range of jurisdictions in order to process applications for the recognition of the adoptions of children already adopted from abroad by Irish citizens. These are desktop reviews requiring legal advices but are urgently required to regulate the status of children already adopted.</p>

The HAA card entitles holders to avail of a broad range of health services free of charge.

            <p eId="para_2193">The OECD's <i>Health At A Glance 2011: OECD Indicators</i> presents the most recent comparable data on key indicators of health and health systems across OECD countries.  This includes data on cancer incidence, mortality and five-year relative survival.  While it is welcome that the report mentions notable increases in breast cancer survival rates in Ireland, it also shows that survival rates for cervical, breast and colorectal cancer lag behind the OECD average, with the five-year survival rate for cervical cancer being the lowest in the OECD 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">These data refer to cancers detected in 2004 or latest available year (cancers diagnosed in 2001-2003 in the case of Ireland) and followed up until 2008.  For this reason the establishment of the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in late 2007 and the subsequent changes in the organisation and delivery of cancer services in Ireland within the eight cancer centres are not yet reflected in these data.  International evidence shows that the best outcomes for cancer patients are achieved by specialist teams in specialist settings, with access to ongoing education, training, research and peer review.  Accordingly, the NCCP has been working to centralise diagnosis and treatment for cancer in eight designated cancer centres and has made considerable progress in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">Cancer screening is also key to improving survival and can play a role both in prevention (cervical and colorectal screening) as well as early detection.  The OECD data do not reflect the introduction in 2008 of CervicalCheck, which last year screened 329,000 women, or the completion of the national roll-out of BreastCheck, which in 2010 screened over 118,000 women.  In addition to these programmes, work is continuing on the introduction of a national colorectal cancer screening programme in mid-2012.  These measures should be reflected in improved Irish cancer survival rates in the coming years.</p>

Acute bed numbers in public hospitals are counted as an average of beds available over each year, given that the number of beds available in each hospital can vary over any year for operational reasons.

            <p eId="para_2240">As part of plans to reduce Government costs, this Government decided, on coming to power, to set an example by withdrawing State cars from all members of the Cabinet except the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence. It is estimated that this will result in an annual saving of €4m per annum to the State.  Other members of the Government, and the Ceann Comhairle, now provide their own cars.  State cars are driven by Gardaí, and as such receive exemptions from a wide range of traffic and parking regulations.  Among other exemptions, Gardaí have the right to use bus lanes.  As a consequence, with civilian rather than Garda drivers, Ministers no longer had the exemptions which applied to their predecessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2241">The Government subsequently decided that, in order to facilitate the business of Government and the Dáil, members of the Government, the Attorney General, Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet (i.e. the Chief Whip and super-junior Minister — no other Minister of State has this right), and the Ceann Comhairle, should only be allowed to retain the traffic exemption of travelling in with-flow bus lanes, while on official business.  This is not some new privilege.  It means that Ministers, like their predecessors, can avail of bus lanes whilst on official business to get to official functions on time.</p>

Accordingly, a significant volume of work will be required, including the provision of an appropriate framework of law and international agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">It is intended that, initially, mutual recognition will be applied to a four penalty points offences; namely, drink driving, speeding, use of a mobile phone while driving and non-use of a safety belt.</p>
