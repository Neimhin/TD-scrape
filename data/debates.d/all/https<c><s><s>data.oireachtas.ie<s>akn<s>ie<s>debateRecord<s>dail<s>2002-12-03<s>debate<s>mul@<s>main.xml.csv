#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.The abridged Estimates for public services, which were published on 14 November, include an Estimate of €23.641 million for my Department in 2003. This includes a provision of €1.65 million for information society initiatives in my Department, of which approximately €1.1 million relates to the e-Cabinet project. The revised figure is based on the latest estimate of the cost of completing the project, which is still on target for completion next year.Funding for the National Economic and Social Council is provided in subhead C of my Department's Vote, which has been reduced by 14%. NESC, together with the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, will come under the umbrella of the new National Economic and Social Development Office next year. Funding for the four bodies taken together reflects the efficiencies which will be achieved by co-ordinating the activities of the three existing bodies under NESDO.No increases in charges to individuals, companies or groups have been sanctioned by agencies or units under the aegis of my Department.The Estimate will be submitted to the House early next year in the usual way and will be considered by the Committee on Finance and the Public Service in accordance with the procedures set out in Standing Orders. It is only in the context of that process that the matter of a general statement arises.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The defeat of the first Nice treaty referendum caused considerable controversy for the political process, the Government and political parties. The second referendum on the Nice treaty was carried because of the ability to interact and empathise with people and the attempt to deal with their concerns over the treaty. The preparations for the next phase of European integration are well under way and there will be an even more important and fundamental treaty to come arising from the next Intergovernmental Conference. Why has the Estimate for the budget of the National Forum on Europe been slashed by 65%? Is it not important for that body to be properly funded in order to continue its work of dialogue and interaction with the community?Given that the Northern Ireland Assembly is in suspension and the desire of every Member of this House not to see a vacuum created, after setting up the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, why does the Taoiseach's Estimate only contain an allocation of €1,000 for next year? Does the Taoiseach not envisage further meetings of the body?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Deputy has two questions; I will start with the second one. When the Esti mates were prepared in mid year, it was not envisaged there would be a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation this year, so the figure was an indicative amount. If there are more meetings, obviously there will be more costs than that. The figure was just to keep the subhead alive. At this stage I assume there will be more meetings and I will need to find the resources from within my Estimate. Even if all goes well it will be late spring at the earliest before we get anywhere.The figure of €700,000 for the National Forum on Europe covers the expenditure to complete the work set out by the chairman of the forum last year on two separate occasions. The forum travelled throughout the country, which built up some considerable cost. The costs of setting up the forum were incurred last year and the small secretariat is in place. However, the forum will continue and it has a work programme certainly up to next summer. I believe it will continue throughout 2003 and I am told by our finance officer that the resources provided are sufficient to meet the expenditure to complete the work agenda, as set out by the chairman.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Estimates indicate that €9.8 million is set aside for salaries, expenses and allowances. How much of this is earmarked for special advisers and media advisers in the Department of the Taoiseach? How many people in each of these categories are hired on a contract basis? From the press reports I have seen, at least one of these people is receiving remuneration in excess of a Cabinet Minister. Can the Taoiseach give me his views on that? I have no doubt that many Members will share the surprise and concern of members of the public at that fact.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Some €9.8 million or 68% of the budget for my Department goes on salaries and wages. There are approximately 250 people in my Department and that excludes the Offices of the Attorney General, the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor, which come under my Vote. About five of those would come within the category of the people mentioned by the Deputy. I gave the full information in answer to a question tabled by Deputy Rabbitte in the past week or two. Obviously we are talking about the programme managers. When people come in at that level, they can retain the salary they had, plus up to about 10%. That is the system in operation. It always depends on from where an individual comes and the work he or she does. I have given the figures a number of times previously. That is the basis of the figure. If, as in this case, a person comes from the private sector – he had been employed in the public sector before – he or she will be employed on the basis of his or her previous salary. This will then be updated as per the national agreements. The person in question has been out of the private sector for five years.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Taoiseach informed us that the allocation for the Central Statistics Office will require that consideration be given to phasing a number of initiatives and deferring a number of new projects. To what initiatives is he referring? Do they include, for example, the national employment survey? Does he agree the survey ought to be allowed to carry out its work fully in order that it is completed in early 2003 and that it is an important benchmark, to use that word again, of how the economy and employment are performing? Will the Taoiseach take stock of the widespread concern that the Government lacks interest in the Convention on the Future of Europe? When one considers that the Forum on Europe is having its funding reduced, this concern appears to have some validity.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am not sure how this relates to the issues covered by the questions. The Deputy is getting into the detail and specifics of the matters raised.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	7	My questions relate to the allocations for the Taoiseach's Department which indicate the Government's lack of interest in the Convention on the Future of Europe.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I have already answered that. There are sufficient resources for the Forum on Europe to continue its work both in Dublin Castle and on a countrywide basis. Its set-up costs are not repeated. This work has now been undertaken and the forum uses the same secretariat as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Therefore, no additional expenditure is required. This would be the case if a number of meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation were held which, I hope, will not be the case.With regard to the CSO allocation of more than €32 million for 2003, there is a cutback related to exceptional expenditure associated with the undertaking of the census of population. The Estimate figures for the CSO this year were high because of the census, the cost of enumerators and other associated costs. The net allocation of €32.96 million is lower than what the CSO required. The changes cover the planned implementation phase of an IT strategy which depends on additional funding and will not be able to go ahead. Census processing will be limited to core requirements, including place of work coding. The new short-term, economy-wide earnings survey will be phased in more slowly, although it will still start next year. The IT systems for the management information framework will probably not be purchased next year. Even after these changes, the CSO claims it will be able to carry out all its other work. Next year, it will probably not be able to get involved in some of the areas it wanted to enter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The employment survey will proceed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	10	All its normal work will proceed. Only new work will be affected. The monthly employment survey forms part of the CSO's everyday costs.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Is the Taoiseach aware that the recently published global competitiveness report indicated that Ireland has slipped from 11th to 24th position in terms of overall competitiveness? Is he also aware that Ireland now ranks 25th out of 30 OECD countries in terms of broadband access? Relating this to his Department, how does he justify the 9% reduction in the budget for the Information Society Commission, the body charged with driving the entire broadband roll-out? How does the Taoiseach justify the cut of 34% in funding for the information society and the e-Cabinet initiatives? These are fundamental to our overall competitiveness and the way that outside investors look at this country.Is there a formal Government decision to go ahead with the implementation of broadband cable access in every house in the country, taking into account the question of wireless and what it would mean, in terms of efficiency and speed, in regard to using the same facilities?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The last question might be more appropriate to another Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I appreciate that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	14	There are technical issues that need to be resolved in regard to the e-Cabinet initiative, centring around the security of the system. It is not yet possible to anticipate precisely how this might impact on the overall costs of implementation. Additional funding is required in the context of leveraging wider benefits in regard to secure e-mail for Departments.Next year will not be a difficult year in most of the areas in the e-Government project. The project is up and running, as is the test work. Much of the expenditure in 2001 was of a substantial nature and a similar investment will probably be required in a year or two in order to purchase equipment and hardware. There is no difficulty for this year.Much of the work on broadband for the information society falls within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. There are few charges on my Department, apart from staff who are involved in the administration end, which is covered in the Estimate.If resources were more plentiful there are many projects on which the Information Society Commission would like to make progress, some of which are more expensive than others. This year we need to be more prudent than, perhaps, we were in the past few years when we were able to get a number of these projects up and running. We will continue to work on e-Government, which is our main project. It will not be affected.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In the Taoiseach's reply to me earlier, he indicated that the programme manager was possibly the individual I focused on in regard to the generous level of remuneration received. Are there others within the Taoiseach's Department, or indeed, any other Department, who are currently in receipt of remuneration in excess of that of a Minister?The Taoiseach made the point that such people are recruited on the basis of their level of income in the private sector, plus 10%. We have a highly professional Civil Service and it begs the question, are we paying an exorbitant rate, given that the skills would be there among the experienced professional civil servants from which could be drawn the appropriate personnel to cover these respective functions. It merits some clarification of the Taoiseach's thinking on that issue.The National Forum on Europe has already been mentioned in regard to the allocation of some €700,000 in the Book of Estimates for the coming year. The Taoiseach has, in part, answered some of the questions which I would have wished to put to him in this regard. How does he envisage it progressing in the current year, and will the National Forum on Europe be used to address in open debate the proposed EU constitution?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	16	As I pointed out to Deputy Sargent, I cannot see how that is included under the eight questions the Taoiseach is answering.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	17	There is an allocation of €700,000 for the Forum on Europe in the Book of Estimates for the Taoiseach's Department. I am trying to establish how that will actually be used and if the sum incorporates addressing the issue of the EU constitution.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Yes, is the answer to the latter question. The Forum on Europe will resume next year. Its work will primarily, but not exclusively, be on the convention on Europe and matters related to that. The broad basis of open discussion over the past 16 months or so should continue and the forum has sufficient resources to continue to work and to travel to the regions, as it did previously. There is no difficulty with that.Returning to the staff issue, not many individuals are involved. There are no others in my Department but if an individual is attracted from the private sector to take up work in the political system, he or she is hardly likely to do so for less money. A small number of people have been attracted over the years and brought their own expertise to the system. Once they are in the system, they do not get increases other than the normal national agreement increases.Among my five people, there are civil servants who receive less remuneration but one takes on the responsibilities of the job and they are not spread equally. A person who undertakes the job of programme manager to the Taoiseach takes on  more responsibilities than others and that is why he or she is paid the salary he or she is paid.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Was it ever considered that the funding for the Forum on Europe and the Convention on the Future of Europe should be allocated by the same Department? Why is it envisaged that a two-pronged approach will continue given that the Forum on Europe will undertake considerable work that will be required in discussing the outcome of the convention? Why is the Taoiseach's Department dealing with one aspect of the job while the Department of Foreign Affairs deals with another aspect given that the Irish participants on the convention on Europe complain that it is not getting sufficient funding? The Taoiseach ought to take a lead role in remedying that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The secretariat of the forum is based in my Department and the practice has been that if there is a forum, such as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it is a function of my Department. The Department of Finance dealt with the difficulty regarding the convention, to which the Deputy referred, and I understand the difficulty has been resolved for those individuals. Staff and resources were made available to the individuals on the forum by the Department of Finance, even though the Department of Foreign Affairs takes the lead role in the administration of the forum.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.An independent evaluation of the progress of the change and modernisation programme in the Civil Service was completed by PA Consulting in March 2002. The evaluation concluded that the Civil Service is a more effective organisation than it was a decade ago and that much of this change can be attributed to the Strategic Management Initiative. However, the evaluation also concluded that implementation of the modernisation programme is not yet complete and that further progress is required in all key components of the process.The Government noted the evaluation and asked the implementation group of Secretaries  General to oversee the development of a new vision statement, strategy and action plan for the modernisation of the Civil Service up to 2007 in response to the findings and recommendations of the evaluation.The steering group of assistant secretaries, which oversaw the evaluation process, has been asked by the implementation group to prepare a draft of this new vision statement, strategy and action plan. In parallel with the preparation of this draft, the implementation group is pursuing specific developments in the areas of human resources, information technology, customer service, financial management and communications. These will be reflected in an integrated action plan to guide the modernisation of the Civil Service over the medium term. The steering group has commenced its work in drawing together the work in each of these areas and I expect that a draft will be submitted to the implementation group, and subsequently to the Government, early in 2003.In addition, the work of the implementation group is being reflected in the management approach to the discussions with the trade unions on modernisation of the Civil Service arising from the report of the benchmarking body.Of course, one of the key ways to deliver change and improved performance in public and private sector organisations is through partnership. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance has a key role to play in this regard. The overall objective of the centre is to provide strategic support for organisational change and improved performance in both private and public sector organisations. The strategic priorities guiding the centre's work are set out in its strategy and operational plan for 2002 to 2005, which was published in March of this year following an intensive process of consultation. Over the last year, the centre's activities have been directed at the priority areas identified in this strategic plan. These include disseminating good practice and providing practical support for organisational change; research and policy development; support for training and facilitation; campaigning for change through partnership; and auditing partnership activities in key sectors.In providing practical support for organisations and companies involved in change through partnership, the centre published guidelines for the private sector in July and is currently preparing similar guidelines for the public sector. It is also working closely with key sectors in repositioning partnership around the major change agendas. For example, it hosted a national seminar in October for the health sector on the implementation of the health strategy through partnership and has prepared a report for the Minister outlining key recommendations for the way forward. In addition the centre is developing a number of tools such as a competency framework for those involved in managing change through partnership.In the area of policy development, the centre is currently working with IBEC and ICTU  developing guidelines on employee financial involvement and new forms of financial reward. The centre has recently been contracted by the EU Commission to conduct research on innovative ways of providing for information and consultation within organisations. Preparatory work on the establishment of a forum on the workplace of the future is well advanced, in line with An Agreed Programme for Government. Among the many other activities of the centre are the development of an interactive website facility to assist organisations in undertaking change; the publication of information bulletins; a joint project with FÁS to help implement a learning strategy in public and private sector organisations; and the development of a public sector partnership network to promote shared learning.The centre has a high level council and has also established two key national structures to drive its ambitious programme forward. First, the National Research Advisory Panel, comprising 23 research institutions, advises the centre on its wide-ranging research programme. Second, the Network of Strategic Alliance Partners has been established to co-ordinate the efforts of key Government agencies and Departments at national level to bring improved performance through partnership.Details of these and the other activities of the NCPP are available on the centre's website. I believe that its work to date has now placed the centre in a position to make a real contribution to organisational change over the coming years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Through no fault of anyone here Taoiseach's Question Time sometimes becomes very boring. When we discuss the strategic management initiative it becomes seriously so. Is the Taoiseach at all persuaded that SMI is making a major tangible difference in the Civil Service? Apart from what he has just read out could he list three tangible things that are done differently and better in the Civil Service as a result of SMI? Is the PA Consulting report in the public domain?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	23	It is.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I confess I have not read it. I may do so at Christmas time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	25	It is summer time reading.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	26	In the meantime could the Taoiseach tell us what is in it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I would not inflict the report on Deputy Rabbitte for his Christmas reading.I accept that much of the strategic management initiative makes heavy weather. I have been answering questions on it long enough to see that.One of the things I did as part of the PA survey last year was to try to improve alignment between SMI and the political process so that we would have some meaningful input into it.I have identified a number of areas of successful reform. For example, the use of Cabinet com mittees and the submission of strategy statements to Ministers have worked well in Departments. This time around whole Departments are involved with regard to what they are doing and how they might do it better. The process is engaging civil servants. It is not perfect but the aims and objectives are being looked at and people are involved at all levels, not just the senior half a dozen or dozen people involved, which is a good thing. If Departments are to have business plans because of the SMI process, it is good. Secondly, the way in which the public is dealt with has changed dramatically. The customer service initiatives in the Departments, not only in terms of their websites but in how they deal with the public, are also good. Thirdly, the fact that on this occasion the modernisation process was linked directly to pay gave people an incentive to try to make things change and improve things.The last 4% pay increase was directly related to the process, which makes people interested in achieving things. The monitoring of that has still to happen, as I pointed out. An awful lot has to be done in determining how work is rewarded and ensuring that everyone is not rewarded regardless of performance. Deputy Rabbitte will be very familiar with how that process works, but I still think more could be done.If the SMI – which is now ten years in operation – is to be successful, it has to keep changing. The technology in Departments has changed dramatically in the past ten years. Perhaps this would have happened to a considerable extent without SMI, but the level of IT in all Departments has increased so much that it allows for new opportunities and new ways forward.It must be remembered that the entire benchmarking report is linked to modernisation going forward and the involvement of people, not only in the Civil Service. The PA Consulting report was just about the Civil Service. There are other aspects of health and education that require another day's work.A large part of what the PA Consulting report said, in a critical way, concerned the financial management systems. It put a lot of work and effort into how Departments work the financial management systems. It will take a good few years just to improve financial management and human resource management in Departments. The report was quite critical in this regard. It is the big challenge for now and probably for the next five years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Has any consideration been given to locating middle-ranking civil servants in the private sector for a period and – heresy of heresies – vice versa, as Fluther Good would say, in terms of locating people with private sector experience in the Civil Service?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	29	That is permitted. I do not know if the exchange mechanism came in under an early part of SMI or not, but civil servants can  work in outside agencies or some people from outside agencies can work in the Civil Service. It is not done much. I cannot tell what number of people is involved in it, but it is permitted—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	30	It is negligible.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I agree, I think it is very small. I have been at some of the conferences of the people who work on the SMI with Departments and I know some of Deputy Rabbitte's own party's backbenchers attend some of them because they tend to be open conferences. I readily admit that it is heavy weather, and the only way that the staff and others will see benefits is if they feel they have a say in what their Department is doing and if their input is linked to pay. If staff feel they cannot move within the system they will not benefit from the initiatives of the SMI and National Centre for Partnership and Performance. The centre is considering the position in other countries and the private sector. Its agenda will drive new ideas, which will be useful.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	32	There are parallels here with the better local government initiative. On the one hand there are repeated conferences and seminars concerned with how these initiatives should be managed effectively in the public interest, yet on the other hand, decision makers within the Civil Service or local authorities are very hard to find because of their attendance at seminars, conferences and courses. As a consequence there is a huge backlog of work in local authorities and Departments.Will the Taoiseach indicate the position regarding the ongoing projects undertaken by the National Centre for Partnership and Performance? For example, what is meant by the learning for monitoring project? The centre is also involved in the compilation of a database of case studies of good practice in organisational change. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on what is involved in this and will he confirm that the centre's budget will allow both of these projects to be concluded and, if so, will he indicate what the conclusion might entail?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The NCPP is engaged in an enormous amount of work, much of which is centred on the use of seminars and best practice. I have had the pleasure of opening a number of seminars within the Civil Service. I appreciate Deputy Kenny's concerns about the difficulty in contacting decision makers who may be attending conferences and seminars.Last March the NCPP launched its operational programme and last July it set out its plans and a way for working for partnership guidance for a unionised commercial sector, which has been useful for trade unions and management. Last October it conducted a health sector seminar which considered the implications of the national health strategy for the partnership process. It has  driven much of the seminar's programme on the ground in the health area.The centre has an ongoing bulletin and the database on best practice, to which the Deputy referred, has been established. In addition, the centre has conducted a number of focus groups covering different staff elements. The forum on the workplace of the future, which is a critical component in the attempt to align workplaces with the competitive vision of the country, seeks to help workers to see there is a benefit in all our efforts to make the country more competitive and have it move up the international competitiveness league. It is also seeking to convince people that it is in their interest to involve businesses in high value added products.The NCPP is made up of employers, trade unions and Departments working together on these initiatives and it does much excellent work. The centre is engaged in repositioning the partnership process that has been under way for 15 years, linking organisational change to the operations of business and public service organisations and making work more attractive for people on the ground. It also seeks to build leadership and develop a vision for the future covering workplace relations and present economic circumstances.For some years the accusation was that partnership only operated at the top and not on the factory or office floor. They are making an effort now to drive through change and make the connection between what the boardroom or the Secretaries General think and what the workers think. It is not an easy thing to do or to carry right throughout the public sector, which employs 300,000 people. They are at least getting people involved. I am not foolish enough to think one can change all of this in a short period. It has been in place for ten years now and we are into the next stage. Some of the things they are doing are meaningful even if it takes quite a lot of conferences to get all this through.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	34	There is some merit in what the Taoiseach says and I do not wish at all to run down the performance of members of the Civil Service. They also want to give the best response possible to the public. Will the Taoiseach agree that there is enormous pressure on experienced and very able civil servants to drift into the private sector where lucrative offers are constantly being made to them? This has to be a cause of concern because people of ability are required in order to run Departments. Does the Taoiseach envisage the production of a concluding report to the Dáil for discussion or analysis, that is if we are able to read and understand it? It might be of some relevance to legislators and those who allocate budgets to Departments.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	35	As I said earlier in reply to Deputy Rabbitte about the PA report, one of the big parts is trying to link all this to the political process. A large part of the work of the public  service is serving the public and working for the people who are elected by the public, so there must be a link between them. The next major part of it is to do with management and finance. I will re-circulate the PA report to the House because it is some months since it was published. I will make sure that Members also receive copies of the management report when it becomes available. It has been stated very clearly that the political dimension and the interest of this House and of politicians should be engaged. In the last Dáil I set up the committee on strategic management and a small number of Members took a particular interest in it. The centre now sends bulletins to Departments and I will request that all Oireachtas Members receive the reports when they are issued.

The idea of recruiting from the private sector into Government Departments is of itself a very negative flag to wave at those within the Civil Service. I am of the view that it is something that perhaps causes a discordant note within the wider—

I do not believe that recruitment from the private sector into the Civil Service is confined only to the highest level within his own Department and as has already been responded to. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that recruitment from the private sector into the Civil Service coupled with successive Governments' penchant for privatisation of public companies is a serious discouragement and undermining of the morale of people within the Civil Service? If one is talking about an action programme for the modernisation of the service, one must be committed to the Civil Service and, indeed, to the ethos of developing the public sector. What are the Taoiseach's views on this? Does he not recognise that any review must entail a serious re-evaluation of Government policy in both of these related areas?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Reference was made earlier to the people involved. It gives people opportunities. People from the private sector can work in and bring their expertise to the Civil Service while civil servants can benefit by working in the private sector. There are certainly benefits in the system. That cross over of work will not be of any great harm unless it involves large numbers, about which we are not talking. There are 30,000 civil servants.There is much work going on in relation to SMI, customer service initiatives and various evaluations. The officials involved in one way or another in the PA report are always looking to change. They do not want things to stay the same but want to improve things. The PA consultants  involved themselves directly with 23 Secretaries General, 120 Assistant Secretaries, 170 principal officers, 22 partnership committees, 70 functional heads and 4,500 civil servants through direct questionnaires.It was not that the Civil Service had closed its mind; it wants to interact and to do things in a different way. All this work of looking for a new mission statement, strategy and action plan is so it can feel part of a changing system, make jobs more relevant, make the service more attractive and play a bigger part in the change management network in the public service. It is not fearful of this in any way. Nobody is talking about privatising the Civil Service. I have never heard that mentioned in my lifetime and it should not be a concern.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	40	In respect of the question on the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, does the Taoiseach agree that the future of social partnership, if not now but in the medium term of securing another social contract, is made more difficult if the concept of partnership is not translated more effectively to local level? Does he agree that little enough progress has been made in translating any meaningful sense of partnership to the level of local enterprise in many sectors?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That is true in many sectors. Five years ago I think it was true of all sectors and it is only in recent times that we have local participation. Good case studies have been documented by the trade unions and by the National Centre for Partnership and Performance on how it can be done differently. The challenge for us to try to get more places to do that. The health service and the local authorities have started. It can work well where rank and file staff hold chairperson or secretary positions on these partnership committees as it gives them greater involvement in work. We should have far more such committees. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance is endeavouring to take models which are well developed, whether in the public or private sector, and to try to expand them into other areas. I agree there are not enough but the models it has are good and we should be supportive of its efforts to drive them out into other areas.I am also aware there are places which do not want these types of partnerships and I am not including them as that is a different issue. Some employments run a mile or find every excuse not to implement them but I am thinking of those open to it where we should drive it on. There is a problem with those which have closed minds on this.

Ar lámh amháin tá sé ag  rá gur cheart airgead a chaitheamh ar infrastruchtúr. Nuair a dhéanaim airgead na Gaeltachta a roinnt idir infrastruchtúr agus airgead don údarás tá sé ag tabhairt amach. Nuair a bhí a pháirtí féin i Rialtas ní raibh pingin á chaitheamh ar bhóithre na Gaeltachta. Tá plean mór ag an Rialtas á chur i bhfeidhm bliain i ndiaidh bliana ar bhóithre straitéiseacha na Gaeltachta.

Ní fheicim gur gá gach foirgneamh a thógáil. Tá cead tugtha agam don údarás breathnú, mar shampla, ar dheontais a thabhairt seachas gach foirgneamh a thógáil é féin. Níl amhras orm ach gur bealach i bhfad níos costasaí le foirgnimh a thógáil ná go dtógfadh an t-údarás féin iad.Tá mé ag plé leis an údarás chomh maith maidir le roinn sealúchas a dhíol.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	47	As I stated in reply to the Deputy's question of 26 June 2002, while no formal costing has been done in regard to the full implementation of the Official Languages (Equality) Bill, 2002, clearly there will be cost issues involved, particularly at start-up. Additional costs are likely to arise in connection with matters such as the establishment of the office of the Official Languages Commissioner, training, and bilingual and translation services. However, costs for individual Departments or State bodies, or on an overall basis, cannot be established until individual schemes have been agreed in accordance with the proposed legislation. For Departments complying with the non-statutory guidelines regarding the Irish language introduced some years ago, no significant costs should arise.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	48	My concern is that, in effect, an aspirational Bill could be passed into law because the costing has not been done. We could end up with something that really does not promote the Irish language at all. I draw the Minister's attention to the provision of the Bill relating to legal proceedings, whereby people can ask to have their legal proceedings in either language. Looking at the courts system as a whole, providing translation facilities and so on for court cases would be a huge operation. Surely something as large as this in terms of cost is something the Department has looked at.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I am surprised at the Deputy's question because my predecessor, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, introduced voluntary guidelines, and he told us for years that these were working perfectly. The onus in relation to the Irish language under those voluntary guidelines is actually greater than I propose in this legislation. Allowing, no doubt, that he was successful in getting everybody to follow these guidelines, there will be no extra onus on the Department or any other agent of the State involved in implementing the voluntary guidelines. Or, is the Deputy telling me that those voluntary guidelines were just a sham?
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The Minister is well aware that there is a marked difference in practice between statutory obligations and voluntary guidelines. We are heading into a situation where people can demand certain services if they so desire. That there have been voluntary guidelines in operation is one scenario, but the Minister is moving this a step further, to a point where there will be a statutory obligation to provide services. That is the difference here. We do not need any sort of smart aleck talk about what somebody did in the past, we are focusing now on the future, I hope in a positive and constructive way. The Minister has not assured me in anything he said that his Department has gone into this in any depth in terms of the obligations that will arise. Has he carried out an investigation of any description in regard to the court scene?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	51	In relation to issues in general and to the court scene, there is an existing constitutional right in relation to the Irish language and there have been court rulings in this regard. Therefore, in large measure, some of these rights already exist in law for anyone who wishes to exercise them. In those circumstances, I do not believe that costs will be a major problem. There will be some minor costs in setting up a specific office to monitor the Bill, but I imagine its implementation will much more relate to the efficient organising of existing resources rather than additional resources.I have never understood why anyone would think that the appointment of people who are both Irish and English speakers to provide services to, for example, Gaeltacht areas would be any more expensive than the appointment of people who are English speakers only. This is more about planning and organisation than about costs. It is about targeting resources and using technology to make sure those resources are targeted where they are needed to provide the necessary services. That is what these plans are about. My Department will not receive any additional allocation to its administration budget to administer services even though it provides much more bilingual services than most Departments.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient Irish speakers, people who are líofa a dhóthain, to provide the necessary services across the wide range of Departments, Government agencies and so on listed in the Bill? The number of people who have líofacht as Gaeilge in the Civil Service is not what it is used to be.

The Deputy is probably right in that there may not be as high a percentage now. I presume the number of Irish speakers in the public service would be at least the same as in the population at large. Therefore, I presume it would be in the region of 5% to 8%. With new technology we will be able  to provide greatly enhanced services to the public and to deliver the basic level of service.With regard to the type of approach one could take, for example, there is a rule in terms of frontline services that a small number of people provide the majority of frontline services. In a major Department which has an information office, three people could man it on a full-time basis and a call from an Irish speaker anywhere in the country could be routed to that small pool of people. By using technology in this way quite a small reservoir of people can produce a significant improvement in the level of service.

The White Paper on Rural Development continues to be the Government's policy and the national development plan continues to be the vehicle for delivering the commitments it contains. I have provided detailed replies to questions on the White Paper in recent times, including one from Deputy Ferris on 2 November and a similar one today from Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.Last week the Government published the national spatial strategy. As I said then, this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt the Government's commitment to rural development and to the revitalising of rural areas.In relation to the CLÁR programme, as I indicated in reply to recent questions, the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis at NUI Maynooth has recently completed its analysis of the 2002 population census and my Department is examining the results in the context of the review of CLÁR areas.I am considering how a rural social economy programme, as referred to in the Agreed Programme for Government might best be established. The implementation of the county development strategies will be monitored by the task force on the integration of local government for local development on which my Department is represented. I intend to review the planning guidelines for small rural enterprises within the 12 months deadline as promised in the agreed programme. I intend to pursue with Teagasc the issue of developing the agricultural colleges as wider rural development resources.Responsibility for post offices rests with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In so far as I am concerned, I intend to co-fund on a 50-50 basis  with the Information Society Commission the cost of installing kiosks in 12 post offices in CLÁR areas to provide on-line access to Government information. This will enhance Government information channels for people living in rural areas.

What effects does he believe the cuts in programmes such as REPs, installation aid for young farmers and the early retirement scheme for farmers will have on efforts to create balanced rural community development? Does the Minister agree that the withdrawal of public services such as transport, post offices and schools will condemn an increasing number of rural communities to isolation and poverty? Will he agree that genuine rural development requires real democratic accountability and involvement of the communities and that unless this is implemented any effort at development and regeneration—

When I was in Opposition we asked questions, we did not read statements. I cannot agree with what the Deputy said and, unfortunately, in the time permitted I  cannot go into all the details. The Deputy mentioned various agricultural schemes. He should table a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food who would be able to tell him that there will be no cutback but rather an expansion in the money available for the farm improvement scheme next year and that there will be no cutback in REPs payments next year.In relation to my Department, I am confident that I can carry out a full programme under the CLÁR and Leader programmes next year and I will fulfil that remit. As the Deputy will be aware, a good deal of the work in my Department involves working with other Departments. For example, my Department was very involved in the spatial strategy. There is a clear statement in the strategy on the development of rural areas to the effect that they are not merely an adjunct of the towns. In Government one must lay the bunchlocha – the foundations – well, which we have done in the short time that this has been a full ministry.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The rural affairs allocation for 2003 is over €38 million. This includes Leader, the rural development measures in PEACE II and INTERREG III and the national development plan – rural development subhead, encompassing the Leader area based initiative, the farm relief services and the rural development fund. While the budgetary provision for Leader and the rural development measures in PEACE and INTERREG is lower by 4% from that of the 2002 rural development subhead, it is not anticipated that the programme cuts will have any significant negative impact over the lifetime of these programmes. These programmes are co-funded with the EU and will run to 2006, with the bulk of expenditure expected in the second half of the programmes, that is, 2004-06. I am satisfied that the 2003 allocations will be sufficient to meet the commitments under the cross-Border and the other rural development programmes.Although the provision for the CLÁR programme is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage to sustain an effective programme. The national institute for regional and spatial analysis at NUI, Maynooth, has recently completed its  analysis of the 2002 population census and my Department is considering the remits in the context of the review of CLÁR areas.The review of the Western Development Commission is ongoing and the reduction in the western development fund reflects projected actual expenditure this year. The decrease in the 2003 allocation will not in any way detract from either this Government's commitment or my own in ensuring that the problem of depopulation, decline and lack of services in rural areas is tackled.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I welcome the Minister's commitment that there will be sufficient funds for INTERREG and the PEACE programme in the future. In the past, however, programmes such as INTERREG and the PEACE programme have often been used as replacement funds for Government commitments rather than as additional funding, although it is additional funding under EU law. Will the Minister admit that a minus percentage, at a time when INTERREG is just being introduced, is a bad message to send?I welcomed the CLÁR programme when the Minister visited my parish of Aghabog. The Minister said previously and earlier today that the study being carried out at present will allow him to decide if there will be an increased number of areas in the programme. If that decision is made in January 2003, will the Minister have sufficient funds to make it a realistic programme for the additional areas as well as the existing areas?

We happen to be in that stage of the cycle so I do not anticipate any difficulties in that regard.Obviously I would like to have more money for CLÁR but in the current circumstances we have to be prudent with public finances. However, I am happy that, due to a number of factors, I will be able to complete a full programme in 2003. The main change of circumstances that has occurred since the summer has not been the reduction in the amount of money for CLÁR for 2003, but that the commitment to CLÁR will continue until 2006 during the lifetime of the Government. Until then, CLÁR was only a two year programme. Not only will I be able to expend money next year, some of which will be for programmes started this year, but I will be able to initiate programmes in 2003 that will continue through 2004 and 2005. As a result of the undertaking given in the programme for Government, it will be a multi-year strategy.I am also in negotiation with other Departments to ensure that the European Union money we spend under CLÁR is additional and that it continues to contribute its share of the money to these programmes. CLÁR was never meant to supplant existing funding; it was always meant to be additional and to lever out other funding from  other Departments. I am consulting the Departments in that regard at present.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Does the Minister accept that Border areas, in spite of the funding that has gone to them in recent years, have experienced the lowest increase in population according to the last census and that it is essential that the funding guaranteed from Brussels is drawn down? Can the Minister give an assurance that where funds are necessary, they will be provided as additional rather than replacement funds? It must be additional funding. I am not blaming this Minister because successive Governments did not ensure that this funding was additional. This is possibly the last tranche of EU funding and it is vital that it is delivered.

My experience in the past, whether it involved money for the Gaeltacht or for Border areas, was that there was a tendency in some of the agencies to pull back mainframe funding in those areas where money came out of a special fund. In fact, one of my main worries, and I have tried to build in guarantees, is to ensure that the funding in these programmes is additional. It was a particular concern when I was constructing CLÁR.

While less than might be hoped for, I believe that this is a reasonable achievement on the part of the Leader boards. There is emphasis in the programme on increasing the level of female representation and it is anticipated that a level of 30% female representation on the boards can be attained by the programme mid-term in 2003.Of the 12 board members of the Western Development Commission, four are women, giving a 33.3% representation.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	72	What steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure that the promise of 40% representation on the Leader boards will be fulfilled? Does he agree that the level of representation of women reflects an overall failure to provide adequate support for rural women in areas such as child care, transport and access to public meeting places and that the lack of such services in rural communities causes additional isolation for women? Does he further agree that this low level of participation is reflected in the general lack of control and power which is felt by communities and particularly women who are faced with academic, social and structural bar riers? This must be overcome if we are to move towards a society of equality.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The situation with regard to Leader boards is that there is great autonomy at local level. We lay down guidelines but each Leader board is elected and nominated by the social partners. I do not have any direct control in this matter. We are trying to fulfil many criteria but this year I tried to ensure that a minimum number of people on each Leader board was elected by the community sector. In addition, the various social interests appointed people to the boards. Nobody seeks to put only men or a majority of men on the boards but each group can ultimately create that effect as a result of each making an individual decision rather than co-ordinating its decision with others.The situation is different with the Western Development Commission in that the board is appointed by the Minister. Thirty three percent of the board members are women. We tried to fulfil a large number of criteria in appointing the board. We wanted representation from the seven western counties involved in the board as well as representation from the local authority sector, local authority management, industry and so forth. When all the criteria were considered, including ensuring there was adequate representation of women, it proved impossible to reach 40% in that case.

These include child care, transport, the availability of public meeting halls and so forth. This will advance the position of women towards a more equitable situation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Government is already spending a great deal of money on child care so it is dealing with that issue. I am not sure what the Deputy means with regard to access to halls. We are investing money in the provision of community and resource centres throughout the country. The lack of basic social facilities is a problem for both males and females in rural communities.The reason more women are not involved is more complex than stated. Some areas have a high representation of women in community activities while others have a lower one. My perception is that many more women are involved in the delegations which meet me than would have been the case heretofore.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity published in September 2000 recognised the need for a more modern legal framework for charities and stated the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fund-raising. The commitment to reform is restated in the programme for Government.My Department engaged consultants early this year to undertake an examination of aspects of charity law, including a review of the literature on the law and a study of the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions. This review was finalised in recent weeks and is being considered by my Department.Following consideration of that study I intend to commence work on the preparation of a consultation document which will serve to facilitate a public discussion on this important subject. The charity law review and the valuable work done in earlier reports will provide an important resource for this phase of the reform process. I am committed to consulting as widely as possible to ensure the production of legislation which will be both comprehensive and appropriate. The consultation document will be published at the earliest date consistent with a detailed consideration of the complex issues involved in reform.In addition to this public consultation process, the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity provides that the community and voluntary sector will be consulted on the legislation through the implementation and advisory group that was established by the Government to oversee implementation of the White Paper's recommendations.Proposals for legislative reform in regard to charities and charitable fund-raising will be brought forward as soon as possible following completion of the consultation process.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. Obviously there has been movement since the previous occasion on which he answered questions in the Dáil.Does the Minister of State envisage that the consultation document will be published in the first half of next year? What type of document does he think it will be? It is important that the document is not filled with jargon and is comprehensible to people with a vested interest in the area as regards the charities in which they are involved.The Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests do not have statutory powers to keep a register of charities. Will the Minister of State consider this work being commenced  immediately on a non-statutory basis so that, along with the consultation, we would have an idea of the overall number of charities in the country? We have seen high estimates but I am unaware of any definitive figure in this regard.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The consultants' report is being examined in the Department and I expect it to be published by summer. It is complex and we need time to examine it and work with interested groups. We want to make it as simple as possible and that is why, in addition to the public consultation phase, there will be consultation with the community and voluntary sector through the implementation and advisory group on the White Paper. We want to reach everyone and not just those directly involved.What the Deputy said about the commissioners and the current set-up is true. One of the results of proper legislation will be regulation and control. At present, the only form of registration is with the Revenue Commissioners. I am not sure about trying to expand the role of the commissioners at this stage. There have been so many false dawns in regard to doing something proper in this area that I am inclined to think it would be better to proceed with the public consultation and pass the legislation to deal with the area properly. I do not know if what exists at present can be built upon. I hope we can proceed to the public consultation phase by summer.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I presume the Minister of State is aware of the publication of a report by the Law Society on charity law reform. It is a comprehensive document which, I presume if the Minister of State or the Department had been aware of it earlier, might have done the job of a consultants' report and saved the Government a significant amount of money.Will the Government respond formally to the document? Does the Minister of State understand people's anxiety about the need for reform of charities legislation because of the uncertainty of ensuring in terms of bequests and ongoing donations, that the money is delivered to charitable organisations that are bona fide and is used for the purposes to which the donator feels it should be used?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Is the Minister of State satisfied there is sufficient control of charities? There are many of them and I have been led to believe some have been established in this country solely because there is no control and that this creates a chance for ripping people off. I have also been led to believe that young people are often used to raise funds that do not go in full or nearly in full to the charities specified.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I am aware of the Law Society report to which Deputy Boyle referred and have welcomed it. It is a useful contribution to the debate and I met representatives of the society some weeks ago to discuss it. The Law Reform  Commission has the area of charities legislation on its programme. Whether it manages to issue a report in time is another issue. All these reports are welcome and will form part of the general information in making decisions.There is anxiety about the lack of control. The only control is registration with the Revenue Commissioners. That is why we wish to engage in this process and implement proper legislation in the area. Charities have changed hugely but existing legislation is antiquated. It refers to collection buckets and such matters. Life has moved on and the area needs proper legislation.

Tá an soláthar sin ina fhianaise ar thiomantas leanúnach an Rialtais i leith bonneagar sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus sna hoileáin a fheabhsú.

Tá mé sásta go leanfar den chlár soláthair do bhonneagar na n-oileán agus do bhóithre Gaeltachta le linn 2003 mar chuid de chlár ilbhliantúil.Tá soláthar breise de thart ar €1 milliúin curtha ar fáil do na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialta chun tacaíochta níos mó don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chinntiú. Ina theannta sin, tá an soláthar don chiste Gaeilge méadaithe 8% agus do na hoileáin méadaithe 9%.Maidir leis an leithdháileadh laghdaithe d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá mé sásta go mbeidh an soláthar sin leordhóthanach ag cuimhneamh ar an éileamh ar dheontais thionsclaíocha nua a bhfuiltear ag súil leis. Tá plé le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta i ndáil le roghanna maoinithe nua dá chlár foirgníochta tar éis deiseanna nua a thabhairt chun solais a dhéanfar a shaothrú, lena n-áirítear gníomhaíochtaí a d'fhéadfadh ioncam a sholáthar.Sna cúinsí sin ar fad, tá mé lán-sásta go leanfar ar aghaidh an bhliain seo chugainn le clár suntas ach oibre ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge, leis an nGaeltacht agus leis na hoileáin agus go mbeidh Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Comhionannas), ach é a bheith achtaithe, ina chabhair mhór chun a chinntiú go rachfar ar aghaidh le bealaí praiticiúla a aimsiú chun caighdeán níos fearr a bhaint amach i ndáil le seirbhísí Stáit a sheachadadh trí don phobal.

Má cailltear maoineadh amháin, cailltear an maoineadh eile.Sa gcás seo, tá an chuid is mó den airgead ag dul ar Fhoras na Gaeilge. An coibhneas atá ansin ná 3:1. Tá an caillteanas réasúnta beag má thógtar ar an mbealach sin é. Tá coibhneas 3:1 ag baint leis an bhForas Ulster Scots, ach is mó airgid i bhfad atá ag dul an bealach eile – thart ar €400,000.

While €1.5 million was provided in the 2002 Estimates, the actual requirement is only €1.413 million. The reduction in the allocation to the Western Invest ment Fund simply reflects the projected actual expenditure.I met the chief executive officer on Wednesday, 27 November in relation to the matter and I remain satisfied as to the adequacy of the allocation.

Would he not agree that he has now cut it to its core particularly given that it took a number of years to get the commission operational? One of our key problems relates to the infrastructure in the west. In conjunction with the cutbacks on rural roads in the Department's budget, the cutback in the Western Development Fund, which gives confidence to the people in the west to develop under their own steam, is very savage.

This is not an infrastructure fund.With regard to the other issue the Deputy raised, the current position is that at the beginning of this year we provided more than €6 million in the Estimate. However, it emerged at my meeting with the chief executive of the Western Development Commission last week that it is unlikely that even €1.35 million will be spent this year. Given this small outturn compared to the level of money provided, it would have been foolish, particularly in a time of tight finances, to allocate money that would probably not be drawn down. I decided not to over-provide next year in light of the inability of the Western Investment Fund to draw down the current allocation. The reality is that the money drawn down is not determined by the amount of money I provide, but by the ability of the fund to find projects which will draw down the money in the calendar year.

However, I do not believe I will be proved wrong. I have no doubt that had I made this decision last year, there would have been the same hullabaloo and similar questions would have been asked about savage cutbacks when in reality it would have amounted to a good call on the likely draw down. I am completely satisfied that the money provided will be adequate for any likely drawdown to take place. In the event of the money drawn down exceeding what I have  provided in the Estimate, I will have to try to make up the difference within my Vote.

I understand the Minister's discussions were with the chief executive. What are the indications in relation to investment capital in the pipeline? Are there projects around or is the cupboard fairly bare? What precisely is the position going forward? I accept the Minister's point that there was a lack of take-up last year. However my concern is that momentum and motivation to take up this venture capital may be dampened in the context of what could be perceived to be a lack of ministerial support for this important venture capital fund, which the chairman says is one of the few sources of venture capital for the west.

I clarified to the chief executive that what we provide in the Estimates is the amount of money needed for drawing down because, as Members will appreciate, the State works on a cash basis from year to year. The provision in the Estimates will have no effect on the decisions to be made by the Western Development Board.Before being elected to office and since becoming a Minister my experience was and continues to be that considerable delays arise between projects being approved and drawing down of the money. When I take this and the number of projects currently approved into account, I would probably find that if I was to provide more money in the Estimate, it would become dead money because it would probably not be drawn down before the end of next year. I have to be a realist and provide budgets for likely outcomes not optical illusions.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Given the day and the circumstances in which the Fine Gael Party finds itself, I do not want to get involved in partisan, trench warfare. I am sure the Taoiseach will understand this. Last week's Supreme Court decision on the Electoral Act, which upheld an earlier High Court judgment, will have significant implications for every elected Member, every Member who intends seeking re-election and some of the unsuccessful candidates in the last general election. Does the Government intend to respond to the ruling? Is it the intention to introduce retrospective legislation? I hope the Government does not intend to use the decision as an excuse to raise spending limits for election campaigns.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	108	While I am aware of and understand the reasons for not dealing with notices of sympathy today, I express my sympathy to members of the Fine Gael Party on the death of their colleague. We will return to this matter next week.On the important issue raised by the Deputy, my understanding, as he will appreciate, is that the matter is being examined by the Attorney General and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. They will consider the implications of the judgments of the Supreme Court and the High Court in the case in question. In the short-term there is no question that one can change anything. We now have to comply with the decisions regardless of what happens in the future.The Standards in Public Office Commission will also examine the Supreme Court judgment. Ultimately, it will be for it to clarify requirements in terms of the completed election statements which are to be furnished to the commission on or before 20 December 2002. I have asked the  Attorney General and the Minister to have these matters examined forthwith and they have been examining them in recent days. There will also be a briefing session tomorrow for Deputies.The 20 December date will come very soon. While I am not certain at this point what we can do about this date, I understand we cannot do a great deal. We cannot move the date back as a Minister cannot introduce an amendment, instrument or declaration, not to speak of legislation, to do so. Unless I hear something to the contrary during the day, my current understanding of the position is that the date is written in stone. I could read the judgment in a particularly way. However, as Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny will appreciate, it affects not only individuals and constituencies, but political parties. While it can be interpreted broadly or narrowly, it is not our call to make an interpretation.The legal adviser to the Oireachtas is organising a briefing tomorrow for all Deputies. I will feed any information I get from the Minister or the Attorney General to the Government Chief Whip in order to help in this examination. In effect, we have only two weeks to deal with this issue. It is not in keeping with the belief of the political system, but that will not change it.We need to wait for the interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment. I would not dare to interpret it myself. An interpretation will provide completion. The last thing we need is for Members to go to their parties or constituencies to make changes and then find next year that they are engaged in a running battle. I will try to ascertain some degree of certainty on this as quickly as possible. I have asked that this be done tonight or tomorrow at the latest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. It appears that 20 December is an immovable date. It is a matter of great confusion because the Act clearly seems to be unworkable in real terms. The Taoiseach or a Minister would not be able to give a candidate a lift from one centre to another during an election because it might be deemed to add to his or her prestige. It might sway a voter to choose to vote for someone on the basis of a presumed endorsement from a high-ranking figure. The role of Ministers causes much confusion in the context of the Act. They are elected as Deputies but they still have all the trappings of power, as officers of Cabinet, be it back-up from Government service or the added value of free travel as it were.I appreciate that the Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General for clarification. I expect that he will come back with as clear a statement as possible so as to allow every Deputy to send in his or her electoral expenses before 20 December. I assume expenses already submitted were on the basis of the original Act. This was based on the assumption that the value of a constituency office and the assistance rendered by Oireachtas secretarial staff would not be deemed an electoral charge. The Supreme Court interpretation has  now ruled that it is. This is a matter of great concern to everybody. It is one of great confusion to the public, as well as intense anxiety to those who failed to be elected to this House by a shortfall of a few votes. Clarity all around is requested from the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I accept what has been stated by Deputy Kenny. This judgment raises an enormous number of issues. Needless to say, I hold the view that all Members of this House acted in good faith on the basis of the law as it was explained to them. Many people went to great lengths to find out exactly what the rules and regulations prescribed. The High Court and the Supreme Court have judged otherwise and that is the position. I know what the usual view is in regard to retrospective legislation. It is now 3 December and we are in breach of the law if we do not submit revised expenses by 20 December. I am not advocating that the decision be changed but the timescale appears to be a bit tight. However, it is a reality with which we have to deal.As Deputy Kenny said, somebody is left to interpret what this means down to the last detail. That is not clear in the Supreme Court decision. We have to get somebody to interpret it. Needless to say, I would be the last person to do that because whatever I would say would not be accepted. We have to try to get it interpreted as quickly as possible so that people have a chance of doing what is necessary.

Does he intend to take any steps to cause the Minister to apply himself to his own portfolio? I assume the Minister for Finance will not be able to relax tomorrow until after the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio show. Between "Morning Ireland", "Marian Finucane" and "Today with Pat Kenny", there will be a very good chance that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be on the radio to tell us all about the budget.A most foul murder was committed in Limerick at the weekend. A young husband and father of two was murdered because he apparently would not comply with gangsters and drug dealers. This is probably the most sinister—

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Does the Taoiseach agree that this is probably the most sinister killing since Veronica Guerin's murder? This came the day after the worst set of crime figures we have seen in recent times. For almost two years now the Garda surveillance helicopter has been lying idle at an airfield in Britain.It appears that the road traffic Act cannot be implemented due to lack of funding. Breathalyser kits have not been furnished to the Garda. Will the Taoiseach indicate if he intends to speak to his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is an expert on everybody's Department but who could well focus some time on his own?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I would like to think all my Ministers understand the rules of collective responsibility and thereby talk about more than their own area in support of Government policy. That is what they should be doing and that is what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing.All our sympathy goes to the family of the bereaved in the recent atrocity in Limerick. It is a tragic result of the behaviour and actions of those who operate in the gangland world. We have had many such executions by these people of law-abiding citizens. We have both the legislation and the resources to deal with these issues. It is not a matter of law or of resources, it is a matter of being able to crack these gangs. The special units of the Garda constantly endeavour to do that. A terrible tragedy such as this should not be necessary before people move in on these hardened criminals. The Garda has had success in Limerick and other cities in the past but this is a challenging area.It is intended to implement section 10 of the road traffic Act during the first half of next year. This is not due to a lack of resources but because of the number of challenges to this area of legislation. There are over 40 cases in the courts challenging the procedures in operation for breath testing. Until those cases are completed, kits will not be circulated to the fullest extent.Regarding the penalty points system, a manual system is in operation for speeding offences and it will soon be brought in for the non-wearing of safety belts and later for drink-driving. Section 10 will be implemented and hopefully it will have a positive effect. It is worth recording that the figures for the first month of increased activity by the Garda, on the decision of the Minister, has had a beneficial effect on the numbers of road deaths and injuries. However, we can never count only one month's figures. An effort must be made to implement the various measures taken on road safety in a forceful way, including in regard to drink driving, so that people drive diligently.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Is the Taoiseach saying it is the routine task of Ministers to discuss all aspects of Government policy? This is news to most of us. Does this mean the Minister for Transport will discuss the dangers of binge drinking? Will the Taoiseach have a word, for example, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he returns from his lecture tour about Operation Freeflow? Why do we have it for only one month of the year? Why, in a situation where people cannot get to work in the morning, can it  not be extended to 12 months of the year? Why can there not be a dedicated traffic corps? Why can the Taoiseach not talk to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about that? What is the difficulty posed? We have been talking about a dedicated traffic corps for a long time, yet it can be mustered for the month of December. Given that there is total gridlock in many parts of Dublin, would the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be best employed devoting his time to that?With regard to the situation in Limerick, would the same Minister not be best employed focusing on serious crime? It is alleged the top five drug barons in the city were sent to the United States for training in arms and a man diligently doing his duty to prevent these gangsters furnishing drugs in a nightclub was murdered on his way home from work. This is so serious that it requires the focus of the Minister. Is it not time, now that we have moved from a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to whom the workings of his Department were a mystery, to a Minister who is familiar with the mysteries of every Department except his own?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Defending and explaining Government policy is part of the duty of Ministers. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is well aware of the terrible act in Limerick and criminal activity involving drugs gangs, in particular. As Attorney General, he drafted tough legislation to deal with those issues. The legislation is in place to deal with breaking up drugs gangs but the lucrative business in which they are engaged drives them to undertake summary executions. That is a challenge for the Minister. The Minister, the Garda Commissioner and everybody else involved must do all they can to try to stop this activity in every way possible.Operation Freeflow commenced on 1 December and will run to 6 January in the greater Dublin area. It will attempt to assist in managing traffic congestion in the Dublin region and improve public transport. It is undertaken annually only in December because of the amount of resources required. An enormous number of gardaí and a great deal of effort is put in by the director of traffic attached to Dublin City Council, local authorities, transport service providers and the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Hickey. This operation is actively pursued and, hopefully, their work will help the free flow of traffic, as it has done every year.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Last Thursday night, RTE's "Prime Time" programme revealed an appalling glimpse of the shocking damage that the dangerous pattern of alcohol over-consumption is inflicting on individuals and our social life and the shocking drain on our emergency health services. Is the Taoiseach ashamed, having held the office for five and a half years, that his Government has presided over such a dramatic increase in the abuse of alcohol consumption as opposed to a  levelling off of consumption and the introduction of an educational process regarding sociable consumption?Does he believe it is criminal that the drinks industry should be allowed to portray and freely advertise its products in the national media as trendy, sexy, seductive and a virtual gateway to paradise for those who consume them while, as we saw on "Prime Time", the grim reality is that the industry's products finish up on the streets of our cities and towns as vomit, real and social, and our emergency services have the appalling task of coping with the after effects? Far from being a gateway to paradise for those who become permanently seduced by the products of the drinks industry, it is a gateway to hell on earth.When will the Government ban the advertising of alcohol as a trendy and healthy drug? Is the Taoiseach ashamed that he, his Ministers and his Tánaiste have been consistent enablers of the drinks industry by helping them to cast it in a favourable light, with the Tánaiste, for example, availing of a State aircraft in her eagerness to open an off-licence? Will they amend that policy and practice?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	118	A number of initiatives have been taken in this area by an interdepartmental group over the past number of years. Some have proved to be successful while others have not. I understand from the Minister for Health and Children that the code of practice for the drinks industry is not being complied with in the spirit that was intended. The Minister has announced he is examining the extension of the ban on advertising in certain areas and is seeking to ensure the drinks industry follows the standards that were set out previously. He has made a number of speeches on this recently.There is also a review group on intoxicating liquor licences and it is examining the issue of licensing discotheques, halls, clubs, bars, supermarkets and off-licences to see what can be done in that area. The Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science have taken initiatives and run campaigns to educate people who wish to drink, to engage in social drinking and to drink in moderation. These campaigns are aimed particularly at those who mix certain products with spirits, which creates enormous difficulties, as highlighted by the RTE programme and all the research in this area over the past number of years. Controls on such products should also be examined.The banning of a number of these products and efforts to take them out of circulation proved not to be legal. It is not possible to do so because many of these drinks are not in themselves harmful. However, when they are mixed with spirits, significant difficulties are created. The interdepartmental group, which covers all these issues, the reviews of liquor licensing and health and education issues, is continuing its work. The Minister for Health and Children has made clear his displeasure and unhappiness with the present  advertising legislation and has indicated he intends to amend it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	119	If a constituent of mine gets drunk and assaults somebody, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not express displeasure, as action is taken. Why is there such leniency towards the drinks industry when it is blatantly abusing its economic power to portray its products in this highly desirable fashion? Does the Taoiseach agree his Government facilitated the greed of these companies when it reduced corporation tax, even though the consumption of their products is a drain on our emergency services? Does he further agree that the drinks industry should be surtaxed so that more staff can be provided for our emergency services to cope with the dreadful after effects of what it has achieved through advertising? Will the Taoiseach join me in calling on the GAA and on soccer, rugby and all sporting organisations to cut their links with drinks companies and not facilitate them in pushing this product and creating even more damage? Would that not be a good beginning?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Minister for Health and Children has already made his displeasure known regarding the matters raised by the Deputy, including sports advertising. I am not sure if these methods will prove successful, because they have not to date. The Minister for Health and Children has research which shows that changing the laws on advertising and going beyond a voluntary code of practice would show effect. He argues that this has been shown in other areas and he will return to that issue. It is already his stated intention to move on the issue of advertising.As the Deputy correctly says, a large part of the work of accident and emergency departments, particularly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, centres on the effects of alcohol and drugs such as ecstasy and crack cocaine both in and outside licensed premises. A good beginning would be to remind people of their responsibilities and that it is illegal to serve under age drinkers in on-licence and off-licence premises. There are penalties for people who serve drink to people who are already under the influence of alcohol. It is for the publican to judge these things. At this time of the year publicans should take particular notice of these laws and not allow young people into licensed premises at any time of the day. This is already the law of the land.

Is this Bill the instrument that will be used to refurbish the 400 schools my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, raised and which were promised in advance of the general election by the Taoiseach and by his Ministers and backbenchers throughout the country, and for which promises we now find there was no basis?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Last Thursday a ruling was sought on the use of scripts in the House. Having considered the matter the position is as follows:Under a long standing ruling of the Chair dating from the 8th Dáil in the early 1930s "a Member is not entitled to read a speech but he may consult notes. A Minister, according to precedent, is allowed to read important statements of policy or fact and on this basis is allowed to circulate a script".That position is unchanged and while the rule has been applied in more recent years the Chair has taken the view that Members in consulting notes may do so from extended notes.The Committee on Procedure and Privileges touched on this matter when finalising the protocol on decorum in the House recently and the issue can be revisited if thought necessary.It is also important to point out that the Dáil itself saw the need for more spontaneity in debate by bringing in a new Standing Order 47 in 1996. The use of scripts runs contrary to the spirit of these changes and, ideally, should not be allowed. I realise the issue may not be straightforward for all Members and can be revisited by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if Members wish.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The purpose of the Bill is to establish a national development finance agency to assist in providing cost effective finance for priority infrastructure projects as an alternative to up-front Exchequer funding. It is proposed that the NDFA will discharge its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency and the aggregate funds it can borrow or guarantee cannot exceed €5 billion.When the agency was proposed by Fianna Fáil with much hype during the general election campaign a commentator in The Irish Times described it as a piece of fancy footwork by the Minister for Finance. However, in view of the Portuguese experience some of the finance involved will have to be seen as Exchequer borrowing, even where it is borrowed by private operators. The legislation cannot, therefore, be used by the Minister as an excuse for not having to borrow.The problem addressed by the Bill is that of project finance when the real problem is project management. This is evident in the huge over-runs with ongoing projects, be they roads, hospitals or schools. The Bill will not address this. The proposed new agency will be one more to add to the NRA, the NTMA and the recently announced Railway Procurement Agency. A plethora of agencies is now involved in borrowing money to finance major public infrastructure projects with little apparent interaction between them.Section 5 provides that the proposed agency may form special purpose companies or SPCs. This system is used by county councils. I am a member of one. They are not working well at county council level. There was a greater focus when various committees were established to examine specific projects but these have now been integrated into SPCs.SPCs will be able to borrow money for special projects, which will create another layer of bureaucracy How will it relate to the main agency? The National Treasury Management Agency could have established SPCs without the need to create a national development finance  agency. Perhaps the Bill could be amended to provide for this.Despite the criticism of the proposed agency, I hope it will encourage public private partnerships and that these will become more fashionable in the funding of health, education and roads projects. In the United Kingdom approximately 500 projects valued at €40 billion are under way using this system of financing. They include 100 hospitals and 70 schools.PPPs were first introduced three years ago and there are about 11 projects, most of which are for road building. Other types of projects are mostly pilot projects. The philosophy of PPPs has not yet taken off. I read in the newspapers recently that potential private sector consortia are now considering or threatening to abandon Ireland because of the so-called snail-like progress in the provision of infrastructure. My party had a billboard campaign about the Celtic snail about a year before the last general election and it was ridiculed effectively by a number of people. It may have been prophetic because that is what we have now. The roads are clogged up and there is traffic chaos and congestion across the country, even in small towns. The Civil Service system cannot cope with the demands placed upon it. As another commentator termed it the country is experiencing the slow snail syndrome.A number of Deputies referred to their own constituencies when speaking on this Bill. We have heard some fine contributions from both sides of the House including the contribution from the Minister of State about infrastructural deficits in the constituencies. I now have the opportunity to refer to the national spatial strategy and the census report which have become available since I made my last contribution last week.Two years ago Fine Gael employed consultants to draw up a party national spatial strategy. One of the growth centres identified as being suitable for future city status was Tralee. It is the ninth fastest growing centre of population in the country. The greater Tralee area has a population of 29,000 at present. It has grown in population by 10% since the 1996 census. The Fine Gael strategy document proposed that Tralee should be given the necessary infrastructure to enable further growth to be absorbed.Kerry County Council subsequently made a presentation to the Government suggesting that Tralee and Killarney should be included in the national spatial strategy as a linked gateway. When the strategy was announced last week, it recommended link gateways between Letterkenny and Derry and Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar – Dundalk and Sligo were to be separate gateways. It puzzles me why Tralee and Killarney were not considered as a linked gateway, as suggested by Kerry County Council.If one reads the literature accompanying the national spatial strategy it is obvious that the first priority will be the gateways outside Dublin, the main five being Cork, Limerick, Shannon, Gal way and Waterford. They will be prioritised for investment and population growth. The new gateways of Dundalk, Sligo, Letterkenny and the linked gateways of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar will be highly placed in the hierarchy. The hubs will be about third in priority and they are Cavan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Mallow, Wexford, Monaghan and Tuam. The linked hubs are Ballina and Castlebar and Tralee and Killarney.When the Taoiseach launched the strategy he said that all other Government policies must and will be consistent with the national spatial strategy whether in transport, health, education or housing. Government policy will be consistent with the priorities set out in the national spatial strategy. Investment will be put first in the major cities then into the new gateways, the linked gateways, the hubs and linked hubs. A county such as Kerry will be low on the priority list.The Minister, Deputy Cullen, stated that the national spatial strategy will inform and direct anyone making decisions regarding planning matters or spatial policy over the next 20 years. It will outline how and where to bring people, services and infrastructure together so that opportunities for investment are opened up across the country. Any investor coming into the country will study the spatial strategy and see the areas which the Government has highlighted and emphasised. Areas not touched by this strategy and not included on the map will not be prioritised.I come from the heart of north Kerry. It has no rail link and no national primary road. It was once a prosperous agricultural area. We have been marginalised and ignored. The only time I remember seeing any activity was before the last general election when the Taoiseach came down in November to open a road built by the NRA. A bevy of Ministers came and made promises and announcements which were never delivered. When community groups look for the money promised there is no record of any commitment made. We will probably not see any more Ministers until before the next election. The area north of Tralee up to Tarbert and the Limerick border is ignored. I am a representative who lives in the middle of that area. There is no hope for that area in the strategy and in Government policy. We must try to do it for ourselves. Without local employment there would be little or no employment in the area. Farming is in decline and there is nothing to take its place and this spatial strategy will not help.The Government rejected the idea of a gateway between Tralee and Killarney and decided on a hub. I was amazed that it did not put a linked hub in place between Killarney, Tralee and Listowel which would have linked Listowel into the focus of development in Kerry. The urban council and the chamber of commerce in that area are doing everything possible to bring investment into the town and are disappointed. I hope this Bill will provide for some spatial distribution of the projects. They should not be concentrated  solely around Dublin and the east coast. An effort should be made to place projects throughout the country. The Minister and his officials should encourage people to come forward with proposals for PPPs to ensure some kind of fair distribution and that the €5 billion should not all be concentrated in Dublin and on the east coast.

As Deputy Deenihan said, it was first mooted by the Minister for Finance prior to the last election. I am delighted he moved so quickly to bring the Bill before the House. It is complicated legislation but it is also innovative. There are three main advantages to the Bill. First, it will help Departments and local authorities to form an opinion on the need for, or the advisability of, getting finance for major infrastructural projects. Second, it can also advise Departments or, more importantly, local authorities on the best method to get the said finance. Third, because it has been given a budget of approximately €5 billion, it will be able, in some cases, to provide the finance.We are all aware there is a substantial infrastructural deficit and it is important we move as quickly as possible to correct that deficit. The normal process where a project is put out to tender following design, implemented and built can be time consuming. I look to this agency as a great method to speed up the delivery of infrastructural projects.I am particularly taken by section 5 which refers to the special purpose companies to which the previous speaker referred. I agree with him that we are bedevilled by various organisations going by their initials. In local government there are SPCs, but I think that refers more to special purpose committees. The special purpose companies to which this Bill refers are a method where the private sector can be brought in to help provide the expertise necessary to build infrastructural projects while at the same time – this is what I particularly like about the Bill – there is no State guarantee. Any benefits which accrue to the private company will be taken in the same way as in a normal, straightforward commercial venture.Public private partnerships are the way forward. Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending the opening of St. Attracta's community school in Tubbercurry in my constituency. This is one of the first occasions a PPP has been delivered in the Department of Education and Science. This new school is an amalgamation of two schools – the Marist convent in Tubbercurry and Beneda Abbey. There are approximately 570 students in the school with about 44 to 46 teachers. The time from its incept to the time it was handed over to the Department was exactly 13 months. That must be a record. At the end of the 13 months the students and staff have a superb school building – possibly the best in Europe, and I do not say that lightly. They have science laboratories, which are the envy of many third level establishments, lecture theatres, religious rooms, a per forming arts space, rooms for drama and music and woodwork and metal work facilities, which is appropriate given that Tubbercurry is the home of tool making in the north-west.If that project had gone through the normal procedure and the Department of Education and Science had invited tenders, etc., it would have taken five years to complete. The standard of equipment in the school is first class. More importantly, the company which has undertaken this project has also entered into an agreement with the Department of Education and Science, which will eventually own the school, that for the next 25 years, it will look after all the maintenance. At no time during the next 25 years will the principal or staff have to involve themselves in any way in the maintenance or looking for finance for it.The cost on the surface appears to be somewhat higher than normal but if this is looked at over 25 years, the students, who will go through the school during the next 25 years, and the staff will all agree it is money well spent. This process could not be compared with the normal process of procuring new schools. PPPs are definitely the way forward. To use them in conjunction with the special purpose companies referred to in the Bill will take an enormous risk from State funding. I also like the fact the chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency will be the chairman of the board of the national development finance agency. There should be a close link between both bodies. I commend the Bill to the House.

This Bill sets up another layer of bureaucracy or a quango. I have always opposed in principle the setting up of quangos. Once set up, they are inclined to remove elected personnel from the equation and, therefore, they are not subject to the same degree of political accountability, in particular, as is the case with bodies under Departments which are subject to departmental evaluation and can be brought before Oireachtas committees to account for various projects, overruns, time evaluations and matters of that nature.We should subject this Bill to particular scrutiny at this time when it appears there is financial difficulty, however surprising that may be. We do not know to where the largesse has disappeared but we are told on a daily basis that there is nothing left in the kitty.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	192	A lot of it has gone to the wealthy in reducing their capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. While looking after the well-heeled, it was brought in under the pretext that those people would release land and ensure that ordinary working class people would be the beneficiaries  by getting cheaper sites and getting houses. I did not see one couple or anybody else gaining as a result. Do not tell me it was reduced for the unfortunate people who lost everything they had in the Eircom privatisation. Although it has been reduced to nothing, it means nothing to those people who lost their few shillings savings. Many were elderly people who were left high and dry. Of course, the smart boys sold their shares quickly but the unfortunate poor people thought they could double a few bob – turn £3,000 into £6,000 in a short period – but nothing could be further from the truth. A lot of people gained much out of that.As someone who pays the higher rate of tax, I have never been afraid to say that I should pay a bit more tax to provide services for the elderly, the sick or the infirm. Maybe that is the socialist philosophy and maybe it is wrong to articulate it at this point and to articulate the values of Connolly and Larkin – the philosophy which underpins our party. They are the values to which I aspire. I hope that in years to come, when I am old and dependent, people will be prepared to contribute to provide services for me.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The Government has wielded the axe on all public expenditure. Over-administration has been one of the failings of our system. Why, therefore, does the Government feel it is necessary to establish a new agency to borrow money to ensure that the national development plan is put in place? Why not use the National Treasury Management Agency, to which Deputy Deenihan referred? It is an extremely capable body which has done a good job. Indeed it brought good news to the Minister for Finance the other day, saying the cost of borrowing was significantly lower than anticipated, which is good. It has made savings and is well placed to get the best borrowing conditions and everything else in relation to money.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, pooh-poohed our idea of reducing contributions to the pension fund. This is for future pensions, but of course the myth arose that we wanted to raid the current pension funds. There have been significant losses on the money that has been invested. We would be better off if that was utilised on some capital projects. I think the Minister of State would agree as he is an accountant who knows the value of these things.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	196	It is peculiar because it was seen as a bad idea when we suggested it. Part of the problem with Government nowadays is that no matter what suggestion comes from the Opposition, it is seen as ideologically driven and is per ceived to be bad. We thought this was a good idea at the time. It is a way of getting a positive rate of return over a period of time.The national development finance agency provided for in this Bill has its origins in the last general election campaign. The idea, basically, is to keep accounts off the balance sheet. It is off-balance sheet finance and the Minister for Finance, as a very proficient accountant, knows exactly what it is. I will not get into the nitty-gritty of it with him because he knows more about it than I do. It was obviously designed to allow the Minister for Finance to present himself as the great hero to the electorate. It offers a pretence that the Government is not actually borrowing at all.The European Commission has to examine this in the context of the stability pact and has some critical analysis to offer of the justification the Minister for Finance has tried to put over. I do not believe that justification any longer exists. Where in the spectrum is this national development finance agency going to lie? Is it going to be somewhere between the National Roads Authority, which looks after the provision of finance for roads, the National Treasury Management Agency or the Railway Procurement Agency, which deals with procurement necessary for development of the rail system? Finding space amongst all those agencies will be a very interesting task.There are obviously a number of issues of concern in relation to infrastructure. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is here because I know he is acutely aware of some of them. One of the things I have a particular concern about is investment in rail. It is a very important area for us all. Investment in rail is a very positive thing. I am a very strong supporter of investment in public transport. Over the years we have geared ourselves heavily for investment in public roads. This is necessary, but we have done so at the expense of the rail infrastructure. We are now trying to get back into some sort of shape but I think it will take us a significant number of years.Early bird systems from Mullingar to Dublin, etc. take people off the road, thereby contributing to an improved environment. The problem is that rolling stock and various other aspects of the service are not matching the demand of the general public. Rolling stock which breaks down or does not have heating systems, a working toilet, etc. generate an adverse public reaction. There are also not enough trains. Thankfully, more and more people will move to rail but we must have rolling stock that is fit for this century. I know a number of people from the Mullingar and Longford area who utilise the early bird service and certain things are critical to them. People getting up at 5.30 a.m. to catch the train at 6.30 a.m. to get to Dublin by 8.30 a.m. cannot afford any slip ups. This is no fault of workers in Iarnród Éireann who are working extremely hard. If rol ling stock is outdated or not up to scratch people are always working to try to catch up.It is important that money is made available to upgrade rolling stock to ensure the normal conveniences and comforts of the travelling public are provided for. People are prepared to a pay a price for this but we must make sure a quality service is provided. This means getting people to their jobs on time, providing proper heating systems and toilets and having no breakdowns. Rather than having big queues we should add extra carriages to accommodate people. Deputy Durkan knows that people at Maynooth station could fill one of the four or five-carriage trains on their own. By the time people get from Mullingar to Enfield the trains are at capacity and a lot of people have to stand, which greatly annoys them.We have heard about the 9% increase in Bus Éireann charges, but one young person rang me today about a 29% increase in the last eight months. We should be encouraging people to utilise public transport by making it efficient, cost-effective, comfortable and convenient in getting people from place to place. The environmental benefit of using public transport is enormous.My local council has made it a central core of our development plan to re-open all the old railway stations along the link. There is one at Killucan in Mullingar. I see Deputy McGrath coming in, he will support me 100% in this. He was at a meeting the other night about the railway service, and like myself he advocated the re-opening of the railway stations at Killucan and the Hill of Down, as well as the link between Athlone and Mullingar. This would facilitate a huge number of students who travel from Mullingar to the very fine institute of technology in Athlone. It would ensure that they would not have to have accommodation in Athlone and would be able to get back to Mullingar and the surrounding hinterlands of north and mid-west Meath. Again there would be a positive environmental impact, as well as tremendous savings for parents.We all welcomed the national spatial strategy. We in Mullingar were delighted to be accorded status along with Tullamore and Athlone, the important triangle of midland towns. This is a 20 year planning framework for the country aimed at achieving a better balance of structural, social and economic development between the regions and to encourage growth away from the east, particularly around Dublin, and back towards Mullingar, creating a critical mass necessary to attract development. It is important that the necessary financial resources are put in place to make this happen.Significant projects have been submitted to the Department seeking funding in respect of infrastructural deficits in sewerage and water facilities in Mullingar and Athlone. Unless the funding requested is made available to make these projects a reality, they will be aspirational. Funding is also required for the completion of the N52, an important link road, in respect of which Deputy McGrath has led a strong campaign. The IDA has  acquired land in Marlinstown. Westmeath County Council, of which Deputy McGrath and I are members, has been involved in the acquisition of this land. The completion of the N52 link road will be essential to ensure such development comes onstream. The N6, the western route through Kinnegad, and the N4 are important roads that traverse Mullingar.Deputy McGrath and I have spoken of the importance of ensuring work on the local hospital is completed. Phase 2B of the project spans five years and involves the provision and staffing of a 100 bed facility in respect of which nothing has happened. Are we prepared to invest the necessary resources? We must be prepared to provide adequate resources for the health area.For the national spatial strategy to be meaningful it is important to make sure it serves as a reference point for all investment in coming years. I am sure the Government will look favourably upon the application from Mullingar, which is a comprehensive one supported by the local authorities, the trade union movement and the relevant agencies.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	198	This is important in the context of the Bill, otherwise for what is this quango being created? It is supposed to access the money necessary to ensure these projects come onstream. I call on the Minister of State to make sure Mullingar is considered favourably in regard to decentralisation, otherwise the decentralisation proposal we have submitted, which is well supported across the county, will not follow the national spatial strategy. Excluding Mullingar would make a joke of it. That is an important point. If the strategy is to mean anything, it is abundantly clear that Departments and Government agencies must be decentralised to towns which have been designated as gateways or hubs. Mullingar is one of the few towns in the midlands where there has not been decentralisation to date. I hope the outcome for the town will be favourable.An objective of the Bill is to ensure the necessary finance will be provided for various projects. There is a deficit in the provision of resources for infrastructural projects. Nowhere is this more important than in schools building projects. The findings of a survey of building work on primary schools published in today's newspapers would make the hair stand on one's head. The guts of 400 schools are affected. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, referred to the elderly in relation to pensions and I accept his point. A decision to freeze primary school building projects is before the Department of Education and Science. Deputy McGrath is a teacher by profession and did a good job with many of us in his time. We were promised that the problems in this area would be solved before the general election.

He always gave me credit in the agricultural area. Some 14 or 15 schools in County Westmeath alone are substandard. We also have a promise regarding a school at tender stage in Coralstown. I am opposed, in principle, to what is proposed. We should borrow to provide the necessary resources and use the National Treasury Management Agency to do so. All the schools to which I referred are productive. They have produced a long line of students who have graduated from third level. Money should be allocated to the primary sector.We should borrow for productive purposes and not be afraid to do so. There would be a long-term return on such investment. It is important that we should examine this area in the round. There are tremendous infrastructural deficiencies across the country. We have a national development plan and, although I would have argued for different priorities, need a mechanism to put it into effect as quickly as possible. Creating a new quango will only gobble up the money allocated to the Department. It will not put tar on the roads, new rolling stock on the rail network or a roof on the educational buildings to which I  referred. This approach has bogged down infrastructural developments for decades to which we are just adding another layer. More of the same is what we can anticipate.

I expect her to arrive, but cannot say for definite that she will.This Bill effectively provides for a national borrowing agency. It is important to realise that we are speaking on the Bill with future generations in mind. In many cases the infrastructure being put in place will have to be repaired or even replaced sooner that it ought to be by future generations. One of the basic problems with public-private partnerships – the buzz phrase at the heart of the Bill – is that they encourage a lack of long-term thinking. The shareholders of the companies tendering for these public private partnerships want a return on their investment at the earliest opportunity. One way of doing this is to win tenders by providing the cheapest possible tender. This happens in public tendering also. However, in this case there is the pressure of shareholders trying to drive down the price to compete with each other in providing the cheapest possible tender.The Minister for Finance may consider this a welcome development in that he may be able to report on budget day that he managed to get a certain number of projects completed at a price that initially was cheaper. However, in the long-term the repairs to the projects in question and the failure of those projects will involve an additional unforeseen cost on the State in respect of which the taxpayer will once again have to pick up the tab. In this case, however, it is a more expensive tab because it involves built-in flaws in cheap structures which are not built for long life.I raised this matter recently in questions to the Taoiseach. The UK cannot report a good experience with public private partnerships. Naturally, companies try to tender as cheaply as possible but, in so doing, they have cut corners with the design and operational elements of the projects. This dates back to 1992 when the PPP principle became one of the main methods of building new public sector buildings. It involves transferring the risk of designing, building, financing and operating public projects to a private consortium  in a contract that typically lasts 30 years. The private consortium is paid a regular fee, according to how the service it provides performs.Public private partnership schemes are a costly form of hire purchase and are only necessary because of restrictive public borrowing rules. This issue is often brought to our attention when rules are being set in Brussels. Many people in this country will wonder what type of quality they can hope for in the case of hospitals. Public private partnerships have been used in the UK to provide hospitals. The experience there is not great. There have been long delays in building new hospitals. In fact, ten hospitals were announced in April 1998 but there are delays in nearly all of them at present. In every public private partnership built hospital, beds and jobs have been cut to generate income and profit. Cumberland Infirmary, for example, has reported the ceilings collapsing because of cheap plastic joints. The sewerage system cannot cope with demand and the operating theatres are flooded. Similar reports come from Dartford and Gravesham hospitals, which were described at their opening, like Tubbercurry school, as state of the art projects.Many hospitals and schools were built under the £43 billion public private partnership initiative, which is known in the UK as a private finance initiative. According to the British Labour Party's architecture expert, Sir Stuart Lipton, who is chairman of the commission for architecture and the built environment, they will be obsolete within a few years. He said that the British Government's desperation to deliver new public buildings was creating costly white elephants. He said, "The majority of PFI buildings are poorly designed and will fail to meet the changing demands of this and future generations".There is a risk in this country that the bad standards of building evident in Beaumont Hospital will be seen as a yardstick by public private partnership tendering companies. It was said on the radio this morning that 15 to 20 years is considered a building's lifespan after which serious repair costs arise. For that reason, there is a need to redefine the standards we will insist on if public private partnership projects are used to any great extent in future. I would prefer if they were not used.We are facing lower standards because that is what we have experienced with the buildings that are already in place. Contrast Beaumont Hospital, which is in need of serious roof and window repairs and is leaking, with the buildings housing this Parliament. The main part of Leinster House was built in 1744 and this Chamber dates back to the 19th century. Repairs have taken place over time but the standard of craftsmanship here is not the standard public private partnerships will deliver. That has been the experience in other countries as well as in Ireland.Last night on the news it was reported that Tubbercurry school was state-of-the-art.  However, I doubt that the Minister for Education and Science was giving the full picture when he said he believed it would be cheaper than if the State had built the school. How can he know? He is probably hoping that it will be cheaper but, having been a school principal, I know there will be unforeseen costs. If the job in hand is to be done by a private contractor, the contractor will seek the highest price possible. Although community employment schemes and other ways of providing staff in schools were inadequate, they are a far sight less costly than what a public private partnership firm will seek for work, since such firms will be anxious to maximise profits.Even if schools such as Tubbercurry are built to a high standard, where will we get the public or private funding to deal with the many other schools? Approximately 400 schools are in need of serious work but that work will not proceed under the process that was promised during the election campaign. Schools which are 100% reliant on prefabs, such as Scoil an Duinninigh in Kinsealy, north County Dublin, will wonder how they will benefit from public private partnerships. Schools that are too small cannot avail of computer provision because there is insufficient room to install the computers. That is the case at Hedgestown national school in Lusk. Where do public private partnerships fit into their situation?Many schools have toilets that are so damp that even cleaning them is difficult. That is the problem in Brackenstown in Swords. Then there are situations to which public private partnerships seem to have a simple response, schools facing such accommodation crises that to secure extra accommodation they are faced with the awful prospect of knocking down a protected building. That is something anybody would be reluctant to do and, hopefully, will not need to do. However, a gymnasium in a school in Ballincollig, County Cork, is to be knocked down without a second thought by a public private partnership company. The company concerned is Jarvis, which also built the school in Tubbercurry and has been involved in providing railway services in the UK. Unfortunately, however, it discovered it was unable to do that to a satisfactory standard. There have been a number of disastrous rail accidents in the UK.That is the worrying aspect of PPPs. Tendering for a project does not always mean the company with the best tender is the best company for the job. It may have the lowest price tag, but who is to say it has the expertise, tradition and standards which will meet the requirements in the area of railway infrastructure, for example? It is all too easy to be hoodwinked by the price tag involved in a tendering procedure. I hope we learn the lessons and do not repeat the awful tragedies of the United Kingdom when it comes to building our badly needed infrastructure. The rail infrastructure is one area where there is a need for enormous investment.I would look at schools in the United Kingdom to see where the public private partnership system has led the education system. Last week the  UK Department of Education called for an urgent report on chronically delayed public private partnership school improvement schemes which have been blamed by teachers for a slump in students passing examinations this year. Some 20 schools in Huddersfield and surrounding towns in west Yorkshire have seen severe disruption during the £59 million sterling partnership between the metropolitan district council and Jarvis. Projects due for completion in September are expected to run until Easter.There are a number of examples of public-private partnerships which have lessons to teach us. We should be open to learning these lessons, one of which may be that public private partnerships are not appropriate to all applications which have been tried in other countries. We may benefit from the fact that we have not gone down this road to the same extent.I would take stock when I see in the Bill that the National Development Finance Agency is to assist in providing cost-effective finance, that it will discharge its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency and that it will include experts with experience of corporate finance, risk assessment and delivery of major projects. Risk assessment, to date, has been appalling when one considers the flooding which has affected many parts of the country. Risk assessment, where housing and infrastructure generally are concerned, apparently does not take account of the degree to which flooding is increasing. I caution against leaving risk assessment to a body which is focused on the short-term returns for investment. If it is, corners will definitely be cut on projects in the hope risk assessment will not become too costly and flooding will not worsen during the years.I would also take stock when I hear the prediction by the largest world insurance companies that, where risk assessment and flooding are concerned, by 2065 there is a terrible chance that insurance claims as a result of climate change will outstrip world gross national product. I imagine that is not something many public private partnership companies would want to hear because they would want to make their investment quickly and get out. They do not want to think in the long-term if they can help it, especially if it is going to be more costly.Public private partnerships need to be re-examined. There is a temptation to say that, while we have experience in building roads with emigrants having built them in England for years, we do not have the same experience in building state-of-the-art railways such as Luas, which means we should engage a private company. This is seen as a selling point for public private partnership. However, the expertise needed to build Luas, for example, can be provided through public funding, capital investment from borrowing and a more prudent approach where the State retains the final say on how a project is to be developed and meet local needs. That is much more appropriate in the area  of public transport which is strategic and must be in place if business, life and communities are to survive.Another area where public private partnerships are wholly inappropriate is waste. The most lucrative projects in a public private partnership arrangement for a private company are the large ones, such as incinerators or engineered landfill. They are projects which not only have knock-on effects in terms of environmental problems but also have the effect of creating an out of sight, out of mind attitude among the public. The belief is that the problem can be dealt with in this fashion and will go away. Unfortunately, the issue of waste is not like that. It will not go away but will be transformed in a way which will affect people.We should take stock of our position and put in place policies which encourage local responsibility to the greatest extent possible rather than trying to hand the problem over to magicians who will try to make money rather than cast a magic spell. I caution strongly against public-private partnerships in forestry. If it is to be seen as a way of dealing with climate change, we need long-term planting, not the short-term rotation planting which public-private partnerships tend to encourage.For the reasons I have outlined, the Bill is not appropriate to the needs of the country. It encourages the Government to divest itself of its responsibilities which become those of people who want to make a short-term profit.

I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, has confirmed that we misinterpreted the promises made before the previous general election relating to schools and that they are to be delivered upon over five years, not in the immediate future.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	218	In my area Deputy Cassidy gave commitments towards Coralstown school which was listed on the departmental website as being approved to go to tender with 29 others. Some 30 primary schools were approved to go to tender last April. Only 17 have gone to tender and seven have commenced construction. It is a disgrace that such commitments were given and not fulfilled.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was the only realistic member of the previous Government. When he heard his colleagues making these commitments and promises, he knew he had to do something. Having discussed it with his gurus, he devised the National Development Finance Agency to source the money to build all the schools which were promised would be built.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The important thing was that the Minister, as an accountant, was concerned about having his books balanced. Tonight I am sure he is in the Department of Finance scratching around every possible corner because he wants to come here tomorrow and say he has lived up to the promises he made over the past five years. He has been trying to find pennies here and there and the savings bank will be robbed. Perhaps he will even go back to the social welfare fund and rob the workers of the country of the money they have saved up for the rainy day. He took €635 million from them this year and if he needs to balance the books again tomorrow, I am sure he will have another go.The Minister came up with this idea of a quango which is to be established to help him out in order that he can borrow money off the balance sheet. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, as an accountant, knows the constraints. This agency will allow a way to get around the requirements of the Maastricht treaty. The first four lines of the explanatory memorandum explain exactly the idea behind the Bill by stating:The purpose of this Bill is to establish a National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) to assist in providing [this is the important bit] cost effective finance for priority infrastructure projects as an alternative to up-front Exchequer funding or unsuitable private sector funding.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	221	It is a very prudent policy.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	222	It is a means of providing an alternative to up-front Exchequer funding. We have to get it off the balance sheet and this is how the Minister has decided it will be done.Something needs to be done because we have a huge infrastructural deficit. The national development plan is running way behind. Some 20 road projects have been shelved, many of which were mentioned by my constituency colleague, Deputy Penrose. Having read the national spatial strategy published in the last week and considering what is happening to the national development plan in terms of providing the infrastructure needed to implement the strategy, I wonder whether we are all living in cloud cuckoo land. When is this to happen? Is it the infrastructure or the national spatial strategy which comes first? I noted a paragraph in the strategy that stated regional development would  follow from the completion of the national development plan.There are some projects which this agency could look after rather than having them managed under the national development plan, including the N52 around Mullingar. We are awaiting a planned eastern bypass of the town, but it is another project that has been put on the high shelf. It looks like it will not happen for the moment and the congestion around the town will continue even though Mullingar is a gateway town that is supposed to develop.There are sewerage projects that are supposed to be undertaken under the national development plan. In Mullingar development has stopped because there is no more sewerage capacity and there is a problem in the centre of the town. No further development can happen until the sewerage problem is resolved. Will the National Development Finance Agency be able to provide the money to improve the sewerage infrastructure in Mullingar? I do not think it can and it is not suitable for this. Will it be used as an alternative way to get the finance for it?What about the proposed toll road, the N4, between Kilcock and Kinnegad, that was due to start in April, but has now been pushed back? Will it proceed by way of PPP or will it be financed by this new proposed agency? Is that to happen? Has the Minister changed his mind on this also? Toll roads will pose problems for certain sections of the community in parts of the country. Motorists will have to pay on a toll road from the midlands or the west to Dublin, but will be able to travel from other parts, for example Waterford, and not have to pay to get to the capital. Why should some sections of the country be penalised in this way when other sections will not? Is this fair? Surely other systems should be considered, including the idea of shadow tolling, which is successful in many places.What about funding for rail services? Deputy Penrose mentioned a very interesting meeting we had recently with some commuters who use the commuter line between Dublin and Mullingar. It is remarkable that Irish Rail invested about €50 million in upgrading the line between Mullingar and Dublin, but forgot to seek additional carriages. The line has been upgraded; we have continuous welded track and a new signalling system, while some of the platforms have been extended, but we will not have the carriages for another while. Old carriages are being used on new lines and we expect people to use it as a commuter service. This is totally unsatisfactory. If the Bill is to mean anything and result in improved infrastructure, we must look at those kinds of provisions and see what can be done.Four PPPs have been established for schools around the country. Will the National Development Finance Agency replace the need for such PPPs? On television last night we saw the magnificent job that had been done through such a partnership on the school in Tubbercurry. How much will be repaid by the State to the company  which put up the money for that project? What will be the total cost to the Exchequer over the protracted period of the contract? What would have been the cost to the Exchequer if the school had been built up-front and operated in the normal way? Was there a saving to the taxpayer? Will this not be the major criterion?The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states the functions of the agency will include:providing advice to State authorities, including Government Departments, to assist them [this is the important bit] in evaluating financial risks and costs and ensuring that they avail of the best financing package for each project.What risk was involved for the private company which built the four schools in question? Was the State likely to go bust? Was it not likely to get its money? Was the school likely to get wrecked or fall down? Where is the risk? Since there is no risk, what is the net return to the promoters on this project in terms of financial gain? If it was successful, why are other Departments not doing the same?It is interesting that the Bill is being introduced when we need infrastructure. Over the past three years I have been dealing with the Office of Public works in relation to a Garda station that I know particularly well because my father was the garda stationed there for years. It had become run down and there was a substantial piece of land in the centre of the village belonging to it. A local builder proposed taking over this land and building a house with a Garda station to the specification required by the Garda authorities. He was told this could not be done. That is the kind of project that should have been taken up. It would have happened very quickly and produced a very satisfactory arrangement in the end.However, the Office of Public Works decided to build the Garda station. It contracted the same builder to build it and divided the land. There is now a nice new small Garda station on half the site and a large plot of land behind it. I do not know what they intend to do with this or who will maintain it. It will probably be sold off and I am not sure they will get the same value for money or returns on it because the site is no longer as attractive or valuable since they took half it away. Whereas one could have had four, five or six town houses on the previous site, restrictions have been placed on what can be done. I wonder who was involved in making those decisions and why it was done in this way. Why did they not at least examine if the alternative was worthwhile? This is the kind of creative thinking we need to move forward.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. It is clear from the debate that this is an interesting Bill. It offers us an opportunity to give some thought to an issue discussed for some years in the House and at local authority level. The country has made great strides in recent years, moving from  being not very well off to being very prosperous. The national development plan, however, brought into focus the infrastructural development the State requires. Many people are disappointed that with our buoyancy, wealth and economic strength diminishing, this so badly needed infrastructure is still not in place. This brings us to the reason for introducing the Bill, namely, the search for ways to make cost-effective investments. I understand much of the Bill addresses this issue.Champagne corks were popped and there was a great deal of glee and celebration in some villages, towns and counties last week. My constituency is in a county that was not even mentioned in the national spatial strategy announced last Thursday. County Tipperary is the second biggest county in the country. The south Tipperary constituency contains the town with the largest inland population in the country.On reading the conditions for becoming a hub or gateway in the national spatial strategy, it soon became evident that not alone did Clonmel fit the bill, it exceeded the criteria. Without doubt, Clonmel's location gives it a better case for being included than many of the other towns which were included. The Minister will be aware of the towns I mean. They are those which were not expected to be included in the strategy. I was amazed and disappointed that County Tipperary was not even mentioned in the report. I have never witnessed such dejection and rejection on South Tipperary County Council among all members, including members of the parties on the other side, as I did at yesterday's council meeting.Having been passed over last week, the fear now concerns decentralisation, which is due to be announced in the coming weeks and months. I refer to the cases of Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir, two towns which have been lobbying for decentralisation for some considerable time. Tipperary, which is included in the RAPID programme, has been cited as the second poorest town in the country. This town once enjoyed considerable prosperity and had the densest milk producing area in Europe within a ten mile radius. This is a terrible position. At yesterday's meeting of our local authority people were aghast that we were not included in the national spatial strategy.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I am making a few points.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I want my message to be brought back to the Government. There is a great deal of merit in having an agency which considers spend ing. The reason I mention the national spatial strategy is that I want to know the reason infrastructure is considered for the county when it is not even considered in relation to future developments within the strategy.Some months ago I attended a meeting with the Minster for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in relation to the closure of the Limerick to Waterford railway line, a wonderful infrastructure. I am extremely concerned at the plans although I am aware the Minister directed CIE to postpone its plans until the publication of an imminent report. This railway line requires major investment. Its development would remove a significant amount of freight from our roads and assist in the transport of goods. There is major potential for the development of the line. While it would undoubtedly cost a large sum of money, the new agency would help to spend that money wisely.When I joined South Tipperary County Council in 1991, the possibility of building a bypass around Cashel was being discussed. The estimated cost at the time was €6 million to €7 million. At our last meeting we were informed that the cost could be as much as €40 million. The land has still not been bought, despite the fact that the bypass is so badly needed.The issue of flooding was raised earlier. Some four or five years ago the River Suir burst its banks causing huge problems for the people of Clonmel, particularly in the area of the old bridge. Commitments were given that investment would be made in the river banks, but this has not happened. The costs will have risen significantly since then. Perhaps some smaller works could be carried out. At a recent meeting an engineer told us that if it was his project he would do it at a tenth of the cost by just doing remedial works along the river banks and the bridges in the area.There appears to be a backlog of work in many areas. It would be helpful if the new agency could introduce a level of guidance in regard to such areas. When one goes to the Office of Public Works it says it is the job of the council while the council says it is the duty of the Office of Public Works. Can we find out whose job it is to do the remedial work and alleviate the problem of flooding? A similar situation exists in regard to schools.The development of villages cannot go ahead without sewerage schemes. Will this body make recommendations in this regard? We all know the villages in our constituencies that would benefit from these schemes being speeded up. It is important that we promote village development and that requires proper infrastructure.I may have wandered off the subject somewhat but I had a lot to get off my chest, particularly in regard to the spatial strategy. There is no point bringing in legislation and regulations if we are not going to stick to them and ensure they benefit everybody.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposed creation of the national  development finance agency. Like my party colleagues, I have a number of concerns in regard to the Bill. It creates another layer of bureaucracy. It is another quango of which we have enough as it is. I am particularly concerned that it will take on a life of its own and that it will not be controllable by the elected representatives. Instead of being accountable to this House this agency will become another door shut to democratic accountability.The aims of the Bill appear laudable. Some of the terms used in the explanatory memorandum and the introduction to the Bill were lost to the Government up to now. One such phrase is "cost-effective" and another is "priority infrastructure projects". We have not seen any real prioritisation in any Department in the past five and a half years. Nor have we seen any cost-effectiveness or value for money.The Bill does nothing to tackle the real issue at stake. An agency whose purpose is to raise money to finance projects under the national development plan ignores the mess in which the plan is currently. I welcome the fact that the national spatial strategy has finally been launched. Two and a half years ago when the national development plan was launched, I realised it was the wrong way around. It is sheer madness to launch a plan that spends money before there is a strategy in place. The national spatial strategy has been welcomed with fanfare in some areas and lamented in others. The launch of the national spatial strategy at this stage is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.The national development plan has been in operation for the past three years and this adds another layer to it. The Government is only now deciding on which areas to focus in regard to the national spatial strategy. Through the creation of the national development finance agency, it is trying to create a vehicle to raise finance to implement both the plan and the strategy, one of which has been in operation for three years. That is a most unusual way to go about things and it is hard to understand the logic underlying it.Previously, the biggest problem the Government faced was not the raising of finance but the choice of project, its design and operation, although that is no longer the position. My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated the case most effectively when he spoke on this Bill. Instead of addressing the waste in the whole process and endeavouring to get value for money, the Government has concentrated in the National Development Finance Agency Bill on generating money by any means available. This is a mistake we may come to regret.We all accept the huge problems created by the slow rate of delivery under the national development plan. It is a massive problem for the country and is having serious effects on every Department. Expectations were high when the national development plan was announced. It was greatly welcomed but its delivery has not been forth coming. Nobody is taking responsibility for that problem. Nobody in Government is putting up his or her hands saying mea culpa. It is the fault of somebody else. Someone has to accept responsibility for the lack of delivery on the national development plan. The main purpose of the Bill seems to be to make somebody else responsible and to have somebody else to blame.The scenario is akin to my experience of a year and a half ago as a county councillor. No elected representative could do anything about any issue under the national roads building project. It was out of our hands. It was very easy to say that nothing could be done, as it was the responsibility of the National Roads Authority and neither the local authority nor the Minister for the Environment and Local Government had any control over it. I am afraid that is the direction in which we are going with this Bill also. It allows people to say they would like to help but they cannot. It is a very easy political option and one in which any politician can see the attraction. The rightness of it is another issue altogether. We are elected to make hard decisions and we should have the courage to make them. This is an attempt to pass the buck and to do so as quickly as possible instead of a real attempt to deal with the situation.The Bill provides that State authorities are obliged to seek advice from the agency on the types and size of projects being developed. It is great that it can do so, but there is not much point in seeking the advice of experts if it is not going to be taken. There is no obligation on State authorities to take the advice given, a serious flaw that needs to be considered. Maybe there is a proposal to rectify this and make it mandatory but if that is not the case then it should be. If the Bill is to have any teeth then the national development finance agency must be allowed to comment on schemes emanating from Departments. It should be in a position to give advice on projects whether the advice is sought or not. If it is a pet project people do not always want advice.The Bill outlines who is disqualified from being on the board. This is an area with which I have great difficulty and it is a feature of much of the legislation that passes through the House. Among the categories of disqualified persons are those with a criminal conviction, those who have been bankrupt and so on. We are not told about the kind of people needed on the board or what type of background or qualifications they should have. We are appointing people to the board on a negative rather than a positive proposition. People coming to sit on such an important board should have clearly defined qualifications. I hope the Bill does not come into effect but the numbers suggest it will.Likewise, members will be appointed by the Minister of the day, but it is important that he or she should receive advice on those whom he or she proposes to appoint and that strict criteria are observed when making appointments in order that an individual with relevant experience is  appointed, not a friend of the Minister or a party member. We should be very strict about this.I welcome the aspiration to ensure gender balance on the board with regard being paid to "relevant experience". Relevant experience, however, is a requirement on the basis on gender balance, but not on other grounds. The Bill states, "as far as practicable there will be extra balance between men and women." However, when there are five people on the board, gender balance cannot be equitable, but it is important that it should be achieved.I hope when the Minister makes the appointments, he does not adopt a similar attitude to the Minster for the Environment and Local Government, who appeared on "Questions and Answers" last night, regarding women's participation in society, with which I take grave issue. When referring to membership of golf clubs, he cited one club as an example saying he did not think many women could afford the membership fee anyway. The Government should take note of such a comment and ensure gender balance in all legislation and when making all appointments in order that women are in the same position as men when applying to join any club or organisation. Financial restrictions should be fair and not differ between men and women.I have not closed my mind to public private partnerships in general because that would be wrong. There are circumstances in which they could work effectively, but the decisions on which projects are selected are vital. We have limited experience in Ireland in this area and need to learn from the experience of others. The Bill does not address the project selection process and I wonder who will assess what projects are suitable for PPP. It is easy to discuss PPP now in tougher budgetary times.Previous speakers referred to the new school project in Tubbercurry which has been welcomed as a fantastic facility because principals and staff have been freed to teach. However, we do not have experience in this area. A company will take over the building of the school as well as providing for maintenance, cleaning and IT support. Significant problems have been experienced in the United Kingdom in regard to PPPs and in similar projects there school life has been disrupted and standards have been affected while, in some cases, the work has been shoddy.I am concerned that we should not put ourselves in the same position with standards slipping in a few years. It is easy to open a fine, new school today, but what it will be like tomorrow is another question. The Tubbercurry school has provided a positive experience, but it is early days. However, the contract is strong and the company will not be paid unless its work meets the necessary requirements. The school was built on time, is a top class facility and provides all the equipment and space the students need. It is great to say this about Tubbercurry school, but the Minister should ask himself whether it should not  be the case with every school on the day it opens. Does the Minister of State accept the Department of Education and Science is not providing such facilities and that the Minister must turn to PPPs because he is not able to ensure his Department can carry out the work to the required standards? If a private company can deliver a project on time, Departments should have the resources in place to ensure it can do likewise.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank Members who have contributed to the debate and was impressed by how well informed were some of the contributions. I hope it has proved informative for those who are following the debate outside the House. As the Minister for Finance stated last week, the Bill is an important part of the Government's plans to address the country's infrastructural deficit. When enacted, it will establish a national development finance agency which will endeavour to maximise value for money for the Exchequer in a number of ways, including through the identification of optimal financing packages and the application of commercial standards to the evaluation of financial risks and costs for each project.While the NDFA will add an important dimension of financing advice and expertise to existing arrangements for developing infrastructure, it will not substitute or replace those arrangements. In keeping with normal democratic arrangements the Government will have overall responsibility for deciding social and economic issues and priorities. The responsibility for initiating projects, including PPPs, determining which projects will be prioritised and for individual project management will remain with the relevant Minister and PPP units created in particular sectors such as national roads or rail.The PPP unit in the Department of Finance has responsibility for leading, driving and co-ordinating PPPs. Experts from the central unit have made significant contributions to developing the early pilot projects, stimulating a competitive market for PPPs and agreeing a framework for PPPs with the social partners. The PPP market has been developed from having no projects in place a mere two years ago to upwards of 40 projects at various stages of procurement currently.The primary role of the Department of Finance's PPP unit is the creation of a comprehensive body of guidance on all aspects of PPPs covering financial, legal, technical, human resources and process issues. This guidance will set the context within which the NDFA will function. The agency will provide expert financial advice and, in some circumstances, may provide finance. It will underpin and augment existing arrangements and not replace, supersede or duplicate them, nor will it add another layer of bureaucracy.Deputy Sargent criticised the private finance initiative in the United Kingdom. I agree there  were significant shortcomings in early PFI projects. Costs were high and, in some cases, quality was questionable, but the Government's programme is not a PFI and this is not the United Kingdom. We are implementing a pilot programme of PPP projects to build on experience of project implementation in Ireland, learn from best practice internationally, not only the United Kingdom, and ensure we achieve more effective, efficient and economical PPP projects. Many international experts have commented favourably on the progress made to date.Regarding Deputy Deenihan's point on improving project management, the new agency will be available to provide financial advice for the relevant State authority throughout the procurement of projects. Moreover, there is an in-built tendency in PPP projects towards better project management because the risks in respect of project costs and the duration of the design and build phase are fixed in a contract clause.Deputies Deenihan and Penrose raised questions regarding the NDFA's powers to create special purpose companies. These arrangements were carefully designed to ensure there would be no uncertainty about the statutory authority to discharge these functions, best practice could be applied in regard to governance and accountability of the agency and there would be a necessary differentiation between the NTMA core responsibility and the new functions of the NDFA in respect of the special purpose committees.In response to Deputy Deenihan's other questions on PPPs, there has been considerable progress in bringing major projects to the market. In mid-2000 there were no projects whereas now up to 40 projects are at various stages of procurement and the construction of the bundles of five proposed primary schools is almost complete. The Tubbercurry school, as Members pointed out, was officially opened yesterday. CONNEX has been appointed as operator of the first Luas line under the programme and construction of the second West Link bridge is in progress.Deputy McGrath asked whether the agency would provide finance for existing projects such as the Kilcock-Kinnegad road project or rail projects as well as future infrastructural projects. The Minister hopes to have the agency up and running early next year. However, none of the priority infrastructural projects, whether PPP or otherwise, will be delayed. If the NDFA can make a contribution to the delivery of existing projects, this will be done, but it is not intended to replace existing funding arrangements with NDFA finance in the short-term. The agency will examine whether it should become involved in refinancing PPP projects in the future. Added to these projects are PPPs in water services, education, health – as recently announced by the Minister for Health and Children – while it is intended that the Dublin metro will be procured by means of a PPP approach.In the last year or so the Government has brought forward the State authorities PPP  arrangement pact. A framework for PPP has been agreed with the social partners under the PPF and new structures for delivering public-private partnerships have been put in place. The progress we have made with the public-private partnership companies compares favourably with any other country. The NDFA should achieve significant savings on project costs through negotiating optimal financing packages and reducing consultancy fees.Deputy Richard Bruton and others raised the need to address infrastructural requirements. I fully agree that this country has many infrastructural needs and we are facing significant pressures in this area. It is vitally important that these infrastructural needs are addressed as a matter of urgency and in a way that delivers value for money. It is for this very reason that the NDFA proposal has been developed. The Minister for Finance wrote to the chief executive of the NTMA earlier this year about proposals to tackle our infrastructural needs. At the same time he asked his officials to examine practice in other countries that have used alternative financing mechanisms for major infrastructural projects, such as France and Portugal. The experience gained from the early pilot PPP projects indicated that Departments and State authorities needed specific expert advice to assist them in identifying the optimal finance packages for their projects.The outcome of these deliberations is a proposal to establish the NDFA. It is precisely because the Government is determined to ensure our infrastructural needs are met and the future development of our economy secured that the proposal has been brought forward and dealt with as a matter of priority. The NDFA will help State authorities such as Departments to make the best use of their funding by identifying optimal finance packages for projects, whether this is provided directly by the Exchequer, the EIB, the NDFA or the private sector or some combination of these.Regarding Deputy Deenihan's question about the national spatial strategy and the Tralee, Killarney, Listowel corridor, the appropriate State agency or procuring authority is responsible for bringing forward projects under its areas of responsibility. The NDFA will provide financial advice on whatever projects are brought forward. However, it will not have a role in deciding on any particular location for the projects.Deputies Burton, Joe Higgins and others asked the reason the NTMA does not simply take on the task being allocated to the NDFA rather than set up a new body. Great care has been taken in designing these arrangements to ensure best practice has been followed in relation to the structures, staffing and governance arrangements for the NDFA. The skills and corporate structures required to undertake this important task are of a somewhat different nature from those available within the NTMA. The financing of infrastructural projects requires specific borrowing vehicles and corporate finance skills in  order to access capital at the optimal cost. The skills within NTMA will complement those within the NDFA. Staffing arrangements are also intended to avoid unnecessary or wasteful duplication of scarce talent and ability by allowing the NDFA to draw on the reservoir of skills and capabilities already available in the NTMA. Moreover, the governance arrangements for the chairman, board and separate chief executive officer in the NDFA should ensure the necessary differentiation between the different statutory functions of the NTMA and the NDFA is preserved.Deputy Joe Higgins raised the matter of the provisions of sections 18(7)(a) and 18(7)(b), which restrict the chief executive officer and the chairperson from questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits or objectives of any policy of the Government, a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General, or from producing or sending to a committee documents which question or express an opinion on the merits of any such policy or such objectives. These provisions are a standard part of similar legislation enacted since 1998. For example, the provisions are contained in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the Ordnance Survey (Ireland) Act, 2001 and the Competition Act, 2002, among others.Deputies Richard Bruton, Joe Higgins and others raised the matter of who sets policies and priorities. This relates to ownership of projects. It is important to note that while the proposed legislation provides, in section 8, that State authorities will be advised to seek NDFA advice, the final decision on the structure and financing of a project remains a matter for the appropriate Minister or, where there is delegate sanction, the appropriate Accounting Officer or equivalent. It will be a matter for Ministers and Departments, as is already the case, to bring forward projects for approval and prioritisation. The role of the NDFA will be to advise on the optimal financing of these projects. In fulfilling this role the NDFA will faciliate infrastructure, not impede it. It will work with the State authorities to provide the best means of financing projects.Deputies Richard Bruton, Burton, Joe Higgins and others raised the matter of the guidelines on State authorities seeking advice from the NDFA. The legislation provides, in section 8, that the Minister for Finance will issue guidance on the circumstances in which NDFA advice should be sought, taking account of the type of project, programme or project, the state of development of a project and any other relevant factors. The reason this guidance has not been prepared and published in advance is straightforward. The NDFA has not been set up yet and full guidance simply could not be provided in a vacuum. The guidance will be quite detailed and specific, dealing with cases as they arise. It will be drafted with input from a cross-departmental team which will include a representative of the Office of the  Attorney General in an advisory rather than executive capacity and the NDFA.Several Deputies asked how the NDFA will maximise value for money for the Exchequer. The NDFA will do this by identifying the best financing packages and applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project. In addition, where it is able to borrow at better rates than the private sector, taking account of the degree of risk transfer, less State subvention may be required for capital projects.Deputies Burton, Richard Bruton and others asked who will decide on the financial reporting of projects and if NDFA financing may affect the general government balance. The financing and the financial reporting of all projects, including those involving the NDFA, rests with the relevant EU body, EUROSTAT, which will decide on a case by case basis. The general government balance, GGB, is an EU measure of State finance which includes any non-Exchequer financing which the State or State organisation discharges. It is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of the Maastricht treaty. The impact of the NDFA financing on the GGB will depend on the nature of the projects being financed and, ultimately, rulings by EUROSTAT.Deputies Burton, Richard Bruton and others suggested that one of the purposes of the NDFA was to finance infrastructural projects off balance sheet. This is not the case. The purpose of the new agency is to deliver value for money for the Exchequer by facilitating the best financial arrangements for projects. It will advise sponsoring agencies such as Departments, local authorities or statutory bodies on the optimal means of financing major infrastructural projects. It will provide ongoing financial advice as projects are procured and, in certain circumstances, will raise finance for projects. This, in turn, will assist in the delivery of key elements of the national development plan and other infrastructural priorities. The financial reporting arrangements for projects financed by the NDFA or through the special purpose companies will be the same as for other PPP type projects. The agency cannot and will not bring projects off the balance sheet of the public sector unless the main determinants of the categorisation of projects such as risk transfer and the presence of revenue streams from user charges are also present.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The decision by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to agree to the reduction of a further 5,000 places in the community employment schemes is heartless and unsympathetic. It is a clear indication that she is out of touch with the tremendous work that has been carried out in every community by people who are disabled, lone parents or the unemployed and who are unlikely to be gainfully employed in the open market. The schemes have made an enormous contribution to the self-esteem of the participants.The Tánaiste is clearly demonstrating that she is out of touch with reality and out of touch with the communities in question. She does not wish to recognise or acknowledge the deep concern about the future of these schemes, or the tremendous work that has been carried out in the past on behalf of community, sporting and various other organisations in each parish around the country.The Government has indicated that it wishes to invest in measures that have a primary focus on employability and, in deciding on the 2003 allocation in the Estimates for FÁS, it states that it was conscious of the need to maximise measures that would emphasise employment, training and opportunities. This is politically hypocritical when one considers the €35 million reduction in enterprise provision, arising from cuts in the budget of organisations such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and county development boards. This shows that the decision of the Tánaiste has nothing whatsoever to do with measures to increase employment or training, but has everything to do with mere budgetary arithmetic.The Tánaiste has deliberately reduced the budget of community employment schemes in order to balance the books. She has identified vulnerable groups in community, sporting and disability organisations as soft targets to find savings. It must be remembered that these savings are the direct result of the failure of the Tánaiste, the Progressive Democrats and the Minster for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to keep tight control on public expenditure over the past two years. The failure to keep expenditure under control is now leading to savings having to be made in vulnerable community, sporting and other organisations.The people that are suffering from the irresponsibility of over-expenditure have made a major contribution to neighbourhoods, communities and activities that would not have been carried out were it not for the financial support of  FÁS through the various schemes. Of course, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs equally sold out on community, voluntary and local development schemes when he accepted a major cut in his Estimates for 2003. My colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, will be detailing the damage that will be done to those schemes in 2003 when he addresses this motion.The Government has stated the reason that it is reducing the CE schemes is to recognise the significant reduction in the numbers of unemployed. This may have been the case up to the end of 2001, but it is certainly not the case in 2002. The numbers of unemployed have increased from 141,503 in October 2001 to 157,665 in October 2002. Additionally, the Tánaiste has expressed a willingness to allow a considerable number of immigrants into this country through the work permit scheme, which will put even greater pressure on the people who wish to gain employment in the open market.The Tánaiste has also made great political play of the money that is being made available for the social economy programme. This is a completely different scheme which requires the sale of produce as part of the fulfilment of the criteria and has nothing whatsoever to do with community development for voluntary organisations throughout the country.Let me give a few examples of how the decisions for which the Tánaiste is responsible are having an impact at community level. I received a letter from Kells Regional, Economic and Tourism Enterprise Ltd. in County Kilkenny. It has had as many as 20 participants at one stage and an average of 15 in recent years. Now there are only ten participants to cater for Kells and Stoneyford. The organisation has been involved in work improving the round tower, the mill, the high cross and many other historical sites which are visited daily by tourists from all over the world. I am told that its Sculpture at Kells exhibition is now a major international exhibition, which attracts thousands of visitors to the area annually and also allows local and national artists to exhibit and sell their work in a most unique setting. With ten participants on the scheme at the moment, the enterprise is under enough pressure, but what the Government is proposing to do is reduce this number further. This is a cause for worry. Kells is one of the communities that has benefited enormously from the scheme and it is stating to me and other public representatives that it wants to retain the scheme to ensure the developments that have taken place continue. They could only take place because of funding from the FÁS programme.A single person on a CE scheme earns €143.20. A single person on social welfare earns €118.80, so the extra cost per participant on a CE scheme is €24.40. That is an extra cost of €1.25 per hour to the State to employ a participant. Is it better to employ someone at an extra cost of €1.25 per hour to do worthwhile community work or should  he be paid social welfare to do nothing? Also, each scheme gets an allowance of €15.24 per participant for the purchase of materials that are necessary to the successful running of the project. As well as boosting the local economy, half of this fund is returned to the Exchequer in the form of VAT. Depending on their status, some participants pay income tax while others, supervisors for example, also pay PRSI. Therefore, it makes no sense for a party like the Progressive Democrats, which I though was in favour of community enterprise, to look at a scheme like this in a very arbitrary way and abolish it although it is responsible for training and employing people gainfully rather than having such people opt for the inertia of individuals on the dole.I came across another group recently in Inistiogue in County Kilkenny which was recently presented, to a fanfare of publicity, with a national award from FÁS because of their great work in community and environmental development in that lovely village. About 25 people who were participating on the CE scheme in the past year or two will see this number reduced to just ten or maybe less, all because of this arbitrary reduction of 5,000 nationally. We are prepared to give a group a national award and punish it for winning by reducing the number of places on the community employment schemes.Castlecomer, in north County Kilkenny, had 30 people involved in a community employment scheme doing a range of activities in the area. The number on the scheme is to be reduced to 18 or less in 2003. The town has been the recipient of very bad news recently because of the loss of 160 jobs in the local textile factory, Comerama. They have been the recipient of bad news recently with the loss of 160 jobs in their textile factory. This scheme will be reduced to 18 participants in 2003 and the numbers involved may be even further reduced. These examples are replicated around the country. Other speakers will give further illustrations of the damage to the morale and confidence of the participants and communities who have been involved in these important schemes.The continuation of community employment schemes at the 2002 levels of availability is vitally important to allow everyone the opportunity to work. Fine Gael is in favour of giving people the opportunity to work and we have resisted the attempts in the past, in Government and Opposition, to act otherwise so as to ensure that this principle is enshrined in our philosophy. The deterioration in the economy and rising levels of unemployment will mean that those displaced from these schemes will not easily gain work on the open market. It is essential to continue training and employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed and those with disabilities who otherwise would not have access to them.The viability of the projects and activities of every community group are now dependent on the participation of people in community employment schemes. Almost every community hall, parish hall, sporting organisation and health care  facility in every parish is depending on the part-time employment of local people through the FÁS funded schemes. I and my party acknowledges the great work done by the many community groups throughout the country with the assistance of these schemes.We on this side of the House are committed to maintaining the participation of these schemes at 2002 levels. That recognises the financial position in the country, which has changed since the general election. Many small towns and villages are totally dependent on these schemes.The way times have changed since the general election, when there was no problem with these schemes, nor with the amount of money available to them, is reflected in an article today in a national newspaper detailing the number of schools that will no longer receive funding for refurbishment. During the general election campaign the Minister and the then Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, engaged in ridiculous squabbling over the future of these schemes. Deputy Kitt gave a guarantee that no community employment scheme place would be lost. On the "Liveline" radio programme on 15 May 2002, two days before the election, he said he was acting on the direction of the Taoiseach, a very honest man. He went on to say his party had not been consulted on the issue of the schemes and that it would insist that they continue. However, the Minister said the restructuring of the schemes and the reduction in the number of participants was a Cabinet decision. Deputy Kitt said there were ideological differences between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on this issue but these comments were dismissed as electioneering by Progressive Democrats sources.The Minister now has the opportunity to set the record straight regarding her bona fides before and since the general election. Her action today does not give me confidence that she will acknowledge the work done by participants in these schemes and the different economic climate in terms of job opportunities and participation. The motion gives Government politicians the opportunity to put up or shut up. They are speaking from both sides of their mouths on a very important issue for their local communities by telling them they will be looked after, yet when difficulties arise they will be told that FÁS is unable to meet the demand by community groups to maintain these schemes. The vote on this motion will give Government Deputies the opportunity to maintain the number of participants in these schemes at 2002 levels. Otherwise they should tell their constituents that they have failed to convince the Minister, who is out of touch with community groups, is unaware of the importance of these scheme and is bent on maintaining the budgetary arithmetic rather than the important social and economic contribution made by the schemes to many communities.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Community employment schemes have made a huge contribution to people's lives  over a wide range of services, including health, education and the environment. The Minister claims that many of the services provided by the schemes in the educational sector have been mainstreamed into the education budget. This budget has been transferred from FÁS to the Department of Education and Science and while a semblance of a service is provided, the new system is not as effective or as flexible when it was administered by community groups working in co-operation with the schools. Similarly, the mainstreaming of community employment schemes into health and child care services is also unsatisfactory. The money to be transferred from FÁS will be lost in these underfunded services.The Minister rightly argues that retraining for full-time employment should be the primary concern and objective of the community employment schemes. This should continue to be the main focus, especially for younger participants. However, regardless of whether the Minister acknowledges it, a substantial number of current and former participants will find it impossible to secure positions in mainstream employment. Between January and October this year, 19,000 people left community employment schemes, of which almost 4,000 were over 50 years of age, almost 3,000 had a disability, almost 6,000 were lone parents and 600 were widowed. The vast majority of people in these categories have returned to the live register. Social difficulties and unique family circumstances are contributing to this, but a major problem in rural towns and villages is that very few jobs are available. There may be some employment opportunities in the bigger centres but with no public transport and no way of buying a car or affording insurance, many of these people are condemned to a lifetime of unemployment.At present increasing numbers of appeals and reallocations for unemployment assistance are being made by people in rural areas. Those in small towns and villages who are barred from participating in community employment schemes cannot find work locally, are unable to travel to work and are being refused unemployment assistance. They would be only too willing to participate in a community employment scheme that would give them the dignity of a job and provide their neighbours and communities with invaluable support and services.There may be a need to establish a social employment scheme in conjunction with community employment schemes which would be more suitable for the participants and the communities they serve. I understand that FÁS has been undertaking a review of this area. At our meetings with FÁS we have advocated this dual approach. Community employment schemes should continue with an emphasis on the training aspect while a type of social employment scheme should be developed which would be more employment orientated. We hope the Minister will encourage this approach as it would be helpful in the current economic climate. A transfer  of resources from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS would finance up to 80% of such schemes.The Minister has not addressed the work done by participants in community employment schemes in environmental projects, including town and village renewal programmes, tidy town projects and the upkeep of sport and leisure facilities. Over the past ten years enormous funding was provided to community councils to develop badly needed facilities and great work was done. Exceptional value for money was achieved. However, many of these projects are at risk because of the demise of the community employment schemes. Much voluntary work is still necessary but because, increasingly, two members of households now work it is more difficult for them to give time to voluntary organisations. They need the back-up of community employment schemes to ensure that these projects survive. Local authority funding is going to be scarcer over the next number of years and there will be no discretionary funding available. Local authorities are broke. If the Minister does not act, millions of euro worth of projects will be put at risk. If the will is there the problem can be solved. There are people who are willing and ready to do the work. Most of the funding required can be secured by transferring resources from one Department to another. There are very anxious voluntary groups awaiting the Minister's decision in the hope that they can continue their valuable work for their communities and for society.

She made a terrible decision on 1 April 2000 when she decided to cap the CE schemes at three years and irrespective of what is decided now they will be coming to an end anyway. It appears to me that, as Deputy Hogan pointed out, this is a book exercise; the Minister wants to balance the books irrespective of the consequences on the ground. The 5,000 jobs in question are real jobs for the people concerned. If ten firms shed 500 jobs each between now and Christmas, there would be a hue and cry all over the country and in this Chamber. For some strange reason and because many of the people are at the lower end of the social scale as the Minister sees them, it is all right to throw them out on the dole. It depends on one's philosophy. The philosophy of the Progressive Democrats on this issue is sickening many people around the country.The Minister is planning to make 5,000 people redundant next year. It is demeaning to the workers themselves because they are being told that their work is not important. It is demeaning to the people in the development organisations who are the sponsors of the scheme. The Minister is saying to them that this work is not important. As far as the disabled are concerned, no other agency will step in once those workers are pulled out. I do not think the health boards will step in. Who will carry out the tremendous work being done in every parish in the country? It certainly will not be the county councils or the corporations because they do not have the money.Like many other Deputies, in a previous existence I was the chairperson of the town development association in Mountbellew. For years we had no shortage of plans and designs for the future of our town and area – we had a barrow full of them. The minute we left the community centre we had nobody to execute the plans and that is where FÁS workers on CE schemes came in. It meant we had somebody available to carry out the jobs. If the Minister decides to pull out the struts from under this scheme now there will be a huge vacuum in every parish. It is like taking up the railway tracks: somebody will ask why this was allowed happen and in whose name it was done.I remember being in this House in 1985-86 when this measure was introduced. We all know why it was introduced originally, namely to ensure there would be a level of training for a certain type of person who was finding it extremely difficult to find work and to give dignity back to people. It was a way to take as many as possible off the dole and to get a return for the  community from the money being paid. I believe they are still good reasons.There is a huge cohort of workers who are over 50 years of age. They are particularly good at what they do; for the first time in their lives they have found out that they are of considerable use both to themselves and to the community in which they work. This is thanks to the various training mechanisms administered by FÁS. What will happen those people when they are forced to go back on social welfare? Where will they go? The Minister and her Department put a spin on this by saying there are not enough people to fill the available schemes. This is true for some parts of the country because of how the Department has organised the scheme. It means that workers are a year on and a year off and the small population in some areas means that there are not enough people to take the places. At the same time the very people who want to work are at home on the dole. It does not make sense.I have met many community employment workers over the years. They take a pride in what they do and they have benefited from the schemes in their personal development. At the height of the scheme it employed almost 40,000 people. There will be 25,000 at the end of this year and it will be down to 20,000 next year now that the Minister has got her way in the Book of Estimates. In another year the numbers will be down to 10,000 and a huge vacuum will be created in every town and village. There will be nobody left to continue the important work.There are 14 workers on the scheme in my parish of Mountbellew and they were told that they would lose their jobs this week. It was expected that they would be employed on another scheme but that is not to be; they have been told the new scheme will not be in place until next August or September. In the greater Tuam area, I understand that 150 jobs must be suppressed from the scheme before the end of this year in order to meet the targets. That will create hardship for people between now and Christmas.I am aware that the schemes change over time. The Minister and her officials are turning a blind eye to the people I am talking about. Deputy Murphy referred to the changes and I acknowledge that many people will go on to do better for themselves in sustainable employment, but there must be something the Minister's Department can do for that cohort of workers who have no place to go and who have done well on community employment schemes, which have been good for their communities. By removing 5,000 workers from the scheme, the Minister saves €6,000. She has sold 5,000 workers for €6,000; the figure is that small based on what we have been told. What the Minister has done is a disgrace.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I thank Deputy Hogan for the opportunity to speak on this important motion. Community employment schemes are at the heart of rural areas and have played a significant role in what rural Ireland is today, although I know  they are relevant in all areas. I wish to speak about the towns, villages, parishes and half parishes which have been changed by the introduction of community employment schemes which have worked well. One only has to look at small villages, parish churches, graveyards and surrounding areas to see how they have changed so dramatically. Instead of doing nothing, the people on community employment schemes have pride in what they have been able to deliver.I know unemployment figures have come down dramatically over the last eight to ten years, and we will hear that from the Tánaiste in a few minutes. However, I wish to spell out to her that there is a cohort of workers, many of whom are in their fifties, who do not have an alternative. I am thinking of a young man with a handicap who is not capable of working a 40 hour week but who has enjoyed his five years with FÁS. Now he is doomed at 40 something years of age because he will not be able to get back on a scheme. There are no alternatives and the Tánaiste should not tell me there are. I have examined the matter for him and while some things may be possible for some people, they are not for him.There is a market house in my village of Newbliss. One day the people who owned it, the church body, received a letter from the county council to say it was an important listed building and another letter from a different section to say it was derelict and that it needed to be dismantled. That community with the support of FÁS workers and other help transformed that building into the centrepiece of our village. If a few houses were built on a vacant site, it would revolutionise the village completely along with the other work FÁS has done.Inniskeen is the home of Patrick Kavanagh, one of the renowned Irish poets who maybe was not thought so much of during his time on this earth. I attended the Kavanagh weekend last weekend and it was a privilege to see the building and structures in that area as a result of community involvement. There are 15 people over 50 years of age in the half parish of Inniskeen who could help to maintain that property and the work for which IFI and others provided funds. Without FÁS, it could easily close.Clones was devastated during the Troubles and there was only one road into it. A factory there is under pressure at present. Some 40 workers have been let go while the jobs of 100 more are under pressure. I received a letter from a young man working on a FÁS scheme there. He said:By taking part in the CE project at Clones Chamber of Commerce I have found the self-confidence to be part of the workforce after spending several years unemployed. I am a person who was unemployed because of the Troubles along the Border.He went on to state:CE has given me the opportunity to bridge the barriers that prevented me from getting work. If you continue with these cutbacks in  CE, I will experience great difficulty in getting a job, since you have proposed nothing to replace CE that would assist me in the move from welfare to work.I received letters from Monaghan parish group of churches, Annalee, Butlersbridge, County Cavan, and from Ballybay Development Company. Ballybay was a derelict town which was revolutionised. The Tánaiste is taking that workforce from us at a time when people are being made unemployed for a variety of reasons. I beg her to rethink the decision and to make sure these groups are not put out of business and that they can have some dignity.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I thank Deputy Hogan for sharing his time. Since the election I spent much of the summer visiting voluntary organisations in my constituency. They face a lot of worry and stress about their future because of the threat posed by the cut in community employment schemes. I understand the importance of those organisations but I doubt the Tánaiste really understands for what the voluntary sector stands and how dependent it is on these community employment schemes. This is not about numbers or finance but about the soul of Ireland and the contribution made by so many voluntary organisations to Irish life. That goodwill is being threatened by these cutbacks.This is one of the worst decisions I have come across in my 21 years in this House. It is one of the most misguided, heartless decisions made by a Tánaiste who seems to be out of touch with reality and the voluntary groups and is more in touch with the ideals of IBEC and the employer organisations. These decisions are being made because of influence and pressure being applied on this Government. It is wrong that for the sake of €25 per week a person is being removed from gainful employment and placed on the scrap heap of the dole queue.I have encountered people who are worried and stressed because of the threat to their jobs of which they are proud. I attended meetings at which the Tánaiste has been made into one of the most hated political figures in the country not by the groups, but by Fianna Fáil Deputies, her colleagues in Government. I have been to meetings at which they said: "It is not our decision; it is Mary Harney and the Progressive Democrats". These Deputies said they would fight it all the way. As with the first-time buyer's house grant last week, they have the opportunity this week to fight it all the way by coming into the House to express their opinions, but not one of them is here tonight to defend the voluntary organisations they pledged to defend in recent months at meetings which I attended throughout my constituency. These cuts are the equivalent to the closure of two Dell computer factories. If that happened, there would be uproar. These jobs are being sabotaged because people do not understand the importance of voluntary groups.I refer to an article headlined, "Unique teaching facility being throttled by Mary Harney". It states that new ways are needed to fund and provide facilities for the teaching of English as a foreign language to the immigrant support group because of cutbacks in community employment schemes. Instructors servicing the courses were put on the dole queue but some of them are back working free of charge on the courses because of their idealism. Another headline reads, "A unique facility to be lost to Cork". The article refers to Paul, a community employment participant who spends his unsociable working hours on the streets of the city helping drug and alcohol addicts and their families and friends. Although his prescribed hours of work are 19.5 hours per week, his clients know he is available when they need him, day or night. Even the people that he worked with refer their friends and relatives to this man. Thanks to the callous cuts being imposed by this Tánaiste, aided and abetted by Fianna Fáil and all its Deputies, people like this are going to be put out of business. The down and outs who are dependent on this type of service will suffer as a result. People in Government, cocooned by power for over five years, do not seem to realise the reality of the hidden Ireland.I have seen the Tánaiste come to Cork and create a good impression opening new hi-tech industries in modern industrial parks. I have never seen the Tánaiste come to Cork and see the other side of life there, the people and the organisations dependent on semi-voluntary work whose efforts have kept so many social groups and activities together. These are now being put on the rocks by a Government that does not seem to understand what is happening.

I am sure he is normally invited, as all public representatives are, to events I go to unless they are private party matters where I am not discussing official business.I am grateful to Deputy Hogan and his colleagues for tabling this motion and for giving me an opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on this important matter. I very much welcome this debate on the community employment programme as it gives me an opportunity on behalf of the Government to acknowledge the significant contribution they and other labour market measures have made to reducing long-term unemployment over the past number of years and to supporting community services. It is hard to believe from some of the comments made in the earlier part of this debate that we used to have one community employment place for every six long-term unemployed people when the second last Government left office. Today we have one community employment place for every long-term unemployed person—

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	251	This debate also gives me an opportunity to clarify current participation levels on the programme and the estimated participation levels for 2003 as there have been a number of inaccurate comments circulating in the media on this matter in recent weeks. The primary purpose of CE is, as a transitional labour market programme, to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed with a view to their reintegration into open labour market employment. As part of an overall restructuring of the programme approved by Government in 1999, place numbers are being reduced on a phased basis in line with the reduced levels of long-term unemployed. There has been a strategic shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contained a commitment to reduce overall place numbers on community employment to 28,000 by 2003 through a reallocation of funding equivalent  to 5,000 places to the social economy, together with the reduction of 4,500 places required by the Government's decision of 21 July 1999. The Government's consistent position on this commitment has been that mainstreaming comes below the reduction to 28,000 places associated with restructuring. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions in the discussions with the social partner representatives in the standing committee on the labour market, and in my responses to a number of parliamentary questions on the restructuring of community employment.Mainstreaming involves the transfer of an appropriate level of funding from the FÁS budget for community employment to the relevant Department with primary functional responsibility for the services in question. This is happening at present in the case of community employment schools services. On completion in 2003, the equivalent of some 4,500 places will have transferred to the education sector. Under this arrangement, an additional €58 million is to be made directly available to schools on an annual basis, phased in by 2003, in order to provide replacement services in schools. This will enable schools to improve on the level of secretarial and caretaking support that was available through community employment and will provide greater certainty and flexibility in the funding of such services.Reports that community employment places are being reduced in the order of 13,000 in the current year are wildly inaccurate. Participation levels on community employment this year will average 28,000, and the estimated closing level at the end of the year will be in the order of 25,000. This compares to 30,809 participants on community employment at the beginning of this year.Public speculation about the level of reductions in community employment in 2003 due to budgetary constraints is also somewhat exaggerated. As indicated in the recently published Estimates volume, a total of €274.738 million is being provided for community employment in 2003, which will provide for an average participation rate of approximately 22,000 during the year with a closing participation rate of around 20,000. This remains a very significant intervention in this labour market area.A further €46.169 million is being provided for the job initiative programme which will provide for an average of 2,500 places. In addition to the budgetary provision, participation levels on community employment in 2003 will be decided by other factors, including the rate of progression by participants into the open labour market, the underlying trend in employment and unemployment, the completion of mainstreaming of places into the education sector, and consideration of any further element of mainstreaming.It is important to view current participation levels on community employment in an overall labour market context. According to the CSO's Quarterly National Household Survey, Third Quarter 2002 there are currently 21,800 long-term  unemployed persons, a reduction of some 68,400 since 1997, or 76%, in the period since the current Government parties took office; the unemployment rate is currently 4.6%, representing a marginal increase over the third quarter of 2000, while the long-term unemployment rate remains at 1.2% as compared with 5.5% in 1997; employment now stands at 1,794,800, an increase of 8,200 in the year and an increase by some 322,500 since 1997; participation rates have increased in all age groups aged 45 and over, in the year to the third quarter 2002, with increases being greatest for females; many low skilled jobs continue to be filled by overseas personnel from both the EU and further afield; and the number of work permits issued increased from 6,000 in 1999 to over 36,400 in 2001. Some 38,000 work permits have been issued so far this year.It is worth noting overall that despite the reduction in place numbers from 39,420 in April 1998 to in the order of 25,000 places anticipated at the end of 2002, there are still more community employment places than there are long-term unemployed. Even with the proposed reduction in numbers in 2003, the average number of places available will be 22,000 as against 21,800 people in long-term unemployment.The administration of community employment, including the allocation of places to individual projects, is a matter for FÁS. That agency prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality. The agency also makes every effort to co-ordinate reductions so as to minimise the effects on groups and services which are most in need of community employment. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in disadvantaged areas under the new RAPID initiative are given priority. Community employment places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at the start of the year level to ensure continuity in the delivery of these services.The Government acknowledges the important contribution of community employment to the development of services for local community groups and organisations the length and breadth of the country. A clear and tangible demonstration of the Government's awareness of the importance of support for community services and their development is the recent establishment of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.Some 62%, or six out of every ten, of community employment activities in 2002 support community services in health care, community centres and ICTU employment centres. Other areas supported include services such as those relating to the environment, sport and coaching.Community employment was originally conceived as an active labour market programme intended to assist the progression of long-term unemployed persons back into work by providing  market related work experience. However, over the years, and particularly during periods of high unemployment, community employment has been used to address a much wider range of problems utilising the high availability of labour. As community employment participation expanded, a range of community services developed a dependency on a large and steady supply of community employment participants.In general, the basis on which community employment has been operated over the years has given rise to two main issues of concern, which have been brought to the fore as community employment levels are reduced in the context of the current labour market environment. First, there is a large dependency across the country on the availability of community employment personnel to support a wide range of community services which are now regarded by local communities as essential, and which are important to the delivery of other Government social initiatives such as child care and, second, there is a loss of labour market progression, exacerbated as the absolute numbers of participants on community employment schemes reduces, with the more difficult to progress groups coming to represent a greater percentage of available community employment places.I am aware of increasing concerns in communities as to the impact community employment restructuring and the changed labour market will have on their ability to provide services. In this regard, there is a need to ensure communities get the best value from the reduced pool of community employment now available. Priorities must reflect current rather than past needs.I would like to avail of this opportunity to advise the House of a number of reviews which are in train and which will have an important bearing on the scale and type of community employment activity that will operate in the future. FÁS is undertaking an international review of community employment, which will include an assessment of the role of community employment from a labour market perspective and taking account of the provision of community services. The PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, chaired by my Department. This review is being facilitated by a report by Indecon Consultants on the effectiveness of existing active labour market programmes which is now about to be considered by the standing committee. A key focus of this examination relates to the reorientation of programmes, including the development of the training component of community employment so that the collective focus will be on the needs of the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups to ensure the emphasis is on progression to, and is relevant to the needs of, the open labour market.Policy in regard to the participation of older persons on community employment will also form an important part of that review process.  Given that the issues arising have an impact beyond the labour market dimension, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future operation of community employment having due regard to the contribution now being made by community employment to community services and concerns expressed by the social partners and key stakeholders. The experience to date with the implementation of the social economy programme will also be considered in this context.The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of community employment. Since it was launched in September 2000 there has been a significant level of roll-out of the social economy programme. There have been 773 applications for support to develop business plans; 600 of these applications for business plan grant support – up to a maximum of €5,080 in each case – have been approved; 324 social economy enterprises have been approved for full start-up grant support, with an employment commitment of approximately 2,000 grant supported employees; and 230 of these approved enterprises have commenced operations and 1,450 grant supported employees are in place, two-thirds of whom are working full time.The budget approved for the social economy programme in the current year is €20.5 million compared with €6.6 million in 2001. This funding is now fully committed to the social economy enterprises which have been approved to date. Accordingly, no new enterprises are being approved at present. More than €30 million is being made available for the social economy in 2003, enabling the 324 enterprises approved under the programme to continue to operate. In the current economic climate FÁS is not inviting new applications under the programme for the present. Next year will represent a process of consolidation for the social economy programme with a focus on enhancing the sustainability and viability of the established social economy.

In this context, I should mention in particular the provision of training and employment supports for the disabled and for those experiencing difficulty in entering the labour market.Overall investment in FÁS training schemes is being maintained close to 2002 levels. The Exchequer contribution of €73.518 million is complemented this year by a €222.055 million contribution from the national training fund, bringing the overall investment in 2003 in FÁS training initiatives to €295.573 million. Again, FÁS will prioritise, in so far as possible, the training and employment supports for the disabled within their overall allocations.The allocation for 2003 to FÁS employment programmes is set at almost €365 million. This level of investment is consistent with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment or CE. Participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.

Some 15.5% of participants are persons with disabilities, for whom CE is considered particularly important as a transition programme and in enhancing their employment prospects in the open labour market.In the case of those with disabilities, it is worth noting recent important developments in the area of vocational guidance and training for this disadvantaged group in a labour market context. Training and employment services for people with disabilities were restructured in June 2000 as part of the Government's policy of mainstreaming services to people with disabilities. The objective of the Government's policy is to provide services to people with disabilities in an integrated way which offers them more choice than was previously available. This approach is in accordance with the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was published in 1996.Under the restructuring, responsibility for vocational training and employment of people with disabilities in the open labour market transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Responsibility for social skills and personal development training, referred to as "rehabilitative training", and for sheltered occupational services remained with the Department of Health and Children. Employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as part of general labour market policy, underlining the move from a medical attitude to disability to an inclusive economic and social view of it.

Of the balance, perhaps 21,000, it appears that many of the persons constitute replacement personnel in respect of persons who have left jobs in Ireland. It is worth bearing in mind that about 55% of work permits issued in 2001 are not being renewed, suggesting a continued high rate of turnover in the work permit population.This rate of movement suggests that many jobs fall vacant on departure of overseas personnel and that these tend to be filled by new personnel from overseas. Given that many of the jobs in question are at the lower end of the skills spectrum, it has to be asked if a growing number of these cannot be filled by persons moving off CE. This would not, of course, mean displacing any overseas personnel already in jobs here.

This is one of the most important issues we will debate in this session. It is interesting that in the case of the motion last week, which concerned another Progressive Democrats Minister, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Progressive Democrats backbenchers were whipped in to read from the script factory or, sorry, from the extended notes provided by the Department—

He has gone off the script for a minute.Obviously, the issue before the House tonight is not deemed to be of the same importance, so there are no Progressive Democrats backbenchers or any backbenchers in the Government benches tonight. It is a matter of no great importance to them that another 5,000 people, in addition to an earlier 5,000, have been thrown off the scheme this year. That is a reduction of 10,000 places since the start of the year.I looked at the figures given by the Minister when she talked about exaggerations. There seems to be a propensity on the part of this Government to give out the most disastrous figures, so that when a mild calamity is visited on the people it is not considered too bad. The social employment schemes, as they were then known, were piloted in the Wexford constituency in the mid-1980s by the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. They were innovative schemes which raised eyebrows. People wondered if they would work, how they would impact on the labour market and how people would adjust to them.

There should be no crocodile tears from the Tánaiste or the Minister of State. To gainsay that would be acceptable to any right-thinking Member.The schemes had an important impact in a number of respects. One was the impact on participants. People who often regarded themselves as unemployable, and who were for a long period, were given the dignity of work. Many progressed to full-time employment, but many did not. Nonetheless, they were at least given the chance to be valued in their communities. That might be of no consequence to the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, but it was of great value in the lives of individuals blessed with the opportunity, acknowledgement and leg up for the first time in many cases.The second important impact it had was on communities. It provided services that would not have been provided otherwise. This remains the case. I disagree with Deputy Hogan in that I do not believe the primary motivation is to save money. It is not a number crunching exercise. It is a core ideological issue for the Progressive Democrats and the Minister for Finance. They regard this as a distortion of their notion of the labour market. They want to free up as many low-paid people as they can to take jobs at the lowest rate possible. The distortion of the CE schemes causes difficulty for the supporters of the Progressive Democrats.The notion of mainstreaming which the Tánaiste put forward as the ideal has not worked in many instances because the numbers involved and the level of support available, for example, in supporting schools, is a fraction of that available under these schemes and does not measure up to the promise made by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science.The Tánaiste's amendment is cynical in the extreme and I wish I had the time to discuss it in detail. To suggest as she did that the valuable and critical work which she acknowledged was done will be taken up and protected is not a fact. Many critical jobs will not be done, and the great irony is that people who are willing, able and proud to do the work will be deprived of the opportunity for a lousy few euro per week. It is shameful.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The most conservative of societies, the Japanese, provide for social employment knowing that useful social work can be done by people whose jobs can be valued. That is protected within the Japanese system. The issue for the Government is to have the most reactionary form of labour market policy that makes no allowances for people who want to provide a critical service that cannot be measured by this Progressive Democrats economic yardstick that has a warped sense of values in the context of the useful work these people can do in communities, sports clubs, health services, personal services to people who need support, and the arts. All these change a rough, brutal society into a caring one with an inherent value and sense of its own worth.The Tánaiste's aim is not just to reduce participation in the community employment schemes by the end of next year to 20,000. By limiting the duration of the schemes to three years, it is her aim to end them. This will be glossed over by issues such as mainstreaming. There will be the pretence that other agencies will take up the slack and provide the supports and work done in CE schemes. Next year is a critical one and the economic downturn we are facing will be the backdrop for the implementation of a ruthless Progressive Democrats agenda.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, has decided to abolish the community employment schemes operated by FÁS. On her watch, the numbers employed on the schemes will have been reduced each year from 40,500 in 1997 to 20,000 next year. She is half-way to her objective. This is in line with her low wage policy which states that the more labour available on the market, the higher the competition for the places available and the lower the wages forced on workers. That is the gospel according to the Progressive Democrats. By dumping 5,000 CE workers on the scrapheap without concern for their future or welfare, she is furthering her objective of providing cheap labour for her friends among private employers.The Tánaiste has more than one string to her bow in seeking a pool of cheap labour. The other instrument she is using to a large extent is the importation of large numbers of non-national workers, mostly from eastern Europe. By virtue of the conditions of the work permits she issues to the workers, they are virtually bonded labour. They are tied to one employer at the pain of deportation which is a constant threat from employers. They work long and hard hours for minimal rates which are often less than the minimum wage.

They are packed into expensive, overcrowded tenements. In short, they are grossly exploited and abused. Now, 5,000 CE workers are to be dumped on the scrapheap to further the Tánaiste's right-wing policies.Where are the caring voices among the Fianna Fáil party? As usual, they will cry crocodile tears on local radio and in local papers for the axed FÁS schemes and turn up in the House to vote the measure through. They are thereby exposed as the hypocrites they are.In my constituency, the axe on the FÁS CE schemes has fallen in a brutal manner. In Clane,  Leixlip and Celbridge, the axing has been received with a sense of shock and despair by the organisers of and participants in the schemes. Work done for sports clubs, tidy towns committees and the enhancement of the environment will stop dead in its tracks in these towns and communities. One scheme in Celbridge organised by the tidy towns committee was established in 1992. It has 14 employees and a supervisor. They work with the local Church of Ireland, the GAA and the tidy towns committee. The scheme has an excellent record in training its participants and placing them in full-time employment. The environment in Celbridge has been greatly enhanced by the efforts of the scheme. I call on my colleague, Senator Kate Walsh, a resident of Celbridge who boasts of her close relationship and influence with the Tánaiste and who has built her political reputation on her support for community projects, to use her influence and exercise her muscle on behalf of the CE workers in Celbridge. We will know by the outcome how effective her actions will have been. By the fruits of their actions we will know them rather than by their crocodile tears.The workers and trainees on CE schemes in my constituency are special people. They were left out and left behind. They had a semblance of dignity and purpose restored to them by the CE schemes and many became successful in life from their participation in them. Now they are to be dumped. It is to the shame of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and Senator Kate Walsh that they support this savage, uncaring action.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I strongly support the motion because this is something very dear to me. Westmeath was one of the counties to adopt this scheme as a pilot project in 1985 and there was considerable and strenuous opposition to it from a number of sources. As a member of Westmeath County Council, I was glad to champion something that was introduced by a Labour Party Minister in a coalition Government. I recall saying what it would mean 17 or 18 years ago. The Royal Canal was closed and some far-sighted people were suggesting it should remain closed and made into a road to Dublin. Having been born on the banks of the Royal Canal, I had a bit of initiative and I joined a local group, the Royal Canal Amenity Group. From the acorn seed the oak tree grew. Everyone wants to jump on a bandwagon, but without the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, that canal would never have re-opened. They formed the driving force behind that and it has tremendous tourism potential. Millions are being spent on it and millions more are needed to ensure it is finished from Ballynacargy to Richmond Harbour in Clondra to allow people to complete a circuit and come down on the Royal Canal and return on the Grand Canal. This would go past where Deputy Enright lives and I  am sure she would be delighted with the tourism, which is critical to many rural areas.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	318	In any event money was scarce and we adopted a scheme. Westmeath County Council had a skilled carpenter. A number of people were trained at the time under the social employment scheme. They commenced the manufacture of the lock gates, which was the first step in the restoration of the Royal Canal. Most of the people who were trained to become skilled carpenters at that time are in the construction industry today. That shows how important the scheme was at that time. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is right in saying it was a time of high unemployment, but it was used extensively because money was and still is scarce in rural areas. The myth of the phantom tiger only touched urban areas. Rural areas are still isolated and in relative poverty.Most of the people on the scheme today have no access to transport, public or private, and they are relatively poor. They are disadvantaged and include people who are becoming elderly. They want a chance to make a contribution to the community and the dignity of doing so. This is why it has been an essential scheme to the local community organisations, the GAA, rugby, soccer and hockey clubs, voluntary and community groups, and to the tidy towns. Every village has been transformed by the skills those people have acquired. They have a reason to get out of bed in the morning and are making a valuable contribution to the community. Every village and town in the country has improved its performance in the tidy towns competition as a result of those people's efforts. Why do we want to hit the disadvantaged and the vulnerable at this time? If a mess has been made of the economy, it should not be visited on the ordinary people and the poorer sections of the community.As Deputy Howlin said, in January 2002 there were 30,000 people in the scheme. In a year the Minister has set out to dismantle it and has already smitten one third from that number. If the Government cannot find any more Central Bank reserves or cannot raid any more pension funds, will the Minister smite the other 20,000? No evaluation has been carried out on the savings that accrue from the scheme. Many of those people will end up back on the live register. As they say in our place, where is the beef and where are the savings? This is an ideologically driven exercise. The essence of what we stand for is solidarity with and commitment to communities.What about the Carers Association that depends on the community employment scheme for secretarial and supervisory help? There are 100,000 carers and there are Carers Association houses across the country. People from the community employment scheme form an important part of that. We already insult them by giving  them a couple of cent an hour. We are now going to take the scheme away as well. What about the centres for independent living? We are being told about mainstreaming. This is all fudge as was the excuse about internal reviews. The outcome was to slash 10,000 people from the scheme over 12 months.As I have said on many occasions, in areas such health and education, it is the disadvantaged who are always asked to foot the bill for the economic problems that have been generated by Government mismanagement and incompetence. What about the impact this will have on literacy and numeracy courses? We are all committed to ensuring that people who did not have a chance are now given one. Many of those courses involve people from the community employment scheme. Surely it is wrong to eliminate those. Cultural associations, community crèches, schools, etc., have all been helped out. The work is of inestimable value. Any cost benefit analysis would show the scheme in a positive light.The people who will be severely disadvantaged will undoubtedly be the long-term jobless and the elderly in rural areas. The cuts will cause havoc and desolation at individual and community level. I recently met a supervisor on a project. Many projects were compelled to come together in order to retain a supervisor. What will happen when the numbers inevitably drop? The supervisor will disappear.

Insidious pressure has already been applied to wipe them out. What savings will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of this decision? Will those people now in the scheme have to revert back to the live register?What about the child care policy advocated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? How will that be delivered in disadvantaged areas where CE schemes play an important role? Has there been any examination of the wider impact or did the Tánaiste take this decision simply because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told her to make savings in her Department? Of course, people of like mind focus on the one area and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was delighted to deliver.Has any evaluation been done on the impact these cuts will have on lone parents? The decreasing number of places available to this group will obviously result in a decrease in family income with the loss of the CE allowance. Given the difficulties in accessing child care at an affordable cost, will that limit their potential to progress into paid work?These represent a small number of the areas that I have examined which will be impacted. The  Government is grossly mistaken in the course on which it is embarking.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter.We can all recall last April when people in every constituency were angered – I would not say shocked because many people were aware of the state of many of our school buildings – by the results of an INTO survey which showed that the accommodation in some 100 schools was unfit for students and teachers. At that stage the election campaign was under way and we were gearing up for our day out. In every constituency Government candidates made promises about primary schools. People were left with a strong expectation that local schools would be completed. This was not done solely via word of mouth, but also on local radio and in local newspapers throughout the country.The position today is very different from the expectation created last April and May. At meetings held during the election campaign significant pressure was placed on all candidates. People were told their school was on the list, there was no cause for concern and their local school would be built. Nothing has happened since. The Department's website, to which we have been directed recently instead of receiving detailed replies to parliamentary questions, lists 27 projects as recently completed. We are not told how recently they were completed. It also states that a further 24 projects have gone to tender and 401 projects are at various stages of architectural planning. None of these 401 schools knows when its case will be dealt with or how soon the work will commence. This is a major problem.In the Estimates much play was made of the fact that extra funding has been provided to appoint more resource teachers. While this is welcome news, resource teachers cannot work unless they have a place in which to work. One cannot overstate the problem we are facing in this regard. On a visit to a school in my constituency last week, I had to jump from the school gate into the school yard because it was so flooded. The children had nowhere to go on their break apart from the school yard. They are neither tall enough nor old enough to do the jump I did.I asked to be directed to the staff room. On stepping into it, I discovered there was no space for me to stand. Two teachers were seated having lunch and there was another seat for a further teacher, but there was no room for anyone else. This is where the teaches eat their lunches. Some people will have no sympathy for teachers having to take their 30 minute lunch break in those conditions. The room in question is also the work  space of the resource and remedial teachers. Students who need to go to resource or remedial teachers are already in a more difficult position than other students and have more to cope with. It is unacceptable that they are being placed in such conditions to get the extra help they need.We should commend teachers on enduring the conditions in which they work. It is a miracle they remain in their jobs. I would not be able to work in the conditions under which they work. It is not an exaggeration to say some schools are rat infested and damp. Some have cracks in the walls, leaking toilets and corridors filled with coats, books and art equipment. This is illegal and breaches all health and safety regulations. If a fire broke out in one of these schools, I do not know what would happen. The teachers and principals have no choice other than to store things in corridors because there is no other physical space.We have to decide how we will proceed with schools building. It must be prioritised and we must get value for money. Tubbercurry school, which opened yesterday, is a fine example of a public private partnership. However, the Minister must face the reality that private investors will not want to operate public private partnerships in small, rural, one or two teacher schools. They want a return for their money and will not get it in these types of facility.Allowing 401 schools to proceed to the architectural planning stage when the reality is that they will be stuck in that stage for time immemorial constitutes a huge waste on the part of the Department. These schools do not know when they will proceed to the next stage. Principals and teachers are wasting their time preparing submissions and meeting and paying architects because the schools will not make progress. This is not acceptable. The building programme must be prioritised and funding allocated because primary school children cannot be allowed to continue to attend school in the current circumstances.

In 1997 a total of €43.4 million was available for first level capital spending. Expenditure in 2003 will be €172.6 million. As a result of the Government's commitment to funding educational infrastructure, in excess of 120 major capital projects in the primary sector have been recently completed or are under construction at a cost of €187 million. Many of these projects will continue in construction into 2003.On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I want to dispel a misunderstanding that  has arisen in relation to the 400 major primary school projects in architectural planning listed in one of today's newspapers. The majority of these projects were never intended to start construction in 2002 and were consequently not included in the 2002 construction programme.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Because they are major projects, they have to go through a detailed process of architectural planning which can take a considerable period of time to complete. The financial commitments to be met from building projects already in construction are also an important factor in determining the number of projects that may proceed at any given time. It is the Department's intention to release the projects in architectural planning to construction on a phased basis over a number of years. All applications to the Department for capital funding are subject to a detailed process of prioritisation.Priority is given to the following broad categories of projects: new schools to cater for substantial increases in enrolments in rapidly developing areas where no other primary school exists; accommodation which is urgently required for children with special needs, such as autism, speech and language disorder, severe and profound mentally handicap etc.; the replacement-refurbishment of very poor buildings, including old prefabricated buildings, an example of which would be a structurally unsound building; and the provision of accommodation which is necessary to facilitate agreed amalgamations.The primary responsibility for health and safety in school buildings rests with the school management authorities. The Department of Education and Science will assist schools in fulfilling these obligations. In addition to the capital grants made available to schools under the grant scheme for minor works to national school properties amounting to €18 million annually, a further 1,700 grants for national schools have been sanctioned this year amounting to €61 million. About one third of these grants were in respect of health and safety works to school properties. The remaining grants were for temporary accommodation and the purchase of essential furniture and equipment.The Minister for Education and Science intends to examine the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools' modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency. The Minister for Education and Science intends publishing his expenditure proposals for primary school buildings in the new year. The Department's website will be updated at regular intervals from that point on.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise the decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to close Shanganagh Castle open centre for young male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. The facility is located in my constituency. I am disappointed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here in person to respond to the matter raised on the Adjournment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appears to be spending more time doing the job of other Ministers than applying himself to his own brief.His decision to close Shanganagh Castle is one of the most short-sighted to have been made in a long time and shows very little understanding by him of the need for rehabilitation of young offenders. The Minister is justifying this decision – the Taoiseach justified it on the same grounds – by reference to the low number of inmates who are accommodated at Shanganagh Castle and the relatively high cost of the accommodation. It currently houses 16 inmates even though it has a capacity of 60. The reason for the low numbers is very simple, it has been deliberately run down. I challenge the Minister on his decision.There are 400 young male offenders aged between 16 and 21 who are now accommodated mainly in closed centres in the prison system. I do not accept that there is not at least 10% of these who would be suitable for accommodation in Shanganagh Castle. That is what we are talking about in order to maintain this facility at full capacity. Indeed, nine of the young offenders are already in an open facility for adults in Shelton Abbey. I do not see why, if an open facility for adults is suitable for young offenders, the actual facility for young offenders ought not to be available to them.In response to a Dáil question last week, the Minister stated that the average cost of a young offender in Shanganagh Castle is €127,000 while the average cost in the rest of the prison system is €79,000. It is, of course, going to be more expensive if the numbers are kept at a third of the capacity of the facility. If it is allowed to operate to its full capacity then the numbers are turned around. In fact, on a financial basis it becomes a much more cost effective method of detaining and rehabilitating young offenders, and that is not taking into account the value one places on rehabilitation which appears to have a very low priority in the Minister's consideration of this issue.Since the Minister is interested in making comparisons, let me offer him some others. Since this facility was opened in 1969, no young offender has committed suicide nor has there been a case of serious self-mutilation. No other facility in the rest of the penal system can claim such a record. I also ask the Minister to compare the success rate of this facility in regard to rehabilitation. I would like him to compare the number of repeat  offenders in Shanganagh Castle with any of the other penal institutions in the country. He will find that, by and large, those who have come through Shanganagh Castle have not re-offended. That claim cannot be made for any other facility. Let us also compare it in terms of local community support. If one was to try and open such a centre, it would, most likely, meet with resistance from the local community. Yet, here is a facility which enjoys local community support. A further point in support of Shanganagh Castle is that the excellent education facilities provided by the County Dublin VEC are not provided elsewhere in the prison system.I advise any Fianna Fáil land speculator who may be eyeing up this land for purchase to stay away from it. This facility constitutes part of the green belt between Shankill and Bray. A big financial killing will not be made on the sale of the 24 acres of land on which this facility is located, even if it is sold, because there would be enormous local resistance to these lands being developed for any other purpose.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I am standing in for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and I apologise for him not being here. This matter was raised last week and Deputy Gilmore is already in possession of much of the information relating to it.On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I wish to clarify the position in relation to the open detention centre at Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, County Dublin. Shanganagh Castle was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. The centre, which stands on grounds of 24 acres, has dormitory accommodation for 60 inmates, so it would not be deemed to be modern accommodation. However, it has been increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison accommodation.Shanganagh Castle had an average offender occupancy of 30 inmates last year and this has fallen this year. There were as few as 16 inmates being detained there recently. In addition, the full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, means that 16 and 17 years old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system, resulting in a further drop in those offenders who might be found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle. I do not know if that is something on which people reflected when that legislation was being passed, but it is a consequence of it. The annual cost of keeping an offender at Shanganagh Castle in 2001 was €127,000, which is significantly higher than the average overall cost per prisoner of €79,000 in the same year. I accept that those figures can be a bit twisted.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rejects suggestions that there has been a deliberate policy of under-utilising Shanganagh Castle over recent years. While there is a con siderable number of persons aged between 16 and 21 years currently detained in closed prison institutions, it is misleading to imply that all, or a significant number, would be eligible or suitable for a transfer to Shanganagh Castle. I note the comments made by Deputy Gilmore. There is a certain logic in what he says, if it is true that there are people of that age in another open prison. I will convey that information to the Minister. I do not have an answer for that at present.A variety of initiatives were taken to increase the number of inmates in the centre. Among these were the implementation of new procedures for dealing with assessments of candidates for Shanganagh Castle. However, many offenders in this age group are either unsuitable or are not eligible for a transfer to the centre for various reasons. In addition, offenders are often unwilling to transfer to Shanganagh Castle, an important consideration in an open detention centre.In view of the very considerable decline in the number of young offenders found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle in recent years, the Irish prisons service established a group to examine the options for its continued use as a detention centre. While the report of the group identified an increase in the upper age limit of offenders as one option, they also recognised that "if none of the recommended options were considered viable then, as the current regime at Shanganagh Castle cannot be justified on operational or financial grounds, the closure of the castle and the subsequent disposal of the site will have to be considered".The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asked me to stress that he recognises the important service that Shanganagh Castle and its staff have given to the prison system, in particular in terms of dealing with juvenile offenders, over the years. However, having carefully considered this report, the centre's current viability, and the options available for its future use, it is the Minister's intention to close it in order to make more effective use of prisons service staffing and other resources, and to release funds through the sale of Shanganagh Castle to be re-invested in the prisons service more effectively.The small number of inmates currently in Shanganagh Castle can be accommodated elsewhere in the prison system without difficulty. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes that the needs of offenders in this age category can be adequately met elsewhere in the prison system, in particular in St. Patrick's Institution. This institution, which currently houses offenders in the same age category as Shanganagh Castle, has introduced important new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders, including a positive sentence management programme. In addition, a successful drug-free wing with 76 spaces has been in operation in St. Patrick's since November 2000. This wing allows inmates who do not have a background of drug abuse and those who have demon strated a desire to stop taking drugs to be detained in a drug-free and secure environment. A study conducted by the European Conference on Drugs and HIV-AIDS Services in Prisons indicated that St. Patrick's Institution was an example of best practice in the area of drug policy in establishments of its type.Closure of Shanganagh Castle will also necessitate the re-assignment of its complement of 43 Prisons Service staff to other institutions. The terms of such re-assignments will be the subject of discussions with the Prison Officers' Association. Discussions will also be necessary with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in regard to the position of the full-time and part-time teachers at Shanganagh Castle. The probation and welfare officer assigned to the centre will be assigned to other duties.The closure and sale of Shanganagh Castle is a decision not taken lightly, but it is a decision aimed at positive re-investment in the prisons and at maximising the use of the resources available to the Prisons Service.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I wish to share time with Deputy Allen. The Government is forcing local authorities to increase commercial rates this year by up to 10% and waste collection charges by up to 300%. However, when everything is considered there is still a shortfall of approximately €0.5 billion in the Estimates. Each household will pay up to €400 next year for refuse collection. Small businesses, under pressure due to massive increases in insurance costs, will again be hit with significant increases in rates. Farmers, pub owners and restaurateurs will have to suffer increased water charges. The farming community must survive more increases as prices for its products continue to decline and it cannot pass on the increased costs. Rates hikes and soaring insurance costs will be passed on to the consumer, thereby increasing inflation at a time the Government is calling for wage restraint.Cork County Council will need an extra €22 million to meet the wage and salary increases agreed by central government. The deferred PPF current round will cost €4.1 million, the initial payment under benchmarking will cost €10.3 million and additional staff as a consequence of the  Government's decision to introduce better local government will cost approximately €8 million. This does not take into account increases under the new national agreement.In addition, a waste levy of €3.2 million must be paid to central government. This will mean that the council will run a deficit of €37 million next year. which equates to the total rates support grant that it received from the Government last year. What services does the Government want local authorities to cut because of its unwillingness to compensate them for wage increases? Local authorities will be forced to cut back on their housing programmes and reduce spending on county roads, water and sewerage schemes, fire services, library services, town and village renewal programmes and all services needed by citizens on a day-to-day basis.The Government must take responsibility for these cutbacks. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must fund local authorities to implement benchmarking, better local government and the new national wage agreement. There is no point in Fianna Fáil trying to play Government in Opposition locally on this issue. Cuts at local level will be the result of cuts in local authority funding by the Government and no matter how much Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors protest locally, the bottom line is the cuts would not happen if it were not for the total mismanagement of the economy by the Government, which is kept in power with their support.Every Fianna Fáil Deputy and councillor and their PD collaborators will be held responsible for these cuts. The Government cannot expect to fool all the people all the time.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Deputy Murphy has set out the stark scenario in which local authorities find themselves. The Government is raising taxes and increasing charges to cover up its mistakes and mismanagement over the past number of years and the public will have to pay in terms of higher prices, cutbacks, traffic congestion and poorer roads. Appendix U of the Estimates outlines the stark reality. The estimated spend for local authorities in 2002 is €1,039 million and, if inflation is factored in at 4.5%, a further €41 million is required giving a total of €1,080 million. However, local authorities have only been allocated €975 million leaving a shortfall of €105 million before benchmarking and other salary increases that are due are considered, as Deputy Murphy pointed out.We have been reading about proposals to cut back services and increase charges by a number of local authorities. My local authority is proposing an increase of more than 40% in refuse collection charges. The vast array of new charges and cutbacks mean that since 1997 the total amount raised by way of increased charges is equivalent to the addition of 1 cent or 2 cent to the basic income tax rate and that is unforgivable.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I have been involved in local government for many years. I know at first hand the important role that local government plays in delivering services to all the citizens. I share the concerns expressed about the need for local authorities to have adequate funds at their disposal to provide their customers with quality services and to fulfil the range of functions entrusted to them because I know what is expected of local government and what local government expects of itself.Since I became involved in politics, local government funding has always been a thorny issue. There is never enough money for local authorities to do everything they would like. The story is no different at central government level. The stark reality is there is no bottomless well of funding from which we can keep drawing. If there was, local authorities could justifiably and effectively spend significantly more in improving the range and quality of services they provide to the public.However, the Government has gone a long way towards closing the gap between what we all wish could be achieved at local government level and what can be achieved. In the current year, €593 million has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in general purpose grants. That represents an increase of 75% in five years and an increase of 10% over the 2001 baseline allocations. These increases are well ahead of inflation and, by any yardstick, represent massive strides in empowerment of local government based on resources. While next year might be as good, an increase of 75% over five years cannot be dismissed lightly.The House should acknowledge the scale of this achievement and the extent to which the Government has contributed to putting local government on a sound financial footing after a long period in which it had to struggle financially from one year to the next. The introduction of the local government fund by the Government has seen grants for non-national roads increase by more than 100% since 1997. It is not true to say Governments have wasted money. In the past couple of years much of the money has been invested in services and in capital development. Spending on non-national roads has been increased by 100% in five years. That is a significant move forward.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	335	While much has been achieved, we must also look forward. The Minister is at present finalising proposals for the 2003 local government fund general purpose grant allocations and these will be notified to authorities within the next week or so. The Minister is keenly aware of the issues raised here this evening about the potential cost increases and demands facing authorities next year.All options are being examined to ensure that an appropriate level of general purpose grant can be made available to each local authority. While these grants are of critical importance they contribute only about one fifth of local authorities' current income. It is important for local authorities to look at all their sources of income. They cannot expect everything to come from central funds. As much as 80% of local authorities' funds are sourced in other ways.It is not true for Deputy Murphy to claim that housing, water and other programmes will be damaged. All those programmes are funded from capital grants. The Estimates refer to current expenditure and not to housing or road programmes.In framing the Abridged Estimates the Government took many hard decisions in light of the need to consolidate the public finances by bringing expenditure growth under control. This is a lead which local authorities should follow in managing their affairs and framing their budgets for 2003. The Minister has removed the cap which restricted local authorities in what they could do to commercial rates. It is up to local authorities to manage their business, work on all possible sources of income, look at their expenditure and try to get the best value they can. This is a time for sound and responsible financial management and local authorities should take appropriate decisions to balance their expenditure against income from central and local sources.

However, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. I raise this issue because it is a matter of grave concern to an ever-growing number of people. While I refer specifically to the west Cavan and Leitrim areas I am conscious that this is a problem in many areas of the country and one that warrants the Minister's and the Government's urgent address.I request that the Minister outline the steps it is proposed to take to remove or significantly reduce the current obstacles to development of domestic dwellings and tourism focused projects in west Cavan and Leitrim and specifically to address the inappropriate intervention of An Taisce in many planning cases.I have met with several young people, and some not so young, in the past 12 months. The majority are native to these counties and have returned home after years of forced economic migration elsewhere in Ireland or overseas. Neither they, their families and communities nor I can understand why An Taisce is operating a vendetta against the people of this sprawling and thinly populated rural area. It is an area of great natural beauty and also an underdeveloped area. Over the decades it has lost a significant percentage of its population, has been economically left  behind and continues to offer its marginalised community a rugged and frugal lifestyle.This need not be. The people of west Cavan and Leitrim, of Dowra and the shores of Lough Allen – the first lake on the River Shannon as it makes its way from the Shannon Pot in west Cavan – have every right to enjoy and exploit their home environment in a caring and respectful way. This is not an area designated to remain a wondrous wilderness for people from Dublin and elsewhere to come, in few numbers, on day visits and leave again. It is an area which can and should attract many visitors who would, in turn, bring economic prosperity to its long neglected and marginalised people.The applications of which I speak were almost all approved by Cavan or Leitrim County Councils. An Taisce has been the primary objector to An Bord Pleanála, which appears to be all too ready to agree with the An Taisce line. This causes me and many people great concern. People have spent years of hard work away from home, saving and looking forward to returning and placing their hopes for their futures and their children's futures in the place of their birth. They return to be rejected by strangers in the main and faceless folk who have a picture postcard stake in the area and nothing more. These objectors often do not even reside in Ireland. They have addresses elsewhere in Europe. They object not only to stand-alone rural housing that would bring new life to communities and to churches, schools and to the limited number of commercial and retail outlets in the area, but they also object to tourist focused projects that would give new employment and real hope for a secure future for young couples and their children.The Lough Allen marina proposals would have reaped a €30 million investment and created more than 100 jobs. What would that have meant to an area that has known only impoverishment for decades? Despite the undoubted economic benefits that have accrued from the restoration of the Ballinamore to Ballyconnel canal and the opening of the Lough Allen canal, no economic upturn has been experienced by the people of this lough's shores and its wider hinterland. The boats are entering and leaving just as fast. There is nowhere for them to dock, no attractions they can access or communities with which to interact.This matter needs to be addressed and I appeal to the Minister to give a positive indication of the steps he proposes to take.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Under planning legislation each planning authority must prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Decisions on individual planning applications are also a matter for each local planning authority in accordance with its development plan, or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal. The planning system is very open. There is public participation in the making of development plans and in the planning per mission process. The planning regulations prescribe certain bodies which must be consulted in regard to certain categories of planning application. An Taisce is among these prescribed bodies. As the Deputy is aware an applicant for planning permission or a person who commented on an application at local authority level is entitled to appeal the decision of a local authority to An Bord Pleanála. I expect any person or body commenting on a planning application or making an appeal to do so only on the basis of bona fide land use planning reasons. All planning appellants are by law required to state the subject matter and full grounds of their appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which these are based.An Bord Pleanála has an absolute discretion to dismiss any appeal from whatever source where it is of the opinion that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundations. I am aware that the position adopted by An Taisce in relation to one-off rural housing has attracted considerable controversy in recent times. An Taisce is a non-governmental organisation and is independent in arriving at its policy positions. Many NGOs and community groups may get under our skin occasionally but they have a purpose and their own points of view on policy positions.The debate on one-off rural housing has become polarised in recent times. While I appear as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, as the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs I have strong views on this matter. I hope the policy outlined in the recently published national spatial strategy will help to achieve consensus on this matter.As a member of a local authority I know it can be annoying, particularly if council members and officials make brave decisions, if appeals go to An Bord Pleanála. However, the only way local authority members can try control that is to have a tight development plan, because a lot of the cases in which An Taisce or others are appealing to An Bord Pleanála are cases where the manager, perhaps, did not go along with the recommendation from his planner. If An Taisce or An Bord Pleanála see disputes in Cavan County Council or wherever, they can exaggerate them.Speaking from my own time on the city council, I feel that councils should look at the develop ment plans more thoroughly so decisions cannot be appealed to the same extent. However, An Bord Pleanála is great when it is with us and a nuisance when it goes the opposite way. All public representatives probably feel the same about it and their views on it change from week to week depending on their position on any particular argument.The national spatial strategy sets out a rural housing settlement framework which has four objectives: to sustain and renew established rural communities; to strengthen the established structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies and to accommodate additional population; to ensure that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and economic vitality; and to ensure that rural settlement policies take account of and are appropriate to the differing local circumstances in different areas.To meet these objectives, the NSS holds that housing needs within the established rural community by persons working in rural areas or in nearby urban areas should, subject to good planning practice, be accommodated.Rural-generated housing needs arise for people who are an intrinsic part of the rural community by way of background or the fact that they work full time or part time in rural areas. As a general principle, subject to good planning practice in matters of location, siting, design and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas and areas of high landscape value, rural-generated housing needs should be accommodated in the areas where they arise.With regard to urban-generated housing in the open countryside, development driven by urban areas should take place, as a general principle, within the built up lands and on lands identified, through the development plan process, for integrated, serviced and sustainable development.I will certainly convey the views of Deputy Ó Caoláin to the Minister. Councils can help if they have a tighter development plan and if they can bring forward decisions where the planner, the public representatives and the manager are all on the one side. Other groups who wish to appeal these matters, be they third parties or bodies such as An Taisce, have an easier case if there is disagreement at local authority level.The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 December 2002.

I am also fully confident that my Department will function very successfully and that it will make a significant contribution to Irish life.The Estimates process presented me with the opportunity to critically examine my Department's collective spending programmes, which were previously spread around the Votes of various Departments. This was a useful exercise in the effort to set clear priorities though, of course, some difficult decisions have to be made. However, overall I am satisfied that the allocations announced for my Department are generally close to the projected actual expenditure for 2002.I also point out that direct comparisons with the 2002 allocations – particularly in relation to the administrative budget – are misleading given that the published administration costs for 2002 refer to the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which had significantly more staff and centres of operation than the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

Drugs policy continues to be positioned within the context of wider social inclusion policies and a strong commitment by Government to areas of social and economic disadvantage. While a range of Departments and agencies have responsibilities in the area of social inclusion, my Department oversees a number of initiatives in this area.The local drugs task forces were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. Currently, there are 14 such forces – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray which was designated an LDTF area in 2000.The role of the LDTFs is to prepare local action plans which include a range of measures in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services. They are designed to complement and add value to the extensive range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies.All the LDTFs, with the exception of Bray, are currently implementing their second round of action plans and, to date, over €14.2 million has been allocated. In total, the Government has allocated over €51 million to implement the projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997.The Deputies should note that in addition to the moneys available under the action plans, €12.7 million was provided under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas. To date, over €11 million has been allocated to projects under this initiative.While the overall level of funding available to my Department in 2003 is down, I am very happy to report that there is an increase of 16% in the moneys available for drugs work for 2003. The increase in expenditure for next year clearly reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to addressing the problem, particularly in areas where heroin misuse is most prevalent.

The group which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper.A number of legal issues have arisen in the course of processing the applications. So as to ensure that eventual funding decisions command full public confidence it is necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications.The scheme will therefore be re-advertised at the earliest possible date. Accordingly, it will be necessary for any applicants who applied for funding under this scheme to re-apply under the re-advertised scheme should they wish to be considered for this funding. My Department will contact applicants by letter within the next week or so to inform them of the position.

The principle states that quality services should be provided through Irish and/or bilingually and that customers should be informed of their right to choose to be dealt with through one or other of the official languages. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department, as the Department assigned responsibility by Government for the promotion of the Irish language, was already fully committed to that principle. In such circumstances, no specific  additional costs arose of the nature referred to by the Deputy.

In considering what the most appropriate structure might be, the Deputy should note that any early warning system will necessarily involve a number of agencies and information sources.

This encompasses the Leader programmes, INTERREG, PEACE Programme and CLÁR.While the 2003 provision for Leader and the rural development measures in PEACE and INTERREG are reduced from 2002 by 4% it is not anticipated that the programme cuts will have any significant negative impacts over the lifetime of the programmes. These programmes are EU co-financed and run until 2006 with the bulk of spend expected in the second half of the programmes. I am satisfied that the 2003 allocation will be sufficient to meet the commitments under the programmes.Although the provision for CLÁR is reduced from the 2002 allocation, I expect that I will be able to complete a comprehensive work programme in 2003. CLÁR funds act as a lever to elicit funds from other sources. The 2003 CLÁR allocation will be sufficient to continue this leverage to sustain an effective programme.The decrease in the 2003 allocation will not, in any way, detract from either this Government's commitment or my own in ensuring that the problem of depopulation, decline and lack of services in rural areas is tackled.With reference to the Western Development Commission, the reason for the reduction in the allocation to the western investment fund simply reflects the projected actual expenditure in 2002. The review of the Western Development Commission is also ongoing.The State will spend approximately €265 million next year on community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs. This shows the continued commitment, even in these times of financial pressure, to the priority work undertaken by my Department. All contractual commitments entered into under CAIT I and CAIT II will be honoured. In the reorganisation of community development structures, the obvious way to deliver access to IT to is who had previously benefited from the CAIT programme is through community development organisations. These are already working on the ground in areas covered by many CAIT target groups.

Capital grants are also available for the provision or improvement of community facilities such as halls and playing fields. Through the improvement of infrastructure in Gaeltacht areas it is the objective of these schemes to improve and enhance the social, cultural and economic life of these regions and at the same time to strengthen Irish as this community's first language.A seven year programme of works, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, was initiated in 2000. The objective of the seven year plan is to have one road of suitable standard into every Gaeltacht area before 2007. Funding is also provided through scéim na mbóithre áise for the improvement of accommodation roads, bog roads and village renewal projects.A total of €10.294 million has been allocated for these schemes in 2003. It is intended to continue with the Gaeltacht improvement schemes programme, including the completion of certain marine works – strategic piers at Blacksod, County Mayo, Bunbeg, County Donegal and Cill Chiaráin, County Galway. The seven year plan for strategic roads is on target at this stage.Also, expenditure on other Gaeltacht schemes within my Department has been sustained or increased in the estimates for 2003.

This report was passed to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North which co-sponsors the body. In March 2002 the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure requested that the consultants be asked to clarify a number of aspects of the report, mainly in relation to economic assumptions and social needs. This was received in June 2002. It is clear from the report that the project would not be justifiable on economic grounds. Therefore, any consideration would have to be on the basis of the social and general cross-Border benefits to the areas through which the canal passes. A further report was recently commissioned by Waterways Ireland into the various funding options that might exist, and this report is likely to be available in February 2003. On completion of this report the possibility of initiating work on the Ulster Canal will be considered further, North and South. However, I cannot indicate the final outcome at this stage.

The present position regarding their establishment is that nominations have been sought from the various sectors involved, including statutory, community and voluntary areas. The national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines for their operation in consultation the relevant sectors and agencies.Regarding the membership, it is proposed that the membership of the RDTFs will, where appropriate, include representation from the following sectors-agencies: area-based partnerships, community sector, Department of Education and Science, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, FÁS, the Garda Síochána, the health boards, local Authorities, the probation and welfare service, public representatives, the Revenue Commissioners customs and excise division, the VEC and the voluntary sector.In relation to representatives of the statutory sector, it is proposed that each Department-agency will nominate one representative to the RDTF. The representatives should hold senior positions within their organisations, so that they can effectively participate in the work of the RDTF.It is proposed that the community fora, which nominate members to the social inclusion groups of the city-county development boards, should have responsibility for the nomination process in relation to the community representatives. The nomination process must take account of the need for a broad based consultation with community groups who are interested and-or involved in the drugs issue. In relation to voluntary members, voluntary networks have been set up in nearly all RDTF areas. These networks will nominate the voluntary representatives to the RDTF.

The strategy aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.The strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.Since it was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, IDG, which I chair, meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings.

An area implementation team was established in each of these areas to prepare a plan for the area. Plans were approved by the relevant city/county development boards, prior to being sent to the national co-ordinator for the programme at Area Development Management Limited – ADM. Proposals from the plans were then forwarded to the relevant Government Department for consideration. While proposals from strand one were forwarded to Departments some time ago, initial strand two proposals were only recently submitted to Departments.It is a matter for individual Departments to report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within their remit. Regarding my Department, proposals from strand one RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, the community development programme, CDP, and funding for the drugs initiative.In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, the position is that the national assessment committee of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round two of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting the completion of the external evaluation of the fund, which is due shortly, before seeking such proposals under round two. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round two and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.A number of proposals from RAPID plans that are relevant to the drugs initiative, are being pursued through the local drugs task force plans.Eight priority areas for development of a community development project have been identified in the RAPID plans i.e., Loughlinstown, Shanganagh, Crumlin, Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, CDP for the arts and Waterford city.While there has been no allocation of funding in respect of community development projects in the aforementioned areas to date, the Deputy should note that pre-development work is under way. The full establishment of these groups as community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources and competing commitments within the programme. In the case of the CDP for the arts and Waterford city, I understand that the applications for inclusion in programme have yet to be assessed.Proposals under Strand II of the programme were recently received in my Department and are currently being examined with a view to progressing them as soon as possible.

In addition, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North will be allocating matching funding to the body in accordance with agreed relativities.While I regret the reduction that has been made in the provision for An Foras Teanga, this must be set in the context of the major increases in funding provided by the Government to this body in recent years – from €7.577 million in 2000 to €14 million in the current year.I am confident that An Foras Teanga will be able to continue to implement a full programme of work within the overall funding it will receive next year.

The programme encompasses three main measures, i.e., services for the unemployed, community development, and community based youth initiatives. There is a provision of €44.9 million in the Department's Vote for 2003 for this programme.While there is a reduction of approximately 6% in the allocation for this programme in 2003, the Deputy should be aware that ADM is actively working with partnerships and community groups to minimise the impact of the reduction on the provision of services next year. I am satisfied that the valuable work undertaken by partnerships and community groups will continue in 2003.

These cutbacks reflect the tight Estimate provision across Government Departments in response to the overall Government financial position. The Estimates this year meant that hard decisions had to be taken in some areas and clear priorities set by my Department.There will be a cut of approximately 6% in the subhead for the local development social inclusion programme in 2003. This programme is administered on behalf of the Department by ADM Limited and is delivered at local level by 38 area partnerships and 33 community groups located throughout the country. The programme encompasses three main measures i.e., services for the unemployed, community development, and community based youth initiatives.The reduction in funding available will result in some slowing down of the work of the partnerships during 2003. However, the Deputy should note that ADM are actively working with the partnerships with a view to minimising the impact of the cuts on the provision of services next year.On the drugs side, I am very happy there is an increase of 16% in the monies available for 2003. Problem drug use remains a major public policy issue and the Government is firmly committed to addressing this most serious and complex issue.The increase in expenditure for next year clearly reflects the Governments ongoing commitment to addressing the problem, particularly in areas where heroin misuse is most prevalent. The moneys available will primarily be used to implement proposals contained in the second round of plans prepared by the local drugs task forces. These plans, which were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion which is chaired by the Taoiseach, contain a range of proposals in the areas of treatment, prevention, awareness and rehabilitation.Given the financial pressures on the Department and in order to focus on resources available in the best possible way, it has been decided to discontinue the student summer jobs scheme in its present format. A number of partnership companies already have third level education initiatives targeted at the most disadvantaged and I will examine options in this regard.

Following the reports, the Department has advanced a number of measures to ensure best practice in relation to the award of contracts, the quality of services, and value for money for subsidised island transport services. These measures include: a management information framework being developed which will provide the Department with enhanced financial and non-financial systems and practices and quality management information; the appointment of independent assessors to critically review and validate each future tendering process; allocation of additional staff to the area so as to strengthen control and compliance with contract requirements; a specially designed software package which will enable more rigorous monitoring of the performance of all subsidised ferry operators; and an imminent competition for independent consultants to review other issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and to provide future performance indicators.The independent consultants I have just mentioned will review the ferry services to the Aran Islands as part of their brief. My Department hopes to convene a meeting of the steering committee for the project before Christmas and its first function will be to finalise the draft terms of reference.

This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.Since the commencement of the scheme of community support for older people in 1996, a total of €32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2001 has assisted some 89,136 individuals, and €4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.Under the terms of the scheme, grants for the following equipment are provided for: small scale physical security equipment such as, strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and door locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarms systems such as the panic button pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone. Funding is not available under the scheme for emergency lights. An independent review of the scheme was completed in 1999 and there are no plans to amend the terms of the scheme.

The fund aims to assist in the development of youth services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. The primary focus of the fund is the 14 local drug task force areas.Under the national development plan, €149.65 million has been approved for the fund in the period 200-06. To date, approximately €68 million has been allocated under round one of the fund. The national assessment committee of the young people's facilities and services fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups in the local drug task force areas under round two of the fund.

Priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through front-loading State resources, available under the national development plan.The programme also calls on Government Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. There are three strands of the RAPID programme: strand one targets 25 urban areas and strand two targets 20 provincial towns around the country. Rural RAPID operates under the name CLÁR in 16 rural areas.The allocation of specific staff to deal with the RAPID programme is a matter for individual Departments. However, the Deputy should note that a series of meetings at official level, between my Department and relevant Government Departments to discuss the implementation of the RAPID programme took place last July. From discussions at these meetings, I am satisfied that Departments have put in place sufficient staff resources to deal with the RAPID programme as outlined in the programme for Government.

My Department provided €840,820 to support the work of these teams in 2002.Projects included in RAPID plans are to be funded through front-loading of existing NDP resources. The Deputy will appreciate therefore, that it is a matter for individual Departments to report on allocations made to RAPID projects from within their financial resources.Proposals from strand I RAPID plans submitted to my Department fall to be considered under the young peoples facilities and services fund – YPFSF – the community development programme – CDP – and funding for the drugs initiative.In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, the position is that the national assessment committee of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round II of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting the completion of the external evaluation of the fund, which is due shortly, before seeking such proposals under round two.Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round two and in the light of the overall financial position for 2003. A number of proposals from RAPID plans are relevant to the drugs initiative, are being pursued through the local drugs task force plans. Eight priority areas for development of a community development project have been identified in the RAPID plans i.e., Loughlinstown, Shanganagh, Crumlin, Bluebell, Dolphin House, Inchicore, CDP for the arts and Waterford city.While there has been no allocation of funding in respect of community development projects in the aforementioned areas to date, the Deputy should note that pre-development work is under way in Loughlinstown, Shanganagh, Crumlin, Bluebell, Dolphin House and Inchicore. The full establishment of these groups as community development projects in 2003 is subject to available resources and competing commitments within the programme.In the case of the CDP for the arts and Waterford city, I understand that the applications for inclusion in programme have yet to be assessed. Proposals under strand two of the RAPID programme were recently received in my Department and are currently being examined with a view to progressing them as soon as possible.

The declaration, one of the key documents from the ministerial, outlines a wide-ranging work programme and is the blueprint for negotiations which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.Negotiations have already commenced in earnest across a broad range of issues. A substantial WTO negotiating structure is now in place including, at its pinnacle, the trade negotiation committee, TNC, designed to drive the Doha development agenda. The role of the TNC is to supervise the progress of the negotiations across the full spectrum including, in relation to trade-related issues in the areas of agriculture, services, trade related intellectual property rights, dispute settlement and trade and development. The European Communities and its member states are contributing substantially to the delivery of key outputs under the Doha work programme.Irish trade negotiators are fully engaged with and participate in these discussions at both EU and WTO fora. At this stage of the negotiations, preparations are being made for the conclusion of an initial end of year 2002 package of items including, access to medicines, implementation issues and special and differential treatment. Many of these issues are of particular interest to developing countries. In the new year, preparations will commence for the next trade ministerial in Mexico, in September 2003. This will, in effect, be a mid-term ministerial which will take stock of progress and give an overview of what has been accomplished at that stage in areas where negotiations have been launched.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	382	FÁS, the state agency with responsibility for training and employment services and which operates under the aegis of my Department, has accepted the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community and consequently Travellers are included on a range of FÁS programmes. In addition, there are a number of special initiatives, which have been developed in  response to approaches from Traveller support groups locally.Currently, there are community employment, CE, projects specifically dedicated to Travellers in Kerry, Limerick, Galway, Offaly, Meath, Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Waterford. At the beginning of October 2002, between these and other projects, there were some 230 Travellers participating on CE and a further 105 Travellers in FÁS training, mainly in community training workshops. There were approximately 790 Travellers on the FÁS employment service caseload, and a further 110 on the local employment service caseload.While Traveller representatives have already indicated to this Department that, for cultural reasons, Travellers prefer to be self employed, my Department has invited Traveller representative organisations to consider the various economic issues of interest, which fall within this Department's area of responsibilities. The outcome of this process may help clarify which issues can be addressed on a bilateral basis, and those which might benefit from wider considerations. The Department and agencies under its aegis will be fully supportive of the efforts of Travellers to adapt to, and participate in, the economy of a rapidly changing society.

This is unavoidable given the complexity of pensions issues generally but it is unfortunate that there still appears to a lot of incomplete and sometimes conflicting information circulating at present in relation to the position of the various schemes covering IFI employees. Nevertheless, it is understood that the funds do face potential difficulties, which in the case of Belfast, seem to be particularly serious. For a number of reasons, such as the different regulatory environment, the position of the schemes covering workers at the other locations may be somewhat better.

While the actual number of serving inspectors has fluctuated in the interim the inspectorate is now operating to full strength.Inspectors carry out night-time work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to the work of the enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. Targeted inspections by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels are a regular feature of the work of the inspectorate.During the years 2000 to date some 1,235 night-time inspections were undertaken while there were 3,421 day-time inspections during the same period. In addition, the employment rights information unit of my Department concluded a proactive awareness campaign earlier this year whereby all secondary schools were circulated with information on all aspects of employment law, including details of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. Staff of that unit also visit secondary schools, citizen information centres and other organisations to disseminate information on general labour law, including the protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.

This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement.My Department has now written to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to 2002 area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.One animal, which was slaughtered on 9 July 2002 was found to be eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme. Advance payment of €64 issued on 16 October in respect of this animal. Two further animals were slaughtered on 23 October 2002 for the person named. One of these animals is deemed eligible under the slaughter scheme and advance payment will issue in the coming weeks.

In the plan the Department undertakes to provide services through Irish on request from our customers and will seek to ensure that any such customer is not disadvantaged because of their choice. This is only one of 12 principles and 85 actions to which the Depart ment is committed over the period of the plan up to 2004.The Department is in the process of gathering data on the availability of its documents and services through both of the official languages and the level of competency in Irish amongst its staff members in order to develop a strategy on how best its commitments in this area can be fulfilled. The only direct costs recorded to date are those relating to training in the Irish language which amounted to €1,890 in this year and €482 in respect of translation services on the introduction to the Department's annual report for 2001. While at this stage of the process it is not possible to put an estimate on the final costs involved it is expected that expenditure on this will rise substantially over the next two years.

This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department has now written to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to 2002 area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.The person named submitted one special beef premium application for one animal under the 2002 scheme. An 80% advance payment totalling €120 issued on 16 October 2002, the first date for such payments in accordance with EU regulations.The person named has one animal eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme and national envelope top up. Advance payment issued on 16 October 2002 in respect of this animal for both of these schemes.

I am initiating this review to develop a cohesive national flooding policy that will deal with the growth and complexity of the flooding problem. The purpose of the review is to assess the extent of the problem countrywide, clarify roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved and to recommend practical action to deal with flooding. The review will be carried out by a group representing the major stakeholders – the Office of Public Works, Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government, local authorities, IBEC, and the IFA. The review group will receive submissions from, and consult with, a further wide range of relevant bodies, which will include the Insurance Industry Federation.

It had been intended to collect the amount underpaid over three years. However, the inspector of taxes will now arrange to extend the collection period to four years, i.e. the taxpayer's tax credits will be reduced so as to collect €512.66 in 2003 and €512.64 in each of the three subsequent years. There are no grounds in this case for extending the time for collecting the amount underpaid to more than four years.

The Government has concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would, however, have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. To mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.Total cancellation of HIPC debts should be accompanied by strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure the additional funds available to HIPC Governments, through debt cancellation, would be directly channelled into increased social expenditure, particularly HIV-AIDS.

I would envisage that some or all of their reports on the proceedings will be made available to the Department. These, together with the report from the Ambassador, will then be thoroughly reviewed.The Department, in providing consular assistance to the three men, has repeatedly expressed to the Colombian authorities the importance of ensuring that they receive a fair trial, that their safety is assured, that they are held in proper conditions and that they have adequate access to their legal representatives. I personally emphasised these points to the Colombian Foreign Minister when I met her in New York last September.The Department will continue to follow this case closely, and will also continue to provide every possible consular assistance to the men and to their families.

We remain fully committed to the court, in line with our political and legal obligations as a State Party to the Statute and under the EU Common Position of June 2002.I am aware of the positions of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in relation to bilateral agreements under Article 98.2 of the Rome Statute. These organisations are in regular contact with officials of my Department and maintain an ongoing and useful dialogue with EU member states on the International Criminal Court.The Government sees no prohibition within the Rome Statute itself to the adoption of certain types of bilateral agreement under Article 98.2 of the Statute provided that these are consistent with our legal and political obligations. In September 2002 the EU Council of Ministers agreed on guiding principles on what should be included in an agreement to be consistent with the Rome Statute and the existing EU Common Position. According to these guiding principles, any agreement should ensure that credible allegations are investigated and prosecuted, should cover only non-nationals of an ICC State Party and should cover only persons sent abroad in an official capacity by a State. These principles are designed to protect the integrity of the International Criminal Court and to offer clear guidance on the issue to EU Member states, to candidate countries and to other States Parties to the Rome Statute.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I propose to take Questions Nos. 221, 222 and 225 together.Security Council Resolution 1441, to which the Deputy refers, does not mandate military action against Iraq. The purpose of Resolution 1441 is to bring about the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, thereby averting any need for further action by the council. The resolution lays down procedures which would require the question of any Iraqi non-compliance to be considered by a further meeting of the Security Council. It would then be for the Security Council to assess whether Iraq has failed to meet its obligations, and to decide on any action which may be required. This decision might include authorising the use of force, although in the view of the Government this should be a matter of last resort.Ireland, like all other UN member states, is bound under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. If any resolution authorising the use of force were to be passed, it would be for the Government to decide what action should be taken, subject to any Constitutional or legal requirements to seek the approval or assent of the Dáil.Those circumstances do not arise at present. In determining Ireland's position, the Government is acting under Article 29.4 of the Constitution which provides that the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations be exercised by or on the authority of the Government. The Government will continue to act on this basis.

As regards the granting of overflight or landing permission, the Government will, at all times, act in accordance with its Constitutional and legal obligations.I would not foresee the EU Rapid Reaction Force as having a role in a military offensive against the Iraqi regime and its forces, even where such action was sanctioned by the UN Security Council. Such action would, in my view, be inappropriate to a force whose capabilities are primarily designed for humanitarian and crisis management tasks.

However, the current crisis with Iraq and the most recent UN Security Council resolution relate to the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction rather than to the continuing unsatisfactory human rights situation there.

It also recommended that each DPPB should be composed of a majority of elected councillors, the remaining independent members to be selected by the local council with the agreement of the policing board. As with the board, it was intended that each body would be broadly representative of the community in terms of religion, gender, age and cultural background. When the British Government accepted these proposals in principle, it indicated that the bodies would be called district policing partnerships (DPPs).These bodies are intended to be the key institutions for promoting community policing, and for delivering decentralised democratic accountability to policing at the local level. Because of its disproportionate size, four sub-groups of the DPP are to be established in the Belfast District Council area, representing north, south, east and west Belfast.Under the Police (NI) Act, 2000, DPPs are (i) to provide views to the local Police District Commander and to the Policing Board on any matter concerning the policing of the district, (ii) to monitor the performance of the police service in carrying out the policing plan in relation to the district, (iii) to make arrangements for obtaining the views of the public about local policing and for obtaining the co-operation of the public with the police in preventing crime and (iv) to act as a general forum for discussion and consultation on matters affecting the policing of the district.

The centre was established to offer courses to improve communication between the deaf and hearing communities and to enhance the employment prospects for members of the deaf community. An initial core function of the centre was to train qualified interpreters to address the shortage of skilled personnel in this field. The centre was established by Trinity College during 2001, with the first students being admitted in October 2001.The number of Irish Sign Language (ISL/English) interpreters in Ireland will more than treble from 20 to 65 interpreters over the first five years from the establishment of this centre. For the first time in Ireland, there is now an annual intake of students who will train as ISL tutors and interpreters. It also offers deaf students an opportunity to confidently experience third level education using ISL as their primary language for communication in the classroom.The proposal submitted by Trinity College to the Higher Education Authority in 1998 envisaged that the Centre for Deaf Studies would introduce three two-year full-time undergraduate diploma courses in ISL/English interpreting, design and delivery of ISL courses, and deaf studies. The first two of these courses were introduced in October 2001 and the third in October 2002. Each course has a quota of ten students but in view of the acute shortage of ISL/English interpreters 15 students were admitted to the interpreting course in its first year.I am not aware of any proposals to increase the number of places available on these courses.

Following this advice, my Department's post primary building unit informed the chief executive officer that it was not in a position to approve the proposal.In the circumstances, the now acting chief executive officer has been requested to put forward an alternative accommodation proposal for the school. A response is currently awaited.

In particular circumstances small portions of community and comprehensive schools sites are disposed off with the consent of the schools' trustees and management authorities. Typically, this occurs to align boundaries or to control access.Since 1999 the Minister for Education and Science may acquire a site for new schools. Clearly, there is no intent to dispose of any sites acquired for the purpose of building schools since that date.The Thurles campus of the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute remains vested in the Minister for Education and Science. North Tipperary County Council required approximately 1.25 acres of this land to widen a road adjacent to the campus. Legal contracts are currently being drawn up to finalise the sale.There are no plans to dispose of any of the remainder of the Thurles campus.

It contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment to models of service delivery, teacher training and structural reforms. The task force recognised that while some of its recommendations were amenable to short-term action, others would take longer to address.Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include:(1) the introduction of the first ever online training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia,(2) the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia, and(3) a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.In addition to the above measures, significant progress has been made on developing the structural and legislative framework necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the task force's recommendations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The National Educational Psychological Service Agency (NEPS) has been mandated by my Department to develop a psychological service that will eventually be available to all primary and post-primary schools. NEPS is organised in collaboration with the clinical services provided and funded by the health boards.Whilst NEPS keeps statistics on the reasons for referrals for psychological assessments, these are not available on a county by county basis. In relation to dyslexia, NEPS psychologists do not keep waiting lists in the sense of lists of named students who are seen in order. However, an important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. The length of time that a child has to wait for assessment will therefore depend upon the severity of the difficulty observed by the relevant teachers. NEPS psychologists also provide a consultation service and, in many cases, rather than assessing individual children, will give advice to teachers on appropriate programmes and methodologies that will help to overcome learning difficulties.The current situation is that practically all post-primary schools and roughly two thirds of primary schools have access to the NEPS service. Children in schools not yet served by NEPS may be assessed by psychologists from the Western Health Board or from voluntary bodies under its aegis. I am not in a position to provide detailed information about the health board services.

The project was given a capital allocation of some €44 million to develop the new facilities over the period 2000-06. There will be no expenditure on the capital elements of the project in 2003.The interim governing authority was launched by my predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, on 29 April to drive forward the establishment of an academy. The authority is chaired by Ms Carmel Naughton. It has 12 other members representing a wide range of experience and expertise to ensure the development of a world class third level institute for the education and training of performing artists in Ireland.The authority has met on three occasions since being appointed. It is actively engaged in progressing the work of the academy in both the recruitment process for its president and more generally its future development. To date some €43,976 has been spent on the work of the authority. This development work will continue in 2003 on the basis of the revenue budget available to the project.

The grant will be paid directly into schools' bank accounts by way of electronic funds transfer. The grant has traditionally been paid in two instalments, 70% in January and the remaining 30% in June each year.The main source of funding of the running costs of primary schools is the capitation grant. The standard capitation grant at primary level, which stood at £45 or €57.14 in 1997, was increased to €105 per pupil in the 2001-02 school year. The grant is being increased to €111.58 in respect of the 2002-03 school year. This represents an increase in the rate of grant of more than 95% in the period.I am satisfied the increases in the capitation grant referred to constitute a meaningful response to the need for increased funding for schools.

It replaced the previous process of the designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage.

The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 119 psychologists in NEPS in addition to a number of psychologists deployed elsewhere in the educational system, bringing the overall total up to almost 130.The Civil Service and Local Government Commissioners have established a panel of 69 psychologists who were successful in the most recent competition. Some 37 of these psychologists have entered the service since September 2002. My Department is making offers of employment to a further 13 psychologists who are expected to take up their posts later this year or during 2003. The 16 psychologists who remain on the panel should also be made offers of employment during 2003. A number of those appointed had previously been working in private practice.Since 1999, two psychologists have, sadly, died. Six others have left NEPS, three on retirement and three to take up employment elsewhere in the public service. It seems therefore that NEPS's ability to retain staff is not adversely affected by the private sector. However, NEPS has conducted a study of the demand and supply of educational psychologists in collaboration with the principal psychologists from Northern Ireland and will continue to keep the position under review.The employment and retention of speech and language therapists and of occupational therapists is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.

As announced at the time, the National Educational Welfare Board was appointed last year and the service will be phased in over a period of time. As this is a major new service with a new approach and new systems, it is not possible to be specific at this stage regarding the timeframe that the provision of the full service will entail. It is, however, the board's intention that in rolling out the new service, priority will be given to those children who are not in receipt of an education and to areas of high disadvantage.As in all other situations, it is a matter for each individual as to whether he or she might wish to take legal action in a certain set of circumstances.

The commission is required to carry out its functions in a manner, which it considers protects the interests of final customers. The commission also has a duty to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.On Monday, 25 November 2002, the EU Council of Ministers reached political agreement on the draft revised directive on the internal market in energy, the aim of which is to achieve full liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. The draft directive, which is expected to receive the approval of the European Parliament early in the new year, contains specific proposals aimed at ensuring a high level of protection for domestic consumers in all member states.When adopted, the directive will lead to increased competition, thereby ensuring greater choice for consumers. On a national level, the measures proposed in the draft directive will strengthen Ireland's link with the European gas network and ensure that gas undertakings operating in Ireland can gain access on regulated terms and tariffs to a wider range of markets and sources of supply.

As a result of these discussions FÁS, in consultation with SIPTU, established last year a procedure to identify suitably qualified personnel who wished to be considered for any specific vacancies for work both in the development of the Corrib field and in the Irish offshore. This procedure was advertised recently by FÁS last year in the national press and resulted in offers of employment to 38 personnel.Exploration and production companies employ Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators' Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities and I will continue to do so. In an address to the Institute of Petroleum on 6 November last, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, made it clear that the Government does not expect the industry to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where these are clearly uncompetitive, but the Government does, however, expect the industry to encourage and facilitate potential Irish suppliers to compete for the services required. Any company operating in Ireland for the long-term should see that it is in its best commercial interest to build strong links into the Irish economy and to demonstrate a significant economic and social dividend both at regional and national level.

However, in light of the Fethard tragedy, I announced my intention to bring forward the commencement date to 1 January 2003.I have agreed to meet the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers later today. I appreciate their concerns and those of angling clubs such as Dungarvan Sea Angling Club regarding the possible effects of the new regulations may have on sea angling festivals and competitions particularly where there may be difficulties in bringing old fishing vessels up to the required safety standard. However, as Minister, my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waterways. While sea angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms we cannot build our tourism industry on a poor safety regime. There is a long-term benefit to the tourism industry in being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling and I would urge sea angling clubs and festival organisers to avail of the boats that are already licensed.I have already informed the House that I have made available a once off grant of up to €20,000 to the IFSA towards the cost of acquiring licensed boats for the World Boat Angling Championships. The IFSA has also been informed that a boat licensed to operate in a particular area would be given the flexibility to operate in a different area solely for the purpose of a sea angling competition.

Artefacts in storage in the museum are used extensively for research purposes, particularly in the area of local and regional studies. The National Museum also operates a loans policy which allows original National Museum objects to be lent to museums which  meet the required standards of curatorship, security, environmental control, display and insurance.The Museum of Country Life in Turlough Park in County Mayo is a branch of the National Museum and was opened in 2001 in order to display the national folk-life collection. This new €19 million facility has afforded the National Museum the opportunity to display much of the museum's folk-life collection, previously held in storage due to lack of suitable exhibition space, in a setting appropriate to the collection. The quality of the Museum of Country Life has been recognised by the Gulbenkian Foundation with the Museum of the Year Award in 2002. This is the first newly commissioned building for the National Museum since 1890.

It is my intention to introduce new regulations in this area as soon as possible but at this stage I cannot give an exact date.With regard to licensed premises, current regulations only ban smoking in food preparation areas. Many pubs now provide a wide range of food services and there is a growing demand from the public for smoke-free areas in pubs and the licensed trade is aware of this. Surveys have shown that there is public support for extending controls on environmental tobacco smoke.A small number of pubs have introduced dedicated non-smoking areas on a voluntary basis. While this is welcome, I have made it clear to representatives of the licensed trade when meeting with them that much more needs to be done to afford the necessary level of protection for the public and staff from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. The draft regulations being prepared in my Department will include environmental controls on smoking in pubs and in restaurants.This is the first time public access areas in pubs are being regulated with regard to providing protection from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. The proposed regulations will provide for a ban on smoking in licensed premises when food is being served and dedicated non-smoking areas comprising 30% of the floor space at all other times. To provide improved protection for staff a ban on smoking at the bar counter in licensed premises will be included.

Arising from the work of the forum, I asked the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward taking into consideration the views of the representative groups that participated in the forum and also those that subsequently made submissions.The report, which I launched on 14 November, delivers on action 106 of the health strategy – quality and fairness – and makes a number of recommendations on proposals for the way forward, including the establishment of a working group to examine and consider regulatory issues in Ireland; the continuation and development of a consultation process; and support for individual therapies in developing or strengthening their systems of self-regulation.At the launch of the report, I announced the establishment of a national working group to progress the agenda set out in the report and to advise me on future measures for the appropriate regulation of complementary therapists.

For those with the condition who require hospitalisation, data are available from hospital in-patient enquiry HIPE system which records information on hospitalisations in all publicly funded acute hospitals.The following table provides the number of hospitalisations of children aged one to 15 years due to ulcerative colitis for 1995 to 2000. If patients are admitted more than once in a given year, each attendance is recorded separately in HIPE. It should be noted that the figures set out in the table are not comparable with those provided in the parliamentary question answered on 5 November 2002 as the age groups used differ slightly.Number of Hospitalisations of Children Aged 1 to 15 Years due to Ulcerative Colitis, 1995 to 2000

The report of the inquiry group concluded that a combination of errors, both human and of the systems involved, had contributed to the problem. The report made a number of recommendations, including the need for improvements in the receipt, tracking, testing and storage of samples at the pathology laboratory in Limerick Regional Hospital. A copy of the report was provided to the family on 16 March 2001. The Mid-Western Health Board has advised my Department that it is actively pursuing the implementation of all the recommendations contained in the report. Against this background I have no plans to initiate an inquiry on the lines suggested by the Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I have been informed by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the competent national authority for the regulation of medicinal products, that the sale of the product concerned from one shop in Dublin, and by mail order, is currently under investigation. I understand that the sale of the product has been stopped in both cases and that the publication of advertisements in a national newspaper has also ceased.I am advised that the product concerned does not have a product authorisation in Ireland, and therefore, may not be legally supplied to the public from a non-pharmacy retail outlet and without a prescription furnished by a registered medical practitioner. The IMB is continuing its investigation into this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council is the body statutorily charged with the registration of medical practitioners. In order to ensure patient care and safety it is necessary for the council to be absolutely certain of the suitability of a medical practitioner to be registered. In order to do this the Medical Council must satisfy itself as to the qualifications and good standing of any applicant for registration,  and insists on the provision of appropriate evidence that these requirements are met in the interests of patient safety.Persons wishing to practise as a registered medical practitioner in this country must apply to the Medical Council supplying relevant documentation upon which they are relying in making their applications for registration in the general register. I further understand from the council that one of the documents required is a recently dated certificate of good standing issued by the registration authority with which the doctor is currently registered. The certificate should certify that the doctor is registered and that no disciplinary action has been taken against him/her. Moreover, the certificate is verified by the council directly with the issuing registration authority in the country of origin except where that authority has sent the certificate directly to the council.The Medical Council has also advised me that there are registered medical practitioners whose names are entered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners maintained by the council but whose registered addresses are outside the country. Such doctors remain entitled to engage in the practice of medicine in this country, subject to their names remaining in the general register. Where information is received from registration authorities in the countries in which these doctors are practising, stating that disciplinary proceedings have resulted in erasure, or some restriction on their ability to practise freely has been imposed, this information is referred to the Fitness to Practise Committee for consideration under Part V of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The statutory provisions include that the council may apply to the High Court for an order suspending a doctor's registration where the public interest is considered to be at risk.The Lynott report, which I commissioned and published earlier this year, makes a number of recommendations to improve procedures for verifying the registration status of doctors who have previously been registered in another country. It recommends that appropriate checks be made by employers with regulatory bodies in countries in which a doctor was previously registered and this measure is now being introduced and will further ensure patient safety.Preparation of heads of Bill for a new Medical Practitioners Act is well advanced and the current statutory provisions in relation to the registration of medical practitioners are being carefully examined in this context. The Lynott report will be taken into consideration as part of this process.In addition, ensuring patient safety and consumer protection are key elements which must be addressed during the current negotiations on the proposed new European Council directive on the recognition of professional qualifications.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Approval for the appointment of a design team for the preparation of a development control plan for the whole hospital development was granted in August 2001. As the approval increased the scope of the phase 2B project to include indicative accommodation proposed in the design brief for construction in phases subsequent to 2B, the board's project team was requested to immediately review the design brief to reflect procurement of all phases under a single building con tract. The preparation of the revised design brief is at an advanced stage and should be formally submitted to the Department in the near future.Funding of €600,000 has been approved to progress the preparation of the development control plan in 2002. To date, funding has not been drawn down by the Midland Health Board from my Department.The additional hospital facilities to be provided in this phase 2B project are included in new accommodation, upgraded or refurbished accommodation and completion of shelled out phase 2A accommodation. The design brief requires that all elements of the project are designed, constructed and equipped to current best practice standards. The brief also requires that provision be allowed for future expansion of departments with minimal disruption to the functioning hospital.The phase 2B development will include the following: general medical beds; general surgical beds; day surgery department; day service-other non-surgical; operating department; pathology department; acute psychiatric department; child and adolescent psychiatric department; medical assessment unit; medicine for the elderly/rehabilitation department including day hospital; intensive care unit; coronary care unit; occupational therapy department; conference facilities; staff accommodation change-rest on call; catering facilities; administration facilities.Most of the additional beds at the hospital would be provided in the existing shelled out accommodation. The Midland Health Board has advised, that while the design process is at an early stage, completion of the existing shelled out ward accommodation is their priority in the project procurement process and the design team is being instructed to examine options which could allow a fastrack delivery of that element of the overall project.The projected expenditure for 2003 is €1 million approximately. Projected expenditure for the following two years is dependant on design solutions proposed by the design team in the development control plan DCP particularly in relation to the programme for completion of the shelled out accommodation. The Midand Health Board has advised that the DCP should be complete in spring 2003 and at that point it will be feasible to estimate the time frame for bringing on stream the additional beds.

There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with schizophrenia.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.

My Department has had ongoing discussions with all health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in relation to regional strategies to respond to the needs of children and adults who fall within this category over the last number of years.In addition to developing a significant number of additional residential, respite and day places over the last number of years, specific funding amounting to €11.42 million has also been allocated to the various health boards and to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in relation to the development, on an ongoing basis and in agreement with my Department, of specialist support services for adults and children who, because of their behavioural difficulties, require a more intensive level of support. This funding has been used to provide specific high support residential and respite places, multi-disciplinary and other therapeutic support services.The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot, at this stage, comment on specific funding for any element of the health services in 2003 prior to the conclusion of the annual budget discussions.

This review was carried out in consultation with local authorities and took account of representations received from a wide range of local interests.The need for changes to be made with regard to the classification of roads in the national or regional network is being kept under review, including in the context of the recently published national spatial strategy. Traffic patterns on the network will continue to be monitored in order to identify any long-term changes which might have implications for road classification.

The Great Southern Hotels Group is committed to accommodating the staff of the Torc either at the old Killarney Great Southern Hotel or with an agreed voluntary redundancy package. I do not propose to intervene in this matter.There are no proposals at this time for the sale of any other hotel in the Great Southern Hotels Group. I intend to revisit the question of the appropriate ownership of the Great Southern Hotels Group in due course. For the time being, however, my priorities in aviation policy derive from An Agreed Programme for Government.

It was envisaged in the strategy that the system would support road safety by tracking a range of motoring offences that have a direct impact on road safety.The Road Traffic Act, 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the penalty points system, reflects that approach. The Act identifies 69 offences to which the system applies. All of these are directly related to road safety. The system has already been introduced in respect of speeding offences with effect from 31 October 2002. I expect that the full implementation of the system will be achieved by the end of 2003.The penalty points system will be kept under review as it becomes fully operational and having regard to the forthcoming road safety strategy. The question of extending the system to cover parking offences such as illegal parking in disabled persons' parking spaces would have to be justified on grounds of road safety.

The limitation on holders of provisional licences driving on a motorway prohibits the holders of such licences from driving on the motorways but does not prohibit them receiving instruction from driving instructors who are carrying out the driving.The driving test is designed to assess the general competence of a person to drive. Passing the test is not the end of the learning process and persons should continue to build up their experience in driving in different traffic, weather and road conditions, including driving on motorways. Irish practice in relation to driving instruction on motorways is in line with the position in Northern Ireland and the UK generally. Information in respect of the position in EU member states regarding the matter of driving instruction on motorways is not readily available in my Department.

This issue subsequently was examined by the public inquiry into the Tallaght to Abbey Street line as part of the railway works order process. The inquiry concluded that the decision to use European gauge size was the correct one.The Luas and Iarnród Éireann rail services run in different environments with entirely different characteristics and components, i.e. light rail systems can operate at street level while conventional rail systems are segregated from the road. However, interchange of Luas with Iarnród Éireann services will be facilitated through the development of appropriate facilities where the systems interchange and through the development of integrated ticketing and passenger information systems.

The increased cost of the programme and the changed economic and budgetary circumstances combined with some delays, due partly to land access difficulties in 2001 affecting planning, have impacted on the pace of implementation of the programme. Some projects will, therefore, take longer to implement than planned.Nevertheless, it is hoped that with many projects reaching completion in 2003 and with the advance of PPP projects, a number of schemes will be able to commence next year. The selection of schemes for commencement will be a matter for the NRA.The provision of over €1 billion for the national roads programme in 2003 will ensure that investment will be maintained at a high level and that good progress will continue to be made in upgrading the national roads network.

In accordance with the national development plan, all buses purchased by both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann since 2000 for use on urban services are low floor  and wheelchair accessible. In pursuing this policy Bus Átha Cliath now operates 367 low floor wheelchair accessible buses on its Dublin city services. This represents almost 35% of the city fleet and some 35 bus routes in Dublin now have fully accessible services.Following a comprehensive bus replacement programme in recent years, Bus Éireann's entire regular urban fleets in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford comprise low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles. In addition, the company is testing twenty low-floor wheelchair accessible buses on a number of rural routes and six low floor buses on the Ashbourne-Dublin commuter route. I understand that Bus Éireann is continuing to monitor developments in relation to the design and manufacture of long distance coaches with regard to improving the company's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments on their inter-urban services.Iarnród Éireann's DART and Arrow suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network. The Enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and all inter-city rail services using the more modern rolling stock are also accessible. A number of older rail carriages are not wheelchair accessible and most of these will be phased out over the next three years or so as new wheelchair accessible rolling stock comes on line. The new rolling stock, which will be designed to meet the most up to date accessibility standards, will begin to enter into service from early next summer.There is an ongoing programme in place to provide either ramps or lifts at rail stations to make platforms more accessible for the mobility impaired and other accessibility improvements are also undertaken when bus and rail stations are being developed or refurbished.

In addressing the specific needs of people with disabilities, one of the overall objectives of the revised NAPS is "to increase the participation of people with disabilities in work and in society generally and to support people with a disability, and their families, to lead full and independent lives". An increased participation by students with disabilities at third-level, to 1.35% by 2003 and 1.8% by 2006, and improved access to planned respite care for carers of disabled people by 2003, are two aims of the strategy.A key objective emanating from the NAPS, which is overseen by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is to develop appropriate baseline data to assist in the establishment of targets and the development of future appropriate measures to address social exclusion for people with disabilities. More generally, the social partnership process provides a means for Government to ensure that the concerns of many and varied interests are taken into account when legislation is being formulated.

For example, the number of non-EEA nationals registered with the Garda Síochána in 2001 was 90,446. This represents a 92% increase on the number registered in 2000, which was 47,262. The figures for 1999 and 1998 were 29,646 and 22,546, respectively. In addition, the division has to provide certain services for persons who wish to travel to the State – 32,000 visa applications in 2001 – as well as asylum see kers and other classes of immigrants within the State.The division, which includes the visa office, recently relocated to new premises in Burgh Quay. As part of this relocation a new telephone system was installed with a view to improving access to the division through designated helplines, along with the provision of recorded information messages which should reduce the need to speak to an operator. In the interests of better customer service and more efficient use of staff time, a decision was made to try to minimise time spent on phone calls and maximise the time available for decision-making.If a person makes a call to the division on either (01) 6167700 or locall 1890 551 500, the caller will get through to an automated message service giving them several options depending on the nature of the query and an option to get through to a switchboard operator. There are a number of helplines in operation which can only be accessed through either of the above numbers within their respective hours of operation. These helplines and their respective hours of operation are as follows: visas on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.; general immigration daily, from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; citizenship on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. There have been some technical difficulties with the new telephone system which are being addressed between my Department and the service provider.

Irish citizens are not subject to immigration control. Furthermore, it is open to any person who has been legally resident in the State for more than ten years to apply to the immigration and citizenship division of my Department for permission to remain in the State without condition as to time. This obviates the necessity for renewal of permission to remain at Garda registration offices.

This is broken down between the Dublin metropolitan region –€30,226; other regions –€49,569; and the Garda National Immigration Bureau for both days –€21,569. It is my firm view that it is entirely appropriate that taxpayers' money be spent on the enforcement of our immigration laws. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they consider that Oper ation Hyphen was a success in that 16 persons wanted for deportation were apprehended, a number were charged with offences before the District Court and a number who were here illegally are believed to have left the State voluntarily. As a result of the operation there has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-EEA nationals who are registering at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and at local Garda registration offices as they are required to do under the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended. Accordingly, I am satisfied that this was an appropriate use of taxpayers money.The enforcement of immigration law is an operational matter for the Garda authorities. Accordingly, it is a matter for the Garda authorities to determine whether and when similar operations should be carried out in the future.

It also recommended that each DPPB should be composed of a majority of elected councillors, the remaining independent members to be selected by the local council with the agreement of the policing board. As with the board, it was intended that each body would be broadly representative of the community in terms of religion, gender, age and cultural background. When the British Government accepted these proposals in principle, it indicated that the bodies would be called district policing partnerships, DPPs.These bodies are intended to be the key institutions for promoting community policing, and for delivering decentralised democratic accountability to policing at the local level. Given its disproportionate size, four sub-groups of the DPP are to be established in the Belfast District Council area, representing north, south, east and west Belfast. Under the Police (NI) Act, 2000, DPPs are first, to provide views to the local police district commander and to the policing board on any matter concerning the policing of the district; second, to monitor the performance of the police service in carrying out the policing plan in relation to the district; third, to make arrangements for obtaining the views of the public about local policing and for obtaining the co-operation of the public with the police in preventing crime; and, fourth, to act as a general forum for discussion and consultation on matters affecting the policing of the district.

Allowing for normal remission, he will be due for release in May 2018. In accordance with the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, the person was specified by my predecessor in November 2000 to be a qualifying prisoner for the purposes of the Good Friday Agreement. The case was subsequently referred to the Release of Prisoners Commission for its advice in accordance with the Act. The commission forwarded its recommendations on this case to my office on 31 July 2002. I am now finalising my consideration of this person's case, including the commission's recommendations, and will make a decision on the matter shortly.

Road traffic legislation and any changes thereon are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the vehicle in question, which was partially blocking the driveway of the person concerned, has been removed by the owner. I understand that the difficulties encountered by the Garda Síochána in tracing the owner of the vehicle were due to the fact that the vehicle had undergone many changes of ownership in recent months.

As the Deputy may be aware, persons serving life sentences for murder may have their case reviewed by the Interim Parole Board after they have served seven years in custody.The board was established in April 2001 to advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the administration of long-term prison sentences and replaces the work previously carried out by the Sentence Review Group. The board, by way of recommendation to the Minister, advises of the prisoner's progress to date, the degree to which he or she has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of this sentence. I consider in full all recommendations put before me by the Interim Parole Board before making the final decision regarding sentence management.

Five cases were detected and proceedings commenced in two of these cases. One case resulted in a conviction. During the same period, proceedings were taken in 12 non-headline offences under section 2 of the 1989 Act, resulting in a further three convictions. The Garda authorities, conscious of the importance of the recording and monitoring of racist incidents, have, since October of this year, through the PULSE system, put in place a mechanism to record and gather information on racist incidents and offenders nationwide. The review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, is ongoing at my Department. This review is being carried out in co-operation with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism.In 2001, the Council of Europe established a committee on criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks. Ireland participated in this committee, which drew up a draft protocol to the convention on cybercrime on this issue. This protocol was adopted by the Committee of Ministers in November, 2002 and will be opened for signature in early 2003. In November, 2001, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. Negotiations on the Framework Decision are at an advanced stage.The review being carried out by my Department is a comprehensive one, involving many issues. I consider it appropriate to await the outcome of these negotiations, before finalising the review of our existing legislation. The final texts of both instruments will be considered, to fully assess their implications in the context of the legislative review.

No information is available regarding the circumstances of such persons after their deportation. There are no plans to develop such a mechanism. However careful consideration is given beforehand to each individual case in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. That Act requires that before I make a deportation order in respect of a person I must consider a range of 11 personal  circumstances, including the age of the person, the duration of their residence in the State, the family and domestic situation, humanitarian considerations and any representations made by the person or on their behalf. Furthermore, section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, must be considered in every case. This provides for a prohibition of refoulement where it is considered unsafe to return persons. I have extensive and up to date country of origin information available to me which is consulted in determining the safety of returning individuals.

I am further informed that from 1 January 2001 to 2 December 2002, 542 heavy goods vehicles have been reported stopped by members of the Garda Síochána for breaching the three tonne limit on Kennelsfort Road and that, over the same period, 168 prosecutions have either been finalised or are in progress.I understand that heavy goods vehicles exceeding the three tonne limit may lawfully enter the Kennelsfort Road for the purpose of gaining access to or egress from premises accessible only from that road, e.g., to deliver goods to Palmerstown shopping centre or the Cherry Orchard industrial estate. As a consequence, goods vehicles entering or exiting the Kennelsfort Road are not necessarily in breach of the relevant regulations.

This agreement was approved by Dáil Éireann on 28 March 2002. I inform the Deputy that these contacts primarily concern arrangements to facilitate the repatriation of Nigerian nationals who are not eligible to reside in the State, including the issue of Nigerian travel documents and the making of travel arrangements.As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, it is internationally recognised that organised criminal gangs are heavily involved in people smuggling and this applies whether the intended purpose of the person in question is illegal immigration or the making of a claim for asylum. Nigeria is no different in that regard to a wide range of other source countries.

The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committees have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. The committees also submit annual reports to me which are subsequently published.

The trend in giving lectures has evolved to addressing larger groups of people, thus allowing for efficiency in use of resources. Lectures are only one means of communicating relevant information by the gardaí to the public. The Garda Síochána also addresses a large numbers of listeners on relevant drug related issues through local radio in counties Kildare, Carlow and Wicklow. In addition, a mobile unit was used in the division for one week during the year by crime prevention officers to address crime prevention and drug abuse issues in the area. The mobile unit was set up in a prominent place in a different town each day.

Authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix waste of waste treatment facilities which, at a regional level, would maximise recovery of materials or energy and minimise environmental emissions at reasonable cost. Against this background, regional waste management plans were adopted which provide, inter alia, for waste minimisation, materials recycling, biological treatment of organic wastes, thermal treatment with energy recovery and landfill of residual wastes that cannot otherwise be recovered.

Matters relating to the dual mandate were among these raised and discussed with me on 24 October 2002 by a deputation from the General Council of County Councils.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I propose to take Questions Nos. 394 and 398 together.My Department does not have data on average prices for three bedroom semi-detached houses on the basis sought in the question. However, information on overall average house prices in respect of the five cities and the country as a whole, is published on a quarterly and annual basis in my Department's housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The Department has issued a request for tenders for a new computer system which will expand the range of data collected and analysed on house prices, and this system is expected to be implemented during the course of 2003.With regard to the acquisition of houses in different local authority areas through shared ownership or local authority annuity loans, I would point out that the implementation and management of the shared ownership scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for each housing authority concerned. In operating the scheme, local authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining maximum price limits or any other conditions they believe appropriate. These issues are best determined by the individual local authorities.The objective of the shared ownership scheme is to enhance housing affordability by allowing applicants to purchase part only of the equity of the dwelling (at least 40%) and to rent the remaining share from the local authority. The present maximum loan of €130,000 operated by local authorities for the purposes of the shared ownership scheme would on this basis enable the purchase of houses exceeding present average prices, subject to the ability of applicants to manage the mortgage and rented commitments involved.The maximum annuity loan of €130,000 also allows allow significant numbers of low income households to purchase their own homes. However, my Department is keeping the loan limits that apply to local authority house purchase loans, including annuity, affordable and shared ownership under review.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The only reliable source of data on the number of persons living in rented accommodation throughout the country is the housing module contained in the census of population conducted by the Central Statistics Office every ten years. The most recent such data is contained in the 1991 census. The CSO has not yet analysed the housing data from the 2002 census forms.It is provisionally estimated that about 25,000 of the 48,413 households assessed as in need of local authority housing in the March 2002 local authority social housing needs assessment are residing in the private rented sector. There is no data available on the number of people living in the private rented sector who are not on the waiting lists and are unable to purchase a home. There are, of course, people residing in the private rented sector who would be in a position to purchase a home but do not choose to do so.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Government's strategy to increase housing supply has delivered record levels of overall housing output in successive years, enabling us to meet demand and improve affordability, particularly for first-time purchasers. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective. Total new house completions in 2001 was over 52,600 units, an increase of 5.6% on 2000 and the seventh consecutive year of record housing output. The indications available to me suggest that new housing output will be in or around record figures again this year.

Approved applicants will be eligible for the new house grant provided they meet the conditions of the scheme, and where: (a) the applications for grants were approved by my Department prior to 14 November 2002; or (b) the applications were received in my Department on or before 14 November 2002 but were not yet approved; or (c) a local authority notifies my Department on or before 4 December 2002 that  a written offer of an affordable house had been made to an affordable housing applicant on or before 14 November 2002.In all cases, it will be a requirement of grant payment that the house is completed and occupied and a request for payment of a new house grant lodged with the Department within a year i.e. on or before 13 November 2003. New house grants will not be paid in any other circumstances. Approved applicants under the affordable housing scheme who will not be eligible for the new house grant may avail of a lower deposit of 3% rather than 5% of the sale price.

In addition, people who had already made commitments in the form of signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations on or before 14 November 2002 have been given an opportunity to apply for the grant. In providing a grace period up to 4 December for cases such as these to notify my Department, first time buyers who are at the most advanced stage of purchase or building are being facilitated as far as possible. The payment of a booking deposit which is subject to contract does not constitute a contract and is therefore excluded from the above arrangements.

A tenant purchase scheme is not desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector here as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.Residents of more than one year's duration of houses provided under the voluntary housing schemes who wish to become owner occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved voluntary housing body, qualify for the following benefits: special mortgage allowance of €11,450 over five years for mortgages created on or after 1 January 2002 to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme, without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites scheme and exemption from the income limits for local authority loans. Full details of these options are available from local authorities.Management and maintenance of dwellings provided under the schemes is the responsibility of the relevant voluntary housing body. In accordance with the terms and conditions for management and letting, approved housing bodies are the owners and have the responsibility for the proper management of their dwellings, adequate repairs and maintenance systems to ensure the preservation of the dwellings and compliance with all relevant statutory regulations. Tenants are often involved through management committees in the management and upkeep of projects, particularly communal areas. However, they are not responsible for refurbishment of their dwellings.

However, the issues raised by the group will be borne in mind in any future review. Compliance with the individual requirements of the Act and regulations is properly the responsibility of the local authority concerned.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The grant application to undertake a PPP feasibility study on the provision of car parking and ancillary facilities in the town, submitted by Sligo Corporation in November 2000, included a reference to the need for consultation with stakeholders and the community. This accorded with guidance provided by my Department to local authorities that contracting authorities should undertake consultation and communication when developing a public private partnership project.My Department has yet to receive a copy of the consultants' report, which I understand has been presented in draft form to the council. Once the study has been finalised and the report submitted to my Department for consideration, we will assess whether the core elements of the study's terms of reference, and stakeholder concerns, have been adequately addressed.

As no further information has been received from Cork County Council in the interim the position is unchanged.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to Ballyhaunis and the Ballyhaunis town water supply scheme are currently under construction under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2002-04. The extension of the Lough Mask scheme, which will replace the source that was the subject of the recent boil water notice, is due for completion by mid 2003. The improvements to the towns storage and distribution systems are due to be completed before the end of 2003.Local authorities are responsible for dealing with incidents that may threaten individual public drinking water supplies and my Department has issued comprehensive guidelines to assist authorities in this regard. In accordance with the guidelines, Mayo County Council informed my Department that it had issued the boil water notice in Ballyhaunis on 1 November 2002. Notification of the lifting of the notice was received from the council last week.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	604	Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 2001, introduced a new right of public access to meetings of local authorities – city, county and town councils – restricting the right to meet in private. Regulations made under section 54 of that Act also permit public access to meetings of committees and joint committees of local authorities, subject to certain exclusions.These provisions do not extend to other separate statutory bodies such as the Lough Corrib Navigation Trustees. My Department understands that meetings of the trustees are governed by their own standing orders which do not provide for public access.My Department is not primarily involved in the administration of the Lough Corrib Navigation Act, 1945, and, consequently, cannot offer clarification on the extent of the area in which the trustees exercise functions or other such matters deriving from this legislation.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	605	A preliminary proposal for sewerage works in Ardfert has been submitted to my Department as part of a grouped scheme to refurbish a number of small sewerage schemes in County Kerry but has not been approved. The grouped scheme was included in the list of 24 water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kerry County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-04, published in April 2002. Because of the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme. It would, however, be open to the council to consider advancing the Ardfert scheme under the devolved rural water programme.

The scheme enables local authorities to grant aid necessary adaptation works to a house to meet the needs of a disabled person.Significant improvements have been made to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme in recent years with a doubling of the effective maximum grant from €10,158 in 1997 to €20,320 currently. In addition, the grant now covers 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds in 1997. The recoupment rate from my Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid has also increased, from 50% to two-thirds, and a disabled persons new house grant of up to an effective maximum of €12,700 has been introduced.I have no proposals, at this stage, to change the terms and conditions of disabled persons grant scheme but these will continue to be kept under review.

They were examined in my Department and the local authority was advised recently that the applications, as submitted, could not be approved. My Department's main concerns relate to the condition, standard  and cost of the properties proposed to be acquired.Leitrim County Council was informed at the same time that officials from my Department would be willing to meet those of the local authority and the voluntary body to discuss issues regarding these applications.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The implementation of housing loan schemes such as the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes are matters for individual local authorities. To be eligible for either scheme applicants must satisfy the local authority that they are in need of housing and their income satisfies the income test such that in the case of a single income household gross income does not exceed €32,000 and in the case of a two income household, such that two and a half times the gross income of the principal earner plus once the gross income of the subsidiary earner does not exceed €80,000, or a person whose application for local authority housing has been approved by the local authority, or a local authority tenant or tenant purchaser who wishes to buy a private house and to return their present house to the local authority, or a tenant for more than one year of a house provided by a voluntary body under the rental subsidy scheme who wishes to buy a private house and return their present house to the voluntary body.Persons working legally under a work permit may be considered for a loan under either scheme provided they meet the criteria outlined above.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I understand that the comments from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul related to general levels of personal credit, and not, as reported, to home repossessions. The overall level of repossessions has declined in recent years. According to data published by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association (IMSA), a representative organisation for mortgage lenders in Ireland, mortgage arrears have declined steadily from 1995 to date. The number of properties taken into possession by IMSA members remains extremely low, and total repossessions have fallen from 193 in 1995 to 25 in 2001. While the IMSA have not published figures for 2002, indications to date are that repossession levels will be slightly lower than in 2001.According to the Irish Bankers Federation which also represents the retail banking sector, figures for repossession of homes by banks remain negligible.

My Department is responsible for seven of these projects. Three fall under the remit of the young peoples facilities and services fund or YPFSF and the other four projects fall to be considered under the community development project or CDP.In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, the national assessment committee of the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is examining capital proposals submitted by the development groups under round II of the fund. With regard to services projects, the committee is awaiting the completion of the external evaluation of the fund, which is due shortly, before seeking such proposals under round II. Proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.

To date I have met the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will arrange meetings with each of the other Departments over the coming months.One of the principal mechanisms for advancing progress on cross cutting issues will be the interdepartmental committee on rural, community and Gaeltacht affairs. The main purpose of the committee is to provide a forum for the resolution of issues relevant to this Department's remit where such issues impinge on the responsibilities of other Departments. Of course, as is the norm, informal contact between my Department and other Departments on a range of issues takes place on a regular basis.In relation to decisions affecting the quality of life for those in either urban or rural areas, my Department was represented on the steering committee which drafted the national spatial strategy. I was also a member of the Cabinet committee which considered the draft strategy. I am satisfied that my Department's views were taken into account in finalising the published strategy.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	625	My Department provides supports to local self help and community development initiatives through a range of once off grant schemes and long-term funding programmes. The schemes are aimed at helping people to develop the confidence and the capacity to participate as partners alongside statutory agencies and others in local development initiatives; to concentrate on a wide range of support for local self help groups and community development; and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.To be eligible for funding groups must subscribe to a self help, community development ethos and must involve the intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. The schemes are aimed at developing people and their capacity to participate in society, rather than at the provision of services or at direct economic development or job creation initiatives.The once-off grant schemes operated by the Department to support community development and family support groups are as follows. Under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, once off grants may be made to help voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas. The grants may be made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once off publications or research or other special projects. Grants towards wages or salaries or other running costs are not available under this scheme.The scheme of grants to locally based community and family support groups provides grants to locally based community and family support groups involved in programmes of self help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life. The range of projects undertaken includes home management programmes, advice services, self development programmes, community education, foundation and pre-vocational skills courses, skills development, young parents groups, projects for women affected by family violence, projects for marginalised men, Travellers projects, leadership skills, community development and "first step" courses leading to personal and community development.The purpose of the community development education and training grants scheme is to fund training and education initiatives aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of local community and voluntary groups, for example, programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees and others active in community and voluntary organisations. Examples of the types of training eligible include management/organisational development, social analysis, media skills and analysis and leadership skills.

I am fully confident that my Department will function successfully and that it will achieve its priority objectives.The Estimates process presented me with the opportunity to critically examine my Department's collective spending programmes, which were previously spread around the Votes of various Departments. This was a useful exercise in the effort to set clear priorities although, of course, some difficult decisions have to be made.I am confident that the 2003 allocations to Gaeltacht schemes, na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin, cultúrtha agus sóisialta agus tithe Gaeltachta, will be sufficient to meet expected demand. In the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta, while its current allocation has been increased, there is a reduction in its capital. However, I believe that the capital allocation is adequate to meet the needs for industrial grants and the planned building programme, especially in the light of the likely level of demand and the potential resources that can be generated by an túdarás. Furthermore, the allocation to na hoileáin has been increased by 9% for 2003.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The report in question is a valuable piece of research carried out by the housing unit and Dublin City Council into the circumstances of households accommodated by the council in 2001. The report provides valuable data in such areas as household composition, sources and levels of income and employment levels. It also draws attention to the position of groups which are vulnerable to poverty, including one parent families, children and the elderly. The report is part of a research programme being undertaken by the housing unit which is designed to inform its work in public housing management.Studies of this type are also valuable in supplementing the data available from broader national surveys and enhance the capacity of policy makers at both local and national levels to address key issues in relation to poverty and social inclusion. In this regard the report identifies income poverty as a serious issue for the households concerned with particularly high levels among tenant households with children and members of tenant households aged 65 years and over. The revised national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, sets out targets which aim to address a number of the issues highlighted in the report. The findings of the report will be taken on board in the context of moving ahead with the implementation of the strategy.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The living alone allowance, which amounts to €7.70 per week, is payable to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone. It is not a payment in its own right but an allowance which can only be paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of the UK or other countries. Proposals to change the current eligi bility arrangements would have to be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The proportion of voice and data fixed line budget which is allocated to my Department's main supplier is 92%.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance since February 2000. Following a review of her entitlement her claim was disallowed from 26 June 2002 on the grounds that her means, derived from her spouse's income from self employment, exceeded the statutory limit for receipt of this payment.She appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and an appeals officer has decided that an oral hearing is necessary. This is being arranged for the next occasion that an appeals officer will be in the area. The appeals office will be in touch with the person concerned in this regard in the near future.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

To benefit under the dental benefit scheme, patients must obtain treatment from a dentist who is operating the treatment benefit scheme. Under this scheme, the Department pays the dentist on the basis set out in the contract for dental treatment and the patient pays the difference, if any, which the contract allows.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	635	My Department acknowledges the rights of our customers to service through Irish and efforts are being made to provide such a service and to make our customers aware that they are available to them. Our policy in relation to the use of Irish is informed by the Principles of Quality Customer Service which were adopted by the Government in 2000, the impending Official Languages (Equality) Bill due to be enacted in 2003 and the Department's Customer Action Plan 2001-04.Providing quality customer service in Irish includes various elements such as the translation of forms and leaflets, facilitating the training of staff in spoken and written Irish and providing bilingual signs in public areas. While expenditure in relation to these various aspects has occurred, it is not possible in all cases to separate the costs from other costs, for example, expenditure on design, printing, and advertising.The main areas where it is possible to identify costs in relation to Irish are in translation and training. Costs for translation of forms and leaflets have amounted to €12,150 since July 2002. Irish language training has cost €7,268 since July 2002.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	636	Efforts to resolve the dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association have continued since the commencement of the association's action of advising dentists to impose increased charges on patients in breach of their contractual arrangements under the scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-03 00:00:00	Prelude	637	The numbers of people availing of the back to work allowance scheme have been falling steadily in recent years due to the continued buoyancy of the labour market and the low levels of long-term unemployment. Recent studies have found that successes in entering into employment should have occurred anyway, over 50%, even in the absence of the scheme.In the light of these studies and of current labour market conditions it has been decided to restructure the scheme to target those in most need in accessing the labour market, specifically the very long-term unemployed, lone parents and people with a disability. The details of this restructuring are being finalised at present and will be announced shortly.
