I hope the Tánaiste will raise this issue for me.  Viva Ché.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Any privatisation or disposal of State assets under the McCarthy report would entail legislation.  Given various personal statements made outlining the opposition of members of the Government party to the sale of Bord na Móna, Coillte and a number of other State companies, can the Tánaiste assure us that we will not see legislation to dispose of these assets?The Taoiseach referred this week to the proposed constitutional convention.  It has been recent custom in this House for measures relating to the Constitution to be subject to all-party discussion prior to publication.  The Taoiseach indicated that the convention is to be a cross-party, cross-community entity, like us in Dáil Éireann, although we apparently are not fit to constitute ourselves as such a convention.There are two Ministers who cannot be held accountable by the House for their actions.  Fianna Fáil has placed a notice of motion to address this position immediately instead of waiting for legislation, which would allow the Minister for public expenditure and reform to answer questions on Thursday, 5 May and the Minister for children on Tuesday, 10 May.

The contents of the report will be considered by the Government and if any proposals arise from it that require legislation, such legislation will be brought before the House.It is intended there will be all-party discussions on the proposals for the constitutional convention, which will take place when the Government has given further consideration to it.A Ministers and secretaries (amendment) Bill will provide for the formal establishment of the Departments of the two Ministers to whom Deputy Lenihan would like to address questions.  It is at an advanced stage and will be before the House shortly after we resume.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	We have been promised statements the week we return from the Easter recess on the revised memorandum of understanding.  The revised memorandum has not been published and although it is being discussed in Washington, Frankfurt and God knows where else, Members of this House have not had sight of it.  Instead we have been drip-fed elements of the discussions the Government has had with the troika.From the comments from the Minister for public expenditure and reform this morning, it is clear one of those conversations has been about the disposal of State assets.  Judging by the Minister's comments this morning, it is clear the Government is now prepared to go down the cul-de-sac of selling State assets in a bid to pay bank and bondholder debts.  Is the Government in the course of yet another U-turn, whereby the proceeds of the privatisation programme will not find their way into stimulus and investment in jobs but will, in accordance with the views of the IMF and EU, be used for debt writedown?When will the revised memorandum of understanding be published?  Will Members of this House see it in advance of the debate next week?  Can the Tánaiste give any assurance, as the leader of the Labour Party, that he has not bought wholesale into the Fine Gael-led agenda of flogging the family silver to bail out the very wealthy?

The EU-IMF programme will be debated for two days in the House when it returns from the Easter recess.  The memorandum of understanding will be published when it is completed.  It has not yet been completed.As stated earlier, we were presented with a report on the sale of State assets by the McCarthy group.  That report will be considered by the Government and by individual Departments.  If any decisions are made on foot of the report, they will be brought before the House.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Will the Tánaiste be much more precise with regard to the timetable he envisages in respect of this matter, including that part of it which relates to legislative issues?  Will he correct the misleading impression that this sale has something to do with job creation when the EU-IMF deal provides that the money will disappear into the black hole that is European bankers' debts?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The Deputy can make those points during the debate.

The comment by the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, to the effect that there will not be a delay relates to making a decision on these matters.  This Government's approach is that it makes decisions as quickly as possible.  I am sure Deputy Higgins would agree that it is important to have a Government which is decisive.When Deputy Higgins has an opportunity to read the report he will discover that it is clear that there should not be a fire sale of State assets.  He will also find that there is a requirement in any event for regulatory changes to be made in respect of State assets and agencies, irrespective of whether such assets are held by State bodies or whether they are disposed of.  Obviously, that is a matter which much be addressed.  The issue of disposing of State assets, if and when it arises, will only be considered in the light of market conditions.  I reassure Deputy Higgins that nobody is in any rush to dispose of State assets.  If there is any disposal of State assets to be addressed, a decision on that will be made by the Government.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	51	It should not even be on the agenda.

Unlike previous speakers, I will certainly comply with Standing Orders.Will the Tánaiste indicate when the Central Bank (supervision and enforcement) Bill will be published?  It is obvious that supervision within the financial sector was, to say the least, lacking in recent years.  I appreciate that a number of measures have been put in place in the context of merging various units and providing and enhancing supervisory functions.  In light of the current crisis and the climate which obtains, will the Tánaiste indicate when the Bill to which I refer will be brought before the House?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Preparation of the heads of the Central Bank (supervision and enforcement) Bill — the purpose of which is to provide for enhancement of financial regulation and expand the supervisory and enforcement powers of the Central Bank — is at an advanced stage.

It recommends asset stripping of this country which would involve the sale of vital State assets and companies — by any definition, these are strategic assets — to pay off the bankers, gamblers and speculators.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am not sure if the Deputy heard me direct him to ask a question on promised business.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Yesterday the Taoiseach stated that he has agreed with each member of Government his or her priorities for this Administration's first 100 days in office, including legislation to be published.  The legislative programme published by the Government does not refer to the legislation involved in this regard.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The programme for Government makes much mention of legislation for the creation of employment and reform of the social welfare system.  What legislation or measures will be put in place to ensure that employers adhere to the regulations currently in place for the protection of employees, specifically the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003?  Reported cases are showing that employers, specifically in a plant in Cork, are using this as a measure to renege on redundancy payments.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	74	No legislation is needed to require the enforcement of existing law in respect of employee protection.  That is a matter for the enforcement bodies.  I will check the position regarding the EU regulations to which Deputy Lynch referred and get back to him.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	75	It is not good enough for the Tánaiste to leave open the question of when the McCarthy report may be discussed in the Chamber.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, of a further contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established on 19th March, 1978 under UN Security Council Resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and in accordance with its additional enhanced mandate as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) of 11th August, 2006 as renewed under UN Security Council Resolutions 1773 (2007), 1832 (2008), 1884 (2009) and 1937 (2010) and subject to renewal of the UN authority for the mission thereafter.I am introducing this motion and providing information on the reason the Government is responding positively to the United Nations request to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.On 14 December 2010, the then Government authorised the Minister for Defence to arrange for, inter alia, the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for a period of one year for service for UNIFIL and to move the necessary enabling resolution in Dáil Éireann.On 22 March 2011, the Government noted my intention to implement the Government decision of 14 December 2010 and to move a resolution in Dáil Éireann approving the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL.  In commending the motion to the House, I will briefly outline the Defence Forces participation in UNIFIL to date and the background to Ireland's response to the United Nations request to provide a further contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL.Ireland has participated in UNIFIL in various guises since its establishment in 1978.  The main Defence Forces battalion was withdrawn in 2001 following 23 years of service with UNIFIL.  Ireland again deployed a contingent to Lebanon in 2006, for a period of 12 months, with a Finnish engineering company, when the UNIFIL force was significantly expanded under UN Security Council Resolution 1701 of 2006 made on 11 August 2006, following an escalation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon.  A small number of Irish personnel currently serve at UNIFIL headquarters in support of the mission.Lebanon continues to be viewed by the international community as a volatile environment requiring a robust and extensive international presence.  UNIFIL plays a vital role in stabilising southern Lebanon and in particular the area adjacent to Israel.  An effective UNIFIL presence helps to neutralise the potential for renewed conflict between Israel and either Lebanon or elements in Lebanon which would have potentially very negative and extensive onward impacts across the wider Middle East region.Since the unplanned withdrawal of the joint Irish-Finnish contingent from the UN mission in Chad last year, the Defence Forces and management in the Department have been examining all available options in terms of a deployment for the Defence Forces.  In November 2010, the UN requested Ireland and Finland to contribute a mechanised infantry battalion amounting to 500 personnel to UNIFIL.  The Finnish Government has also approved participation by the Finnish armed forces in this mission.  Planning for the mission is ongoing in consultation with the UN and Finland.It is intended that the Defence Forces would deploy an advance group to southern Lebanon on 23 May 2011, with the main contingent being deployed towards the end of June 2011.  The Finnish contingent would deploy towards the end of the year.  The advance group, comprising some 90 personnel, would include a command and support group, security party and an engineer platoon.  The authorised follow-on contingent will be up to approximately 440 personnel, but this number will reduce once the Finnish forces deploy.If participation in UNIFIL is approved by the House, initial deployment would be for one year, subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  In line with standing policy that the duration of any deployment should be set at the outset of a mission, I consider that any such deployment would be for a period of three to four years approximately and I propose that the UN be advised accordingly.The proposed Irish deployment in UNIFIL would be to a location close to the Israeli border.  The security situation in the proposed Irish battalion area of operations is currently calm.  The threat to Defence Forces personnel remains low.  The threat from armed elements operating in the proposed Irish battalion area of operations is assessed as medium.  Appropriate force protection assets will be deployed to this mission, which will be consistent with those of other troop contributors in the area.  The Defence Forces are satisfied they have sufficient capabilities, assets and experience to operate in the current and possible future UNIFIL environment in Lebanon.The cost of participation in the UNIFIL mission, along with our participation in other UN missions, has been considered in the context of the national recovery plan and the four-year projections for the Defence Vote 2011 to 2014.  I am satisfied that the cost of Defence Forces participation in the mission can be met from within the proposed allocations for the Department of Defence.As UNIFIL is a UN-led operation, the bulk of the troop, equipment and transportation costs incurred by Ireland will be reimbursed.  UNIFIL is a long established mission in the UN system and is well funded.  Given previous experience, it is estimated that the net additional costs to the Exchequer in 2011, taking account of UN reimbursements and planned cost reduction initiatives on other deployments, primarily the reduction in the contingent in Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 44 personnel to seven personnel, would amount to approximately €5 million.  On the same basis, it is estimated that the net additional cost to the Exchequer in 2012 would be of the order of €2.5 million to €3 million, offsetting the UN reimbursement and the full year savings from cost reductions in other operations.Deployments on peacekeeping operations play a major role in support of Ireland's reputation in international organisations, including the UN and the EU, and in its visibility and presence in international politics.  Ireland relies to a significant extent on the Defence Forces' contributions to support its role and credibility within the framework of international peace and security institutions and its role in international political affairs, given the very limited civilian and rule of law resources available to be deployed. In terms of international reputation, it is therefore important for Ireland to maintain a level of commitment to international peacekeeping operations and the obligations it has assumed through its membership of the UN.  Throughout the years, Ireland, like Finland, has taken seriously its obligation under the United Nations Charter to make available armed forces, provide assistance and facilities, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.  The proposed participation of both Ireland and Finland in UNIFIL is but another example that demonstrates our joint contribution to international peace and security.  Ireland previously partnered Finland in the UN-led MINURCAT mission in Chad.  The world of peacekeeping has changed dramatically over the past years.  Therefore, in the absence of partners, such as our Finnish colleagues, Ireland would be significantly inhibited in the range and nature of operations we could undertake in support of the United Nations.The Government is of the view that UNIFIL continues to play a critical role in helping to promote peace and stability in southern Lebanon.  A positive response to the UN request will reaffirm our support for the United Nations and be consistent with Ireland's commitment to UN peacekeeping.  Deployment at this time will be a manifestation of Ireland's long-standing support for the United Nations and its peacekeeping role.I am confident the Defence Forces will have a real and substantive role to play in helping to stabilise southern Lebanon and that they will continue to acquit themselves well and make a vital and important contribution to the success of the UNIFIL mission, as they have done throughout the world on so many occasions in the past.  I commend the motion to the House.

The country is proportionately a very significant contributor to peacekeeping within the international community.  I welcome today's statement as it gives us all an opportunity to pay tribute to the hard-working and courageous troops in the Defence Forces.  We do not say it often enough but we should all be very proud of these men and women who have served our country with great honour down through the years.  I wish to mention in particular the men and women in the Athlone Barracks and Mullingar Barracks.  Today's statements are also timely given that are we are approaching 29 May, the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.Since becoming a member of the United Nations in 1955, Ireland has supported effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	123	We have accorded central importance to the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland's obligation under the United Nations Charter to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security is reflected in our long and well-regarded history of participation in overseas missions mandated by the United Nations.The triple lock mechanism of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation, has allowed Ireland, a country which cherishes its tradition of military neutrality, to deploy troops to support peace operations in trouble spots.  I wish to reaffirm my party's commitment to the triple lock system.  The importance of our adherence to this system is two-fold.  It shows our commitment to military neutrality and the UN.  It also demonstrates that global security can only be achieved by the international community working together.Concerns were raised during the general election campaign as a result of Fine Gael's calls to alter the UN component of this triple lock system.  In its manifesto, it called for this obligation to be modified.  At the time, the Labour Party rightly said such a measure would "rip-up Ireland's longstanding commitment to military neutrality" and Fianna Fáil echoed these criticisms.  I was glad to hear this week that the two coalition parties have ironed out their differences and that the Minister for Defence has reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to the triple lock approach.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, pointed out this week that "the existence of such UN mandates confers legitimacy upon and acceptance of peace support operations by groups engaged in conflict".Over 50 years have passed since Ireland made its first contribution to peacekeeping.  In 1958, as part of an armed military observer mission known as the UN observer group in Lebanon, approximately 50 officers set out as observers along the armistice demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel.  More than half a century later, Ireland is again being asked to serve in the region.  This debate centres on a request to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL.  If the request is approved by the House — I sincerely hope it is — the total number of personnel deployed overseas will amount to approximately 570 when the contingent is fully deployed in late June.  We have been told that no special training programmes, other than the requisite pre-deployment training for contingents being deployed overseas, are envisaged.  If extra training is required, however, I expect it will be provided.Ireland has a long and proud tradition of service in Lebanon.  I welcome the opportunity for our Defence Forces to build on the substantial contribution they have made to the peace and security of the region.  I wish to pay tribute to the 47 Irish troops who lost their lives in the cause of peace in Lebanon since 1978.  Overseas service is an important feature of life in the Defence Forces.  It is the reason many men and women join the Defence Forces in the first place.  At any given time, there can be approximately 1,600 troops overseas.  Our commitments under the United Nations standby arrangement system, to which we signed up in 1998, mean that at all times we must be in a position to offer up to 850 Defence Forces personnel for UN peacekeeping operations, if called upon.  Regular periods of service overseas help to ensure our troops provide the best and most professional service.  This is the best way to keep troops alert and enthused.  As we speak some 130 Defence Forces personnel are contributing to 11 different missions throughout the world.In 1960, the Government, in response to a request for assistance from the UN, agreed to deploy Irish troops to the Congo to serve in their first major UN mission.  The mission marked a major chapter in our history as it was the first opportunity for the Defence Forces to serve alongside armies from other nations.  Over 6,000 Irishmen served in the Congo between 1960 and 1964.  The mission is remembered for tragic reasons as 26 Irish soldiers lost their lives in its service.  Ireland has made a major contribution to missions throughout the world over the years.  Conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Central America have meant there has been no shortage of demand for UN troops.  In the last decade, Irish troops have contributed to peace missions in Liberia, Lebanon, Chad, Kosovo and Bosnia.  At present, our main overseas missions are the EU-led Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo with 12 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the UN and the OSCE.  Other staff are deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, the OSCE and NATO.As I have said, one must feel proud of the thousands of members of the Defence Forces who have carried out their duties to the highest international standards over the years.  Our troops have gained extensive experience and have risen to the continuing challenges of peacekeeping.  They have shown a capacity to undertake increasingly complex and difficult missions.  The investment in and modernisation of equipment, training and infrastructure over the past ten years has allowed this to happen.  As a result, we are regularly approached to provide personnel to support peace operations such as that in Lebanon.  The nature of peacekeeping has change extensively over the years, from blue hat UN-led mission to regionally-led operations.  Our troops have changed with this by adapting to new circumstances.  The development of the EU Security and Defence Policy has placed a greater onus on member states, collectively and individually, to contribute personnel in support of UN-mandated crisis management operations.An important element of Ireland's approach to peacekeeping missions is the engagement of our troops at all levels of the community in the region where they serve.  Over the years, we have built a good reputation for our efforts in liaising with local populations and providing support and humanitarian assistance.  The fact that a number of Irish officers have held the most senior appointments in several UN missions is a testament to the fact that our Defence Forces are held in high regard.  Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty was appointed to command the multinational task force in Kosovo, while Lieutenant General Pat Nash was appointed as EU operation commander of the mission in Chad.  I support the proposal to send our troops to Lebanon to build on the contribution they have made there over the years.  I wish them the best of luck in their efforts.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978 as part of the UN mandate force UNIFIL, which was established under UN Security Council resolutions 425 and 426.  This State's contribution to UNIFIL consisted of 580 personnel who were rotated every six months, as well as 100 personnel in UNIFIL headquarters and the force mobile reserve.  Over 30,000 members of the Defence Forces served in Lebanon over 23 years.  The State's Defence Forces in Lebanon were initially intended to supervise the withdrawal of the Israeli Defence Forces from the area after the 1978 invasion and to prevent further fighting between PLO forces and Israel.  Another Israeli invasion in 1982 forced the PLO out of southern Lebanon and the Israelis then proceeded to occupy the area.The following 18 years, until 2000, saw prolonged guerilla warfare between Israeli forces, their allies in the South Lebanon Army and members of Hezbollah.  UNIFIL was often caught in the middle of the conflict, sometimes with fatal consequences.  In addition to their engagement in peacekeeping, members of the Defence Forces also provided humanitarian aid to the local population.  Most Defence Forces personnel were withdrawn from Lebanon in 2001, following Israel's evacuation of its occupying forces the previous year.  Hezbollah and the Lebanese Government argue that Israel has not completely withdrawn from all parts of Lebanon.  They continue to claim an area known as the Shebaa Farms, which the UN in 2007 decided was Lebanese.This motion has been introduced on foot of steps taken by the former Minister, Tony Killeen, after an additional enhanced mandate was provided for under Security Council resolutions 1884 and 1937.  As part of this enhanced mandate, Mr. Killeen sought permission of the Government for the deployment of 440 troops as part of UNIFIL.  The motion seeks the approval of the House to complete the triple lock mechanism of UN, Government and Dáil approval before members of the Defence Forces can be deployed overseas.  I am aware that since the unexpected and unplanned withdrawal of the UN mission in Chad earlier last year, Defence Forces and management personnel in the Department have been examining all available options for a future deployment of the Defence Forces.  The UNIFIL deployment will be undertaken in association with the Finnish armed forces, which served as part of the joint contingent during the UN mission in Chad.Sinn Féin will support the motion because it believes the task of international peacekeeping is a noble and worthy venture.  However, we should not underestimate the dangers posed to members of the Defence Forces while on peacekeeping duty.  Since 1958, the Defence Forces have provided in excess of 70,000 personnel for various tours of duty in more than 40 countries.  Some 85 of their members have died overseas and many more have been injured.  It is always important that overseas missions are fully scrutinised before the deployment of the Defence Forces and the triple lock mechanism is vital for this reason.  I, therefore, welcome the statement made by the Minister on Tuesday that he intends to retain it.The scrutiny of overseas missions is particularly important in the case of UNIFIL given the history of violence against UN personnel in the region.  As recently as 4 July 2010, members of the Israeli Defence Forces were responsible for the deaths of UN personnel when four people lost their lives in shelling, despite Israeli soldiers being repeatedly warned about the shelling by UN peacekeepers.  It is undeniable that Israeli forces pose a threat to international peacekeepers in the region where Israel is viewed by many as a rogue state, aggressor and occupier.  UN personnel have also been among its many victims in the West Bank and Gaza.I condemn the recent violence by extremists' in Gaza, specifically the killing of an Italian aid worker, which was an appalling act with no possible justification.  Our sympathies are with the family of the victim.The direct threat posed by Israel and armed forces within Lebanon to members serving with UNIFIL must be recognised and be to the forefront of any decision the Minister makes in regard to deploying further personnel to the region.  When Sinn Féin supported the deployment of peacekeepers in 2006, we stated it was regrettable that UNIFIL was only being deployed to the north of the Blue Line in southern Lebanon and not to the south of the Blue Line in Israel.  Our position has not changed; UNIFIL should be patrolling both sides of the border.  This is not the case, however, and the mission remains confined to south Lebanon alone.  Given that the Lebanese authorities are supportive of the UN mission, Sinn Féin also supports it.While this State has a proud record of involvement in peacekeeping missions overseas, including in Lebanon, we must remain vigilant in respect of attempts to co-opt the UNIFIL force into serving the ends of interested countries and their foreign policies and ensure such corruption of the mission is not permitted.  I call on the Minister to monitor closely the operations of the new UNIFIL force to ensure it operates at all times in a manner that is above reproach.  This is particularly important in light of the new, robust UNIFIL mandate.It is also important to stress that Israel has not fully withdrawn from southern Lebanon and continues to claim the Shebaa Farms area.  In his letter to the UN Security Council in August 2010, the UN Secretary General pointed out that Israel had still not met the requirement in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 to withdraw from the southern Lebanese town of Ghajar and the surrounding area, which is north of the Blue Line.  I ask the Minister to join me in urging Israel to complete its withdrawal from this area as quickly as possible.In the same letter to the Security Council the Secretary General referred to the repeated violation by Israeli aeroplanes of the Blue Line, which he described as continuing "unabated" despite being repeatedly raised with the Israeli authorities.  I hope the Minister will join me in condemning what the Lebanese Government has described as daily violations of its national sovereignty by Israeli forces.Despite the weaknesses in the resolution and mindful of the continuing support for the deployment of UN peacekeepers by the Lebanese Government, Sinn Féin welcomes the deployment of a further contingent of the Permanent Defence Force and hopes they return safely.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I wish to share time with Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Clare Daly.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the decision to send Irish troops to Lebanon.  Decisions of this importance should not be taken lightly because lives are at stake when we send troops overseas.  In principle, I favour the decision to deploy Defence Forces personnel to Lebanon because it is a United Nations mission.  Ireland must be seen to be involved in international peacekeeping.The triple lock mechanism is a key element of our foreign policy.  For this reason, statements made in the past that it will remain in place are welcome.Lebanon has a long history of conflict and bloodshed and thousands of innocent civilians have died in the country.  When we debate foreign policy and United Nations missions, we must bear in mind that lives are at stake.  Irish troops deployed to Lebanon should have a clear mandate to act at all times as peacekeepers, work with local communities and take a strong independent and humanitarian line.  Ireland's foreign policy has always reflected these priorities and I hope this remains the case.  I am concerned about some recent comments on our foreign policy.  We must not lose our independent approach to international issues and we must ensure we are not lumped in with countries which support the policies of NATO.In recent days, international pressure has been mounting on Israel to break the deadlock in the Middle East.  I strongly support the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and the proposed two state solution because co-existence is needed in the region.  The Palestinians appear to have given up hope of reaching a negotiated settlement and are pressing ahead with plans for the United Nations to recognise an independent Palestinian state by September, which is the deadline President Obama has apparently set for a peace deal to be reached.I understand Ireland, France and Sweden will become the first European states to recognise a Palestinian state in September.  I will support any such move.  I note two thirds of members of the United Nations will recognise a Palestinian state.  If the United States uses its veto on the Security Council, the Palestinians will take their case to the General Assembly.  The Palestinian issue must remain on the agenda in any debate on UN peacekeeping missions to the region.I offer my support and sympathy to the family of Vittorio Arrigoni, an Italian human rights activist who was recently murdered in Gaza.  Mr. Arrigoni, who was only 36 years old, arrived in Gaza in 2008 on board a humanitarian aid boat Israel had admitted to the coastal territory despite the blockade it has imposed.  I understand he was murdered by pro al-Qaeda forces.  We are on the side of humanitarian activists and peace, justice and truth.I strongly commend the troops who have served this country overseas and shown a great commitment to the United Nations.  I have the honour and privilege of having a nephew who served with the UN and my family is very proud of his role.  We must pay tribute to those who lost their lives for peace.  Their record in Lebanon, in particular, speaks for itself.  Over the years, I have spoken to many soldiers who served in Lebanon and it is clear that the local community trusted Irish Defence Forces personnel and worked closely with them because they did not have a hidden agenda or vested interests, unlike some other countries with imperialist histories whose forces served in Lebanon.  Irish troops built up good relationships with the local community in Lebanon in what was a classic example of community policing at its best.  Soldiers have told me they respected and protected people on the ground, while maintaining their independence and integrity.To return to the other issue, when dealing with the sending of troops to Lebanon, it is important we recognise the Palestinian issue must be dealt with once and for all, and there can be no more fudges and delays.  We have seen much hypocrisy from the international community in regard to the Libyan conflict, particularly in regard to the no-fly zone.  I often ask myself why there was no no-fly zone when Gaza was being attacked and Palestinians were being killed.  This hypocrisy must be exposed.  There will never be peace in the Middle East unless we deal with this issue, as all sides to the conflict realise.  If we do not bring in everybody, treat them with dignity and respect the integrity of their position, there will never be peace.  This is what the United Nations should always be about.To come back to the role of the Defence Forces, I stress the urgent need for Ministers to be vigilant in regard to our independent foreign policy line.  We must be careful in the Dáil.  Although some have praised the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for sticking with the triple lock, there are elements within the Government, within broader society and within the Army that want to take a very pro-NATO line.  It is up to us, as policy makers, to keep an eye on that.  I remind those people that Irish soldiers with the UN did not just get respect in Lebanon and the wider Middle East, they earned it.  They earned the respect of the people on the ground because of their impartiality and because of our history of not being associated with imperialism.  To have had 70,000 soldiers serve in 40 countries is a great record, which should be strongly commended.  We must remain vigilant and cautious with regard to the triple lock.I commend and thank the Irish soldiers and those directly involved in the United Nations missions over many years — the 70,000 soldiers who served abroad in those 40 countries.  I support the motion.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Irish troops have an honourable record in their deployment in Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.  For that reason, there is warm affection among the people of Lebanon, particularly southern Lebanon, for Irish troops and a recognition that their role, when they were deployed there between 1978 and 2001, was a genuinely benign one and a genuine peacekeeping mission.  I have no doubt, in so far as Irish troops may be deployed to Lebanon again, that they will continue to play that honourable role and will be warmly received by the majority of people in Lebanon.Of course, one must ask whether we should have to send troops to Lebanon.  It is a serious question given the fact 47 Irish troops died in Lebanon between 1978 and 2001.  There is potentially a real human cost for Irish citizens in this deployment.  While one can only praise the bravery of those troops who have been stationed there in the past, or those who might go there on this occasion, for putting themselves in this situation in the interests of peacekeeping, we would all agree this is a serious business and one we would prefer not to have to do.While the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, he also underlined the financial cost to the State of deploying troops, suggesting it would be approximately €2 million, or more.  At one level, this is money well spent if it in any way contributes to peace and peacekeeping in a conflict ridden zone.  On the other hand, however, it is of course money the people in this country would rather not have to spend, given the brutal cuts and austerity that are now being imposed on them, where every euro is precious for users of public services who are under severe pressure as a result of the economic crisis, the IMF deal and so on.  While we may have to do this, it is a pity we have to do it, and we should be aware there may be a human cost, as there was in the past.  There will certainly be a financial cost.Given that, we have a responsibility to ask why we have to send these troops and what we are going to do to address the underlying reasons that peacekeeping is necessary in that area.  I hope the Government will join me in acknowledging the reason we have to send troops to Lebanon is because of the continuous and relentless aggression by Israel in southern Lebanon against its people and the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.There is a constant, relentless history of invasion, incursion and brutal attacks by Israel against the people of Lebanon.  There was invasion in 1978 and again in 1982, when Israel colluded with the right wing, fascist Lebanese Phalange, which massacred hundreds of people in the Palestinian refugee camps at Shabra and Chatila.  In 1993, there was another heavy military attack by Israel into southern Lebanon and, in 1996, an Israeli bombing killed 100 Lebanese civilians in a United Nations military base at Qana, southern Lebanon.  The Israeli withdrawal took place in 2000 but was followed some years later by another brutal Israeli invasion which saw 1,000 Lebanese people, mostly civilians, killed, devastation of the infrastructure, bridges, villages and roads, and the use of cluster munitions and other vile weapons against the civilian population of southern Lebanon, causing great devastation and destruction.Will the Government agree that, in sending our troops into this danger zone, we must condemn that history of Israeli aggression and demand of Israel that it ceases such aggression in southern Lebanon and ends its occupation of the Shebaa Farms, mentioned by the previous speaker?  Will the Government also agree that the root of this conflict and the problems in southern Lebanon revolve around the issue of the Palestinian refugees?  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees have been living for decades in refugee camps in southern Lebanon, without a nation or rights of any description, because they were ethnically cleansed by Zionist terror gangs in 1948, who drove them from their homeland at gunpoint, using the most vile terrorist and ethnic cleansing tactics.Is it not a fact, and will the Minister agree, that until the Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere are given the right to return to their homeland, from which they were displaced by Israel terror gangs in 1948, there will be no peace in Lebanon and we will continue to be forced to send our troops into the danger zone to deal with the consequences of that fact?  Will the Minister state in the House that he agrees with United Nations Resolution 194, which insists that Palestinian refugees who were forced out in 1948 must be given the right to return and have equal citizenship rights in the land that was theirs and was stolen from them in 1948?A resolution demanding their right to return, which has been reaffirmed some 110 times by the United Nations since 1948, would be the simplest way to resolve this conflict.  We should ask the Israeli ambassador to Ireland why his country cannot grant that simple measure which would resolve all of this.  Let the refugees go home, give them equal rights, and let them live as equal citizens in the land in which their families and ancestors have lived for thousands of years.  We would ask no less anywhere else — that Arab, Jew, Christian, Muslim, persons of no religion and so on should have equal rights in that land.  That is what we should ask for in order to resolve this brutal and horrendous conflict which goes on and on, continuing to claim lives and to spur on violence and conflict.Will the Government call on the Israeli Government not to repeat its military aggression against the second international peace flotilla which will try to bring aid and support to refugees in Gaza later this year in an effort to break the inhuman and brutal siege of that region?  Will the Government come out clearly in asking Israel to allow the flotilla to bring aid to the beleaguered people of Gaza?  Given the gravity of a decision to send our troops into this situation, I hope we will take those types of actions and make those types of demands in order to deal with the underlying causes of the conflict in this area.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I come from an Army family.  Going back generations, members of my family have served in the Congo and in Lebanon.  I am well aware that the participation of Army personnel in Lebanon is done with the best of intentions.  The issue we should be discussing is why this situation has continued over decades and what it is achieving.  "Keeping the peace", as it is called, is really about maintaining the status quo and retaining a sectarian balance which is not in the interests of ordinary people in Lebanon where, like many other regions across north Africa and the Middle East, citizens are experiencing devastation of living standards and corruption by ruling elites.The Israeli Government continues to threaten and violate the airspace of Lebanon.  These issues will not be resolved by the UN or by the main powers within that body, which consistently act in the region to prop up the interests of Israel as their watchdog in the area.  However, there is a way out of this, with the solution lying with the Israeli people.  I welcome the growing numbers of Israelis who are refusing to serve in or be conscripted into the country's army.  Therein lies the solution.If we are seriously concerned about the situation in Lebanon, then we have a responsibility to examine it more closely and to seek to develop an alternative.  I welcome the development whereby people in Lebanon, in the course of the last month in particular and taking inspiration from the mass movements in north Africa, have become organised and begun to make a stand for themselves.  It is through this that we will see a real alternative.  In the past month there has been a growing mood of protest, beginning in a small way in Beirut where there was a demonstration by 2,000 people in very poor weather, growing the following week to 10,000 and subsequently to a demonstration in the city by 30,000 people.  It is a united movement against the political and institutionalised sectarian system that exists in Lebanon.We are beginning to see workers and young people in that country going into poor communities and taking the battle to the interior ministry, with slogans proclaiming a revolt against sectarianism, corruption, migration and unemployment.  The call of the people is for a toppling of the regime, similar to movements across the region.  There is a lesson for us in this because the regime in Lebanon, under successive Governments since 1992, has become a symbol of the slasher type of approach being executed in the national economy in a pledge to carry out the diktats of the IMF and the World Bank.  The cost of that is being borne by the ordinary population in Lebanon where there has been a cutting back in industrial and agricultural production, a strengthening of imports, an unemployment rate of 30% among young workers, inflation of 12%, a massive increase in electricity prices, high taxes on gasoline and so on.  These are the conditions which are breeding opposition.It is always ordinary people, no matter which side of the sectarian divide on which they are placed, who are the victims of these crises.  I support their demands for an end to the status quo.  The basis for that and the way in which it will be achieved is by uniting the workers and the poor of the region against the sectarian system.  It is in the interests of those at the top of society in that area to exploit religious affiliations in order to divide the people and bolster support for their own regimes, a situation we have seen not far from home.  They seek to foster a quota system which enables them to divide the spoils at the top while ordinary people at the bottom lose out.People in Lebanon need jobs and a living wage, and I fully support their activity to meet those ends.  Part of that struggle is a struggle against the status quo.  The experience has been that UNIFIL and so on have not delivered democratic rights and have not delivered power to the Lebanese people to take control of the resources in their own country and use them for the benefit of the population.  It is these people’s struggles, combined with the efforts of ordinary Israeli citizens who are making a stand against their Government, which will ultimately deliver a way forward for the region.  They will be far more successful than the methods employed for decades.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I thank the House for its recognition of the importance of the contribution of Ireland's Defence Forces to international peace and security.  I am grateful for the kind words, support and compliments from Deputies regarding the manner in which the Defence Forces have discharged themselves on overseas missions, in Lebanon and elsewhere.  I had the privilege of visiting southern Lebanon in 2001 during the course of one of our missions there and seeing what was then Camp Shamrock, as well as local towns.  It was clear in meeting with local mayors that the Defence Forces were held in very high esteem.  Their humanitarian involvement locally did a great deal of good in southern Lebanon and enhanced the international reputation of this country.This debate reflects the high regard in which the Defence Forces are held internationally as peacekeepers.  It also reflects the recognition Irish people have given to the importance of the role the forces have played abroad.  No decision to return to Lebanon could be taken lightly.  The previous Government made the decision and the new Government, having discussed the matter at Cabinet, reconfirmed that decision.  In considering any mission, our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount importance.  However, all missions involve some element of risk.  It is fitting to recall the 47 members of the Defence Forces who have lost their lives in Lebanon over the years, some in particularly tragic circumstances.  A full assessment of the UNIFIL operation has been engaged in, including a comprehensive and detailed reconnaissance by an experienced Defence Forces team, before the final decision was made.Members raised a number of issues.  Essentially, this is a peacekeeping mission to seek to ensure that conflict that has occurred in the past between Israel and Lebanon does not recur and the Defence Forces have played an extremely important role in that area.  No Member should simplify the nature of the difficulties that exist within that region or indeed within that area.  It is important to address and consider those difficulties in this State on the basis of the complex realities on the ground, instead of through some sort of ideological straitjacket.  Deputy Finian McGrath made reference to the importance of a two-state solution in a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The present Government and its predecessors have favoured fully a two-state solution and on a personal level, it is something I have advocated for many years.  The difficulty is to get to a point at which such a solution may be effected.  There is a range of difficulties and complexities in that regard, most of which were ignored in the speech delivered by Deputy Boyd Barrett, which perhaps may be addressed in this House on another day as it is not appropriate to deal with it in the context of this debate.  It of course would be everyone's wish that this region be settled, that the difficulties that exist be resolved and in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that ultimately a position is achieved in which there are two states living side by side in peace and harmony, each in security and focusing its efforts on economic development and co-operation to the benefit of the entire region.I was particularly taken by Deputy Clare Daly's detailed description of events in Lebanon.  The politics of Lebanon are particularly complex and to achieve stability, for decades the political system in Lebanon was designed around the sectarian realities of Lebanon as it then was.  The nature of Lebanese society has changed over the years and in recent weeks there have been some events in the Lebanon which are reflected in other parts of the Middle East.  Happily, however, the events in Lebanon have not produced violence in recent weeks and no deaths have occurred as result of them.  These are matters pertaining to the internal politics of Lebanon and are not matters in which our troops will be involved or engaged in any particular way.  The sending of troops, as part again of the UNIFIL mission, is not connected with those events in Lebanon but with trying to ensure that peace is maintained in southern Lebanon and in the context of the borders between Israel and Lebanon.  I believe and hope that our troops will be successful in this mission and have no doubt but that they will again re-establish relationships with the local community and will enhance the reputation they previously developed when there.I again thank Members for their contributions and for their support for the Defence Forces.  I know the Defence Forces will continue to acquit themselves well and will make a vital and important contribution to the success of the UNIFIL mission as they have done on so many occasions in the past.  A mixed mission between Irish and Finnish troops is a continuity with what has occurred on occasions and I greatly welcome the future involvement of Finnish troops, who I expect will join the Irish contingent towards the end of 2011 or by January 2012 as the very latest.  The requisite steps must be taken in Finland in the context of putting into place the appropriate arrangements in that regard.I will conclude by commending the individual members of the Permanent Defence Force, who have served and who continue to serve on overseas missions, together with their family and loved ones.  Ireland's substantial contribution to international peace support operations depends on the ongoing commitment of Defence Forces personnel to serve overseas in often difficult and dangerous circumstances.  Their commitment, service and loyalty to the traditions of the Defence Forces on overseas service contributes extensively to the high regard in which Ireland is held within the international community.  I believe the deployment that will now take place will add to that high regard and will continue to play in important role in attempting to ensure that peace is maintained in what is a very difficult and troubled region.

The Minister seeks recommital in respect of this amendment.  Would the Minister of State like to proceed?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I should start by noting my appreciation of the work that has been done by various Members of the Opposition in respect of this Bill, in which there is great interest.  I wish to have recommitted amendment No. 7 because as Members will be aware, it was not dealt with on Committee Stage and for something to be dealt with at a later Stage, it is normal practice to have it recommitted.  As I am sure the Chair will advise, this basically means the debate will revert to Committee Stage in respect of this amendment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Is that agreed?

It would be remiss of me not to again reflect on the absence of the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister is a little confused.  I have absolutely no objection to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, taking this Bill today as both she and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, are highly skilled elected representatives who are very informed on all that is taking place.  However, it strikes me — and I do not mean to be humorous — that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, may simply have misunderstood what the Nurses and Midwives Bill was all about.  Did he really feel that women in Labour had to take this legislation in its passage through this House?  While I am sure he will answer this some day, I have no doubt this is somewhat appropriate.I seek clarification on the seeking to recommit amendment No. 7.  My amendment No. 8 stands within the approved grouping and I presume that if amendment No. 7 is recommitted, Members will deal with that in committee and then it will re-present on Report Stage, where my amendment No. 8 can then be substantively addressed.  Alternatively, should I also seek the recommital of amendment No. 8 and the associated amendments the Minister has tabled that are entailed in this particular grouping?  I seek clarification of the House in this regard.  I am happy to accept the recommital and have clarified to my satisfaction that this is something that can be done.  I can put arguments for an improvement in the Minister's position in the course of that recommital and my amendment No. 8 would then stand when Members return to Report Stage.  I seek clarification that this is in order and that this is the shared understanding before Members proceed.  Does the Minister of State consider this to be in order?

I made several calls yesterday and this morning to have the clarity I required before proceeding.  That piece of information has not yet been proffered, so I welcome the Minister of State's comments.  I am happy to have amendment No. 8 recommitted also, since it is the kernel of what I seek to have addressed in terms of improvement of what the Minister of State is proposing in amendment No. 7.In acceding to that, I want to put the House on notice that a number of my amendments were disallowed on the basis that they might have involved a potential charge on the Exchequer, God help us all.  However, amendments Nos. 20 and 21 were ruled out of order because they did not arise out of committee proceedings.  I presume I must wait until we reach those amendments, but I would appreciate the same facilitation, in that, as I have established, I am entitled as an Opposition voice to seek their recommittal.  I would at least like to have the goodwill of the Minister of State and the Chair in respect of the recommittal of amendments Nos. 20 and 21 when we reach that stage in our deliberations.

If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle wishes to proceed with amendment No. 7, as recommitted, standing alone, I will put my arguments, but I will then seek to move, quite correctly on Report Stage, my amendment No. 8.  Amendment No. 7 will need to be tabled again on Report Stage.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be under no doubt about that.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	144	May I clarify?  Since amendment No. 8 is connected directly to amendment No. 7, if the latter is passed, the former falls because it is an alternative.  However, there is nothing to stop the Bill from being recommitted in respect of both.  It is at that point that we will make a decision as to which of the two the House will agree.  Is that clear?

I know this is technical, but it is important, given what is involved and how much depends on the Bill being improved.  If amendment No. 7 is recommitted, my sense is that it must return to Report Stage and be moved a second time following its discussion on Committee Stage.  Is that not the case?  I would then be happy to seek to have amendment No. 8 accepted in the context of amendment No. 7 being represented on Report Stage.  Surely Committee Stage does not supersede Report Stage.  That is not the train in respect of the passing of legislation.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	158	That is okay.  It is slightly confusing and very technical.Amendment No. 7 addresses the committee concerned with midwifery.  It clarifies that the committee cannot make binding decisions on the board, as the latter is overarching and has responsibility for nursing and midwifery.  A committee of the board — it is not a sub-committee — cannot make decisions by which the board will be bound.  There would be no point in having the board were that the case.  That clarification is what we hope to achieve with our amendment.  Under the amendment, the board must consider the advice provided to it by the committee in respect of all matters pertaining to midwifery practice.  The amendment deals with concerns that the board would not take the advice on board.  One could not have a committee making decisions that were binding on the board.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	159	We are on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State is wrong, namely, that the midwifery committee, which is to be established from Bord Altranais agus Cnáimhseachais, cannot have binding decision-making over all matters other than fitness to practice where its role and engagement with the board are concerned.There is a need to accept that, in the passage of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, there has already been a recognition of 12 specific health professions.  Why would midwifery be excluded?  I remember dealing with that legislation and I do not doubt that the Minister of State and the Minister probably reflected in the same way.  The Act covered such professions as occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dieticians etc.  We argued about why midwifery had not been included.  I remember that particularly.  I can see ongoing resistance to giving midwifery its due recognition and respect across all the disciplines in the health professions.  That is very unfortunate and the issue should be grappled with.  I would have argued for a separate board for midwifery if I did not believe the arguments for the establishment of a midwifery committee with similar powers were sustainable.  This is a joint board relating to nursing and midwifery, two very separate disciplines and professions.  It is very important that we do not perpetuate the failure to give midwifery its due respect and regard for those who practice the profession.The Minister can improve on amendment No. 7, which has now been recommitted.  I have presented real changes that will make a significant improvement to the Minister's text.  It is an attempt on the part of my colleagues and me to give real powers to this midwives' committee.  The powers in this legislation and with the Minister's amendment are inadequate for the profession into the future.  There are very serious concerns among mothers and maternity groups, as well as midwives and their associations, over the way in which midwifery is and has been dealt with in the presentation of this Bill.  Correctly, they feel that the role of midwives has not been given due recognition.The point has been well made in the oft-quoted fact — rather than view or opinion — that the terms under which midwives are legally required to work are also the conditions under which women are obliged to give birth.  If we return to the premise and accept it, there can be no doubt in our minds as to what we must do in this regard.The Community Midwives and others point out that if section 24(3) is passed as drafted, midwifery will be the only health care profession — of which I have named a number — without the ability to govern itself.  That is a major deficiency in the legislation which perpetuates the almost second-class view of those in midwifery.  It is one of the oldest professions and it is highly thought of and respected by the greatest number of our populace.The right of midwives must have equal respect to the other professions catered to under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  We must recognise that there are major crises in midwifery and the delivery of maternity care across the State.  Every effort should be made to strengthen legislation to arrive at the best possible outcomes.  There is currently a serious shortage of midwives running at approximately 30% in Dublin's maternity hospitals.  The hospitals are down in excess of 250 midwives in the service for the city and its wider hinterland.The KPMG report stated in 2008 that Dublin maternity services are at risk "of serious untoward incidents" as a result of the serious under-resourcing for midwifery in terms of staff employed across the three hospital sites.  These hospitals cater for approximately 40% of births across the State, which is a significant responsibility.  As a result of the shortage, midwives in Dublin are currently delivering nearly double the number of babies that they should be obliged to according to expert guidelines.  In other words, each midwife within the system in this city is working twice as hard as he or she should be.  That potentially impacts negatively on the quality of maternity care and makes medical intervention to accelerate births much more likely.  Statistics bear out increases in Caesarean sections and support that view.These front-line service providers do not want such a position to continue and midwives are the first voices and advocates for the best possible service to women before births, those in true childbirth and those needing post-natal services.  I record my support for the case they put.  We should make no mistake that women presenting today are less likely in overworked labour wards to be allowed to go through natural slow-birth procedures.  They will almost be fast-tracked in achieving, to use an industrial term, delivery systems.  That is unacceptable with all the consequences that can be involved.  Normal birth numbers are clearly declining and that does not meet women's choices at this time, which must be paramount in our consideration of the matter.The arguments for the improvement of the language are encompassed in amendment No. 8, which seeks to establish a midwifery committee "to advise the board, with binding effect other than in respect of fitness to practice matters, in relation to all matters pertaining to midwifery practice under this Act".  I commend that alternative to the Minister of State and believe it to be her natural inclination.  I urge her and her colleagues to assert their views on the matter and not allow a continuation of what is likely a male-dominated preparation of this legislation inherited from the previous Government.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin.  This legislation is very important and will define maternity services for the coming decades.  Midwives are not nurses but form part of a separate profession which is in crisis.  There is a  belief that midwives have been seriously undermined and they have advocated a view, which I support, that they need a powerful midwives' committee.  The Minister's amendment does not achieve this, and to say that midwives' opinions would be considered is meaningless.  There is no obligation to take heed of the opinions or pay any attention to considerations.  That is merely an obligation to listen to the midwives before proceeding.We need a binding role for a strong midwives' committee.  Many midwives are leaving the profession and it is in crisis, as Deputy Ó Caoláin noted.  There is a crisis in maternity hospitals because of a severe shortage of midwives in Dublin, who are delivering a far greater number of babies than at any time before.  This involves danger for staff, as well as for the women, their partners and their children.  We should take heed of international experience.  Modern midwifery legislation in New Zealand, Canada and so on is more reflective of the type of approach proposed in amendment No. 8 and goes against that encapsulated in No. 7.  We should ensure that people have access to safer, more accessible services — which, in this era of austerity and cutbacks, can be demonstrated to be much more cost-effective and safer for the women and for their children.Community midwifery services should be promoted.  It is worrying that smaller maternity units, particularly in rural areas, are closing, which will leave thousands of women without access to proper community-based midwifery services.  A key aspect in any effort to stop the rot and restore respect to one of the oldest female professions is to give this profession, as every other medical profession has, the right to govern itself.  This is important and will have implications for women over the coming decades.  Because of this, we should not just give a nod to the opinions of the people in this profession but should be bound by them.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	161	There is not a parent in the country who does not have enormous respect for midwives.  We need to make this clear, because they are part and parcel of one of the most intimate journeys a woman will ever take.  This is something we should all accept.Deputy Ó Caoláin has an interest and in-depth knowledge of the Bill, as I know from past experience.  In this Bill, for the first time ever, midwifery is now accepted as a separate profession.  We now have 100 direct-entry undergraduate midwifery places.  It is not just here in the House that this profession is seen as separate; people who wish to become involved in that area of health and social care also see it as a separate profession.We do not have a board that deals entirely with nursing or with any other health care profession.  What is being proposed in this Bill is a board that will deal with nursing and midwifery, which is an advance.  As a consequence, we will have a midwifery committee with a majority of midwives.  A board cannot have subcommittees whose decisions are binding on the board.  We all agree that cannot happen, and that is why I press the amendment.  I accept everything that has been said, and I respect the philosophy that informs that opinion, but we cannot have a subcommittee that can make decisions that are binding on the board.  We all know that would not work.  Perhaps in the future we will need to move beyond that, but it most definitely cannot work in this type of structure.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I remember when this Bill was first mooted.  My recall is that it did not include any reference to midwifery but dealt only with nursing.  The Nurses and Midwives Bill was a later development.  Going back to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, I always viewed — and still view — midwifery as a stand-alone profession deserving full recognition.  This Bill has been awaited for a long time, and I welcome the new Government's decision to fast-track it in the first weeks of the new Dáil.  We have all waited for the opportunity to get to this stage.  I always hoped the midwifery committee would substitute for the need to establish a separate board for midwives.  I have no doubt the Bill and the Minister's amendment fall far short of what is required.  If the Bill is passed in its current form, we will have ongoing problems.I have already made a point about the growing number of Caesarean sections in various hospitals.  The 2008 KPMG report mentions that 28% of all live births in the Rotunda Hospital in 2008 were by Caesarean section, and I am told that is just marginally above the State average.  We are talking about at least a quarter of all births across the State.  This is not what women would opt for first, and if the child had a voice, it might not be his or her choice either.  Such a level of intervention has implications for sustainability as well as patient safety.There is also the further consideration, in a time of serious economic constraint, that a Caesarean section costs three times more than a normal birth.  The Government is exercised about every possible saving, but by not conferring binding responsibility on the midwifery sub-committee it will allow the perpetuation of practices that are costing every contributing taxpayer more than they should.  Partly on cost grounds, the KPMG report also emphasised the need for significant enhancement of primary and community care.  Moving care out of hospital and into the community is key to the HSE's alleged transformation programme, although I have mixed experiences of that in my constituency and region.  Such changes, where they are happening, will require midwives to develop autonomous practices.  This is another reason for a midwifery committee that will act on behalf of midwives in a knowledgeable and decisive way, not only by giving recommendations and advice for others to decide on but by overruling, setting aside or introducing measures.If we consider international experience, we will see that modern midwifery legislation has empowered midwives in a variety of settings.  The examples I cite are Canada, New Zealand, France and the neighbouring island of Britain.  To amend subsection (3) as I propose would help to address the situation.  Again I urge the Minister of State not only to accept the arguments of binding effect but also to accept that amendment No. 7 seeks only to increase to eight the draft legislation's recommendation of at least five members.   I take some encouragement from the fact we are using terms like "at least".  In amendment No. 8 I ask for at least ten.  I sought to achieve that number in amendment No. 9 but it was knocked on the head because if another couple were put in, God forbid the expenses that might be involved.  The State surely could not carry this number and we are all far too busy bailing out the banks with billions of euro.  God forbid we should have another midwife coming along to decide how the profession's outlook for the future might be improved.I ask again that that element also be addressed but if it comes to a situation where the figure stands at eight, at least, I hope the Minister of State will use her influence to ensure the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly, is as generous and facilitative in ensuring the greatest possible representation.  That was the reason for many of my amendments.

If a recommendation were to come from the midwives' committee I do not believe the board proper would set it aside or ignore it.  It will probably be more for the future but we hope to appoint people to boards who at least have a knowledge of the area and would therefore recognise that when a recommendation comes it would be both sensible and appropriate.  I wish to reassure people on that score.

I then continued "including one who shall be a self-employed community midwife".  That latter point is lost on the basis of the numbers at the outset of my amendment.  I do not wish to press it, but I ask the Minister of State to take on board that section 24(3)(b)(i) at the top of page 30 states “2 midwives, including one who may be a self-employed community midwife;”.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect that the word “may” allows for it not to happen.  I ask that be changed to “shall be a self-employed community midwife;”.  I believe self-employed community midwives must be statutorily provided for in terms of access to the structures post this legislation.

In page 31, line 30, to delete "or the Fitness to Practise Committee" and substitute the following:", the Fitness to Practise Committee or the Midwives Committee".Both of these amendments were ruled out of order on the basis that they did not arise out of committee proceedings and I am now asking the support of the House and the Ceann Comhairle to briefly allow their recommittal so we can address them.  I assure the House that it will not take much time.Section 24(15) of the Bill states: "The acts of a committee (except the Preliminary Proceedings Committee or the Fitness to Practise Committee) shall be subject to confirmation by the Board unless the Board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation."  Section 24(17) states: "The Board may dissolve a committee other than the Preliminary Proceedings Committee or the Fitness to Practise Committee."  Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 can be judged separately; they are not grouped.  I seek to include the midwives committee in the wording in each section.  Subsection (15) would then state: "The acts of a committee (except the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, the Fitness to Practise Committee or the Midwives Committee) shall be subject to confirmation by the Board unless the Board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation."  Subsection (17) would further state: "The Board may dissolve a committee other than the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, the Fitness to Practise Committee or the Midwives Committee."It is important for the work of the midwives committee that it enjoys the assurance that its work and integrity are respected by the board at all times.  It should be the case that the board should not be able to dissolve the committee, just as the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee are enshrined.  That should also apply in subsection (15) to acts of the committee being subject to confirmation by the board.  That is surely not at variance with the Minister of State's already stated position in arguing for amendment No. 7.  I would like to see the midwives committee included there and in subsection (17) to protect the committee's position.  I urge the acceptance of amendments Nos. 20 and 21.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	194	We are back to the argument with regard to whether there should be a governing board.  If there is such a board, then it cannot be the case that a committee or sub-committee thereof be allowed to make binding decisions.  I fully accept that midwives will make the argument that theirs is a separate profession and for the first time ever this is recognised in the Bill.  They will also argue that they should have the right to govern their own profession.  However, that is not the structure with which we are dealing in the Bill before the House.  As already stated, we may perhaps move past the structure to which I refer in the future.  As of now, however, we are not in a position do so.  A governing board could not operate if one of its committees or sub-committees could make binding decisions which would tie that board into adopting positions with which it might not agree.In the context of being able to dissolve a committee, the Deputy and I are here long enough to recognise the fact that it is possible to have extraordinarily good boards and extraordinarily sloppy ones.  In the event that the board is not doing the job with which it is charged — and the Deputy and I may disagree on the nature of what will be expected of it — the Minister must have the power to dissolve it.  If we had that power in other areas, we might be able to move much more quickly to deal with particular matters.  What is outlined in the Bill provides a built-in safeguard that will protect everyone, including the board and the sub-committee in question.I cannot accept amendments Nos. 20 and 21 for very practical reasons.  At the heart of those reasons is the fact that we are obliged to deal with the legislation before us.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, in the future we may move past this provision.  We will not move past all of the Bill because the remainder of it is quite good.  Given the fact that we must deal with the Bill as it stands, I cannot accept the amendments.  However, I fully accept what the Deputy is saying.

There are two exceptions in this regard, namely the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee.  I am of the view that the midwifery committee should also be an exception in this regard.  I do not know whether she intended to frame matters as she did but the Minister of State is correct that it is possible to have bad boards.  I agree with her.  I am seeking to protect the midwifery committee because there could be bad boards.I do not want a situation to develop whereby the midwifery committee could be dissolved at the drop of a hat in circumstances where its continued existence might not suit the greater number of and wider interests involved with the board.  The representatives of the midwives will only have the certainty of their position, namely, through engaging at their committee with the representatives of nurses and other health professionals.  They must also have certainty with regard to what they can achieve there.  The board may certainly dissolve a committee but there are two exceptions in this regard, namely, the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee.  I am of the view that the midwifery committee should also be an exception.All of this is linked to our earlier debate on amendment No. 7 and is part of the out-working relating thereto.  The only solace I can take from what the Minister of State indicated — I do so sincerely — is that while this is the situation with which we are now dealing in the context of the passage of amendment No. 7, perhaps the political will, will be present in the future to address this matter in a more appropriate manner.

Under it, a sub-committee or any committee may perform any of the functions of a particular committee.  In other words, a sub-committee of the fitness to practise committee can perform the functions of that committee.  The amendment merely determines different functions.

On Committee Stage we dealt with the provision which prohibits an employee from being a member of a local authority.  There is a great deal of merit in allowing employees to be members of local authorities.  Given that public sector employees can make a valuable contribution to local government, I am proposing amendment No. 23, which will allow employees of the board to be members of local authorities.  I ask Deputies to support the amendment, which is reasonable.

Amendment No. 24 removes the reference to "post" in section 38, which relates to the fees the board may charge, and amendment No. 29 removes the reference to "post" in section 53, which relates to correction of the registers.  Again, these are technical amendments.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I move amendment No. 25:
In page 39, lines 24 and 25, to delete all words from and including "who" in line 24 down to and including "rules" in line 25.We had detailed exchanges yesterday and this morning, but I regard this as one of the most important amendments before the House.  Section 40 states that "no person shall, for reward, attend a woman in childbirth unless the person is (a) a registered midwife”.  I wish to delete the words after that.  They are, “who maintains adequate clinical indemnity insurance in accordance with the rules”.  Paragraph (b) refers to registered medical practitioners, but I do not note anything stating that a medical practitioner must maintain adequate clinical indemnity insurance in accordance with the rules.  This is a further indication of the almost two-tier attitude towards health professionals in some disciplines and midwives, most particularly, in the context of this Bill.  The amendment is an important one.  This section could severely curtail the ability of women to access midwife-led childbirth.I have consulted widely with a number of midwives and midwives' representative groups.  They have provided me with a range of important information.  I have no doubt midwives wish their opinions to be reflected strongly at this time.  We want to ensure that childbirth is safe and that all those providing care and assistance for women in childbirth are properly qualified, registered and accountable.  That is an absolute essential.  Let there be no doubt about that.We also accept that indemnity is necessary.  However, I argue that it should not be made a statutory requirement, as is provided for in the Bill.  The better alternative is to make indemnity a requirement in service-level agreements, such as the current memorandum of understanding governing services provided by self-employed midwives.Section 40(1), as drafted, paves the way for criminalising autonomous midwifery practice by setting terms of imprisonment.  It is horrific to look at what is prescribed here.  Terms of imprisonment of up to ten years are prescribed for midwives who assist in given birth situations and who break the extremely restrictive rules that underpin indemnity.  It has been noted that doctors, for whom insurance is not legally compellable — something the House may not know — face no such threatened penalties.  Nor is there any provision for other registered medical practitioners in the drafting of this legislation.  Making midwifery indemnity a statutory requirement does not serve the public interest.Section 40(1), as drafted, would enable the insurer, in this instance the State, to dictate the terms and conditions of childbirth for maternity service users.  In other words, this tells women the limited options they may have and the circumstances that must apply.  How far does the nanny state have to go?  This intrusiveness in the rights of women is quite ridiculous.  It is because of what has been described by the Community Midwives Association as "the minute and inflexible conditions attaching to this insurance".  It is unobtainable, for instance, if a mother turns 40.  We had echoes of that in the outrageous practices and the denial of compensation when horrendous acts were carried out against women by an obstetrician and gynaecologist in my region.  The former Minister for Health and Children, under advice from outside this institution, decided that women over 40 who suffered those outrageous acts were not entitled to compensation.  What is it about women at 40?  I am sure when I go home I will be put out of the house for saying what I am about to say.  My wife and I were very happy to be parents of a child after both our 40th birthdays, and it was not just the next year either.  I do not understand the notion that issues arise when women hit 40.  There are none.  It is a woman's right to decide and her health that will determine her decisions on any matter that may present.This measure is very poorly thought out, or else it is something else entirely and is quite purposely being pursued to effect certain control, not only of midwives but of women's choices as to how and in what circumstances they wish to give birth.  That is not on.Section 40(1), as drafted, restricts self-employed midwives from accepting various categories of mothers as clients.  It further obliges self-employed midwives to abandon their clients in mid-labour — think about it — should they exhibit some change in their condition that is prohibited by the terms and conditions of the midwife's indemnity.  A midwife could be attending a woman when a circumstance might present that, under the indemnity, excluded her from continuing to give hands-on care at the risk of ten years in prison.  This is bizarre.Making indemnity a statutory requirement threatens women's safety in childbirth.  Section 40(1), as drafted, leaves a mother whose midwife's insurance has just lapsed with two alternatives.  She may give birth at home without professional attendance or face unwanted medical treatment in hospital.  Women who do not fit the indemnity criteria are already opting to give birth at home without professional attendance.  That fact is easily established.Section 40(1), as drafted, prohibits attendance by uninsured midwives, even in cases of sudden or urgent necessity.  If a midwife whose indemnity had lapsed, in a social situation or going about her normal business, were to come upon a woman who found herself in sudden or urgent need, she would not be able to assist.  She would run the risk of a massive fine or a term of imprisonment.  The rest of us could rush to give assistance but the midwife, perhaps the only person in the company who had the necessary skills and knowledge, could not.  This is absolutely outrageous.At a time when many of the country's maternity units are threatened with closure, prohibiting emergency care by, for example, retired midwives does not make sense.  Reference to the 2010 Royal College of Physicians in Ireland/Health Service Executive report on acute medicine will confirm this.  Section 40(1), as drafted, significantly narrows the terms and conditions under which midwifery can be practised.  The existing memorandum of understanding is anti-competitive in that it significantly restricts the client base of self-employed midwives and this, in turn, significantly restricts women's access to the services of such midwives.  Self-employed midwives are and seek to be, insured.  We are not arguing here for anyone not to be indemnified.  The community midwives state and others in the sector agree, that safeguarding mothers against uninsured practitioners is easily achieved within a birth community that is relatively small and tightly knit.Section 40, as drafted, would effectively deny women choice in maternity care.  This is not in the public interest.  Hospital maternity services are at risk all over Ireland.  Plans are advanced to close many of the country's maternity units, as I know only too well in my county and community.  Community services must be developed to take the place of these services and the Bill as it stands restricts this possibility.Women not living in urban areas across rural Ireland have needs in childbirth that must be addressed.  Some face journeys of two hours in labour to access inpatient care, such journeys often ending with a medical induction or a so-called, elective Caesarian.  By effectively stifling midwives' right to offer services in the community, section 40 denies women the right to access community care from midwives.  Self-employed midwives have been unable to access insurance on the private market in recent years.  This is the situation today.  The only indemnity currently available to them comes from the State and this is based on what can only be described as narrow HSE home birth services.Section 40, as drafted, prevents midwives from providing all kinds of services in the community such as post-natal care and in Ireland the levels of post-natal care are among the lowest in Europe.  The section, unless amended, will deny large numbers of women the freedom to give birth at home.  It could lead to a rise in the number of unattended births.  Mothers who do not fit the State's terms and conditions are already opting to give birth at home unattended.  No mother should have to give birth at home without professional assistance.  Section 40, as drafted, locks in an insurance package based on a HSE contract that ensures that indemnity can lapse from moment to moment depending on the progress of a woman's labour.My amendment No. 25 is designed to reduce the risk posed by the current arrangements.  These HSE terms and conditions are operated in such a way as to prevent midwives from exercising their clinical judgment and even from exercising their duty of care to mothers and babies.  Self-employed midwives who feel ethically bound to continue to assist a home birth mother whose labour does not conform to insurance rules, for example, now face jail under this Bill.  This is a recipe for unsafe care.  Just in case the ten years' imprisonment did not shock Members, a significant fine can be applied to midwives who are outside of the terms of the HSE position.  I do not have the figure to hand but it is noted in my notes.Awards against midwives in the community are few and far between.  Over the past 30 years, payouts in respect of self-employed midwives have come to less than €250,000 in total.  This can be compared to other health professionals.  I cited one instance earlier in my contribution with regard to an alternative to the midwife, an obstetrician gynaecologist who cost the State millions of euro in compensation.  That was one consultant in a particular place and, sadly, there are many other examples.  By criminalising midwives who practice outside the State's onerous terms and conditions, section 40 denies women the right to opt for a physiological service, one that is low-tech and drug-free.  This is a right that has been recognised by the European Court of Human Rights.  Section 40 even prevents midwives from offering services such as breast-feeding advice in the community, cutting women off from their services.  The breast-feeding rates among community midwives' clients are among the highest in the European Union while national rates are among the lowest.While midwifery-based care leads to better health outcomes for mother and baby and greater client satisfaction, it also reduces costs.  Making midwives the main care-givers in the majority of births would save millions of euros.  Data from the Netherlands show that while one woman in every four had a home birth, home births made up only 5% of the total cost of care.  Here in Ireland a bed in one of the big teaching hospitals costs in the order of €1,000 a day.  Therefore, a 10% home birth rate would result in savings which are difficult to calculate but would be in the range of between €7 million and €14 million annually, depending on the numbers born.  This is without factoring in the cost of unnecessary Caesarean sections which I have already referred to in an earlier amendment.  The Bill, as drafted, cuts off this possibility and I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept the bona fides of the argument, the absolute need to regard the registered midwife as a responsible professional who seeks to ensure the best possible care and attention for her client, the woman in labour.  The addition of the statutory requirement for indemnity insurance is unnecessary.  That it is quite purposely singles out midwives and ignores all of the other so-called medical practitioners, is insulting to the midwife profession as a whole.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	There is not much scope for any new points after Deputy Ó Caoláin's contribution.  I support the amendment.  The key point is if the scenarios outlined by Deputy Ó Caoláin are true and I believe them to be true, then we have to take serious regard of this amendment.  It is a very practical amendment and it will not do anybody any harm. There could be no reason not to support it and the only outcome is a positive one for women and their children, for the midwives and for society as a whole.  Maternity services here are in crisis and nobody could argue otherwise.  This situation has an impact on the safety of women and children and an impact on the professions.  We have a responsibility to tease out the best solution to that problem in the interests of everybody.  Best international practice supports a very proactive approach to community-based care provided by midwives for all of the reasons suggested.  It is more cost-effective and is better all around.The points made by other speakers need to be re-emphasised.  The method of giving birth has been established as a choice for women, a right to choose the circumstances in which they give birth to their children.  In passing this legislation, considering all of the problems highlighted by Deputy Ó Caoláin, we are denying that right and undermining it.  We are conflicting with the rights already established by Europe.  The point has been well made that if this amendment is not passed, the Bill could succeed in criminalising people who are trying to do their job and who are trying to use their professional expertise.  This would be a crazy policy.  Mandatory insurance has to be dropped.  It belongs in service contracts and any concerns can be well addressed in that regard but to include it in this section is to discriminate against midwives.  It diminishes the profession and will have a seriously negative impact on the community, particularly in rural areas.  It is exceptionally serious.  I do not see any reason this amendment cannot be accepted.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Before I respond to the points that have been made, I wish to inform the House that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, intends to amend the Medical Practitioners Acts to ensure all medical practitioners will have indemnity insurance.  That is long overdue.  I take Deputy Ó Caoláin's point about general practitioners, gynaecologists and other health professionals not being required to have insurance.  The Minister's proposal will introduce such a requirement.I believe being pregnant and having a baby is not a medical condition.  I hope as many women of a particular age as possible can meet with the joyous experience of  this natural condition.  We need to make it clear that it is not something to be terrified of.  Although I do not believe our maternity services are in crisis, having had some interaction with them recently I accept they may be a little overstretched.  That can happen when there is an influx of people having babies at a particular time, for example.  It is dangerous to use the word "crisis", especially when one is talking about people who are vulnerable as they prepare to have babies.  I do not think we should encourage women to panic.  I believe in telling them the truth, but not in causing them to panic.Deputy Ó Caoláin and I have a great deal in common in our attitudes to this country's maternity services.  We need to ensure our community midwives are insured.  That is something we absolutely must have.  We have been very fortunate up to now, but all it takes is one incident for things to change.  When one considers the calibre of the people who are offering women the choices they want, one has to accept that luck plays no part in it.  I have always said that life is about choices.  It is equally important to have a number of choices and to be informed about those choices.  I do not think it is fair to midwives or those they serve to allow them to work without being insured.  Midwives are very well trained.  They are intuitive people.  Most women would tell one that they would prefer a midwife to a gynaecologist any day of the week.  The intuition and ease with which midwives approach childbirth is very important to women who are in labour.We need to get some things straight.  This indemnity does not prohibit midwives from providing post-natal or antenatal care.  It is clearly and strictly about the birth.  We all know things can happen before or after the birth.  The high point of this process is the birth itself.  That is what this piece of insurance is about and that is what we should concentrate on.  It is a question of patient safety.  We all know people who offer valid and worthwhile services to women who would prefer to have their babies at home.  We need to ensure such people are insured.  It is not a matter of prohibition — it is about insurance and ensuring the health and safety of the mother and the baby.  It is hugely important that community midwives who have signed service level agreements can connect into the local maternity service and have that as a back-up if something starts to go wrong.  These things can happen.  That support is important for the safety and security of the person being served by the midwife and it is equally important for the midwife.  I can only imagine the trauma experienced by the midwife and the mother who is delivering when something begins to go wrong.We need to ensure we cover all the bases.  We should move beyond particular interests.  I agree with virtually everything the midwives say.  One woman told me a gynaecologist told her she was early, but she replied by telling him he was late.  The presence of the midwife who has taken the woman through virtually the entire pregnancy is important.  This is about protecting both sides.  If there is disagreement about what constitutes an area of low risk, for example, we need to discuss such matters.  What determines low risk?  What additional resources can we invest to ensure women in the medium risk category can avail of the same choices as women in the low risk category?  We need to talk about such things.  We cannot move away from indemnity.  If something goes wrong and there is no insurance in place — we are fortunate that no such case has arisen to this point — those who are not insured will expect the State to pick up the tab.  I must admit that if something happens to a mother or a child in such circumstances, I would not have a difficulty with the State picking up the tab.  It is much better that we do this in an upfront manner.  It is a question of looking at best international practice and saying "this is the best way to do this".  If issues of risk need to be ironed out, we can do that as well.  I am sorry I cannot accept Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment.  We disagree on very little, but this is an area of disagreement.I would like to inform the Deputy that a national steering committee of home births has been established by the HSE to review the implications of the memorandum of understanding between the HSE and the self-employed community midwives regarding the provision of safe, evidence-based home birth services for low risk, healthy women.  As I have said, this may also have application to women who are deemed to have a risk in the medium range.  That is something we will have to examine.  A wide range of stakeholders, including officials from the Department of Health, are represented on the national steering committee.  The inclusive nature of the steering committee will facilitate discussion on the key areas of concern and will inform future guidelines and developments.  That is where we are eventually going.  If women who are deemed to have a higher risk than others wish to have their babies at home, it is a legitimate choice.  We need to provide for additional services and supports to make that happen.  Most definitely, we cannot allow people to operate in this area without having indemnity.

It does not seek to force anyone's hand by making mandatory insurance applicable across those disciplines where it does not currently apply.  It will be interesting to see whether the Minister, Deputy Reilly — I emphasise that he is a doctor — will be expeditious in bringing forward proposals to facilitate what the Minister of State has just advised us.  We will watch this space with considerable interest in the time ahead.The purpose of the proposed amendment to section 40 is to lift the statutory requirement.  No one present argues that midwives should view indemnity insurance as an option.  We are trying to cater to all circumstances which could arise and recognise the difficulties that currently apply.A new EU directive on mandatory insurance will come into force after Easter.  It will make unnecessary that for which the Minister of State argues.  The cross-border health care directive will oblige member states to ensure proper indemnity is in place.  In fairness to the European Union, of which I am not a fan, the directive recognises that fair and reasonable insurance must be in place before insurance can be made a legal requirement.  This is not currently the case in Ireland.I appeal again to the Minister of State on this issue.  It is not the case that we are allowing a deficiency to continue.  Things are being catered to but we should not single out midwives in terms of statutorily forcing on them a particular hand which does not apply to others.  I do not believe it is the Minister's intention to apply it to them in the time ahead.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I have no doubt that both sides are well intentioned and hold sincere and firm views.  The categories of women for whom community midwives will provide care can be addressed when we consider the criteria for a service level agreement.  This issue must be considered.  We cannot confine choices to women who are not at any risk.  Other women also want to have choices.Community midwives are different from other health professionals for many reasons, including, for instance, that they perform what in recent years has come to be viewed as a hospital based procedure.  Our attitude to this issue will change, depending on how we dispose of this legislation.  Frightening women into hospitals is a bad idea because child birth should be as natural as possible.  However, we must insist that people are insured in circumstances in which an expectant mother is isolated and something can go wrong.

I record my thanks to the various midwives and their representative groups who have spoken and corresponded with me in preparation for Report Stage of the Bill.  I hope I have done justice to the arguments of which they have advised me.  It is regrettable that we have not been able to reach agreement or have consensus and unanimity on the unacceptability of imposing a statutory requirement on midwives only.  To my knowledge, a comparable provision does not apply to any other health profession.  Enshrining such a requirement, as the Minister intends to do, does not have any purpose or point given that an alternative is provided, as we have clearly pointed out.The amendment proposes to remove mandatory insurance from the legislation because midwives do not have access to insurance as of right.  This point needs to be grasped and understood.I appeal to all opinion in the House to recognise that the imposition of a statutory requirement is tantamount to victimisation — that is not too strong a word — of a single profession within the wide health care professions.  I find that most objectionable and unacceptable.  It does not achieve by any measure the stated goals in terms of protection for women in labour.  The record shows unquestionably that midwives give exceptional care and are the first people women in labour trust and wish to be at their side in whatever setting presents.  I recommend the amendment and propose to press it.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Cuirim fíor fháilte roimh an Aire agus molaim é as an mBille atá molta aige inniu.  As the Minister observed, the criminal justice system is about more than just crime and punishment.  It cannot be focused solely on society exacting retribution from those who are found guilty by the courts.  Clearly we must hold those convicted of offences to account in a manner proportionate to the crime of which they have been found guilty and, in doing so, must ensure that, as a society, we recognise the impact each crime has on its victim.  However, our courts must also have the option of providing those who come before them of the opportunity for reform and, where the crime is of a minor nature, this should be done without necessarily imposing a term of imprisonment.At present, the options available to a court range from the use of the court poor box to community service orders and imprisonment.  I welcome the Bill that is before us today.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on his appointment and wish him well in his tenure.  He has commenced his work with great vigour and enthusiasm.  The Bill affords an opportunity to expand the use of community service orders.  These are provisions which not only deal with punishment, but enable those convicted to give something tangible back to society and allow society to see the positive impact a progressive criminal justice system can have.In 2010, the total number of community service orders issued by the courts was 1,949, representing a mere one third of the overall capacity available for the use of such orders.  The probation and welfare service's Value for Money and Policy Review Report, published in October 2009, shows that just 29 courts account for 80% of the total number of community service orders issued.  In other words, community services orders are being significantly underutilised.  There are several possible reasons for this.  It may be that legal practitioners are not petitioning the courts to grant these orders; it may be that the Judiciary has not been made aware of the spare capacity within the system; and it may be that many of those involved in the justice system do not see the positive impact these orders can have on the individuals involved and the wider benefit to society.This Bill proposes that the courts must consider imposing a community service order where it has deemed that the appropriate term of imprisonment is 12 months or less.  The obligatory nature of this provision will undoubtedly increase the usage of community service orders.  Statistics from the Courts Service show that in 2006 there were 4,607 committals on sentences of 12 months or less.  By 2009, this number had almost doubled to 9,216.  The increase in committals during that period was not matched by an increase in available prison capacity, further burdening a system that was already struggling to cope.  If we are to avoid a revolving door prison system, then short of increasing capacity, which has a long lead-in time, our only option is to provide for alternatives to imprisonment where deemed appropriate by the courts.Last Monday, I attended a meeting of the local policing forum in Cork city where we received a presentation from the Garda outlining figures for juvenile offences in Cork.  These show that it is predominantly young men, rather than young women, who offend, with the exception being in the case of shoplifting where 49% of offenders are male and 51% are female.  It is important that we examine the figures for juvenile crime throughout the State.  It is predominantly petty crime in which young men are engaged.  It is imperative that they are encouraged to become active citizens by participating in society and taking ownership of local projects.  The problem at present is that they are instead choosing to partake in activities that have a negative impact on themselves and on the communities in which they live.If these young men are sentenced to serve time in prison they will be exposed to further criminal activities and will be less likely to become active citizens who play a positive role within local communities.  As a former teacher and someone involved in sporting and community organisations I am aware of the onus on all of us to show example, to educate and to reform.  The Bill before us today will assist in this regard by encouraging young people, particularly young men, to play a positive role within local communities.  The enhanced provisions of the Bill will ensure the option is available to the courts to show these young men the positive impact of participating in community activity with benefits not only for society, but for those who choose to participate.  There are many people who would, if given the opportunity, participate in such schemes.The Bill is timely in that our society is at a crossroads.  It offers the courts the opportunity to increase the use of non-custodial sentences and to reduce the burden of over-crowding within our prison system.  If the community service order system were used to its full capacity, it could take 3,800 prisoners out of our prisons, immediately reducing the problem of overcrowding.  As the Minister outlined, the provisions are cost neutral.  Given the financial constraints under which this Government has been forced to operate, opportunities to make improvements from within our existing resources must be grasped and used to maximum effect.The benefits of community service orders for those on whom they are imposed are not simply the avoidance of a custodial sentence and the harsh realities of life in prison.  The orders can also provide convicted individuals with an involvement in civic and charitable projects, enabling them to take ownership of such activities and to contribute positively to society.  Nor are the benefits of these schemes confined to those carrying out community service; the wider community also derives tangible benefits.In Cork city and county, at any one time, there are between 320 and 350 people carrying out community service.  These people are working on projects that produce visible social benefits to the area.  For example, the graffiti removal project that was piloted in Dublin has been rolled out to Cork and is currently in operation in the designated RAPID areas of Togher and Mahon.  The projects, which are run in conjunction with the local RAPID co-ordinators, are successful and are making a strong statement with regard to the public realm in both communities.  In Mahon, the project is driven by the local community association under the stewardship of the manager there, Mr. Denis Coffey.  Within the community of Mahon, a great and commendable initiative to remove graffiti is being undertaken.  The success across the RAPID areas has meant the pilot scheme being operated in two areas will hopefully be extended across the city, which constitutes progress.At a time when there is a need for greater liaison between central and local government, both Cork City Council and Cork County Council are working closely with the probation and welfare service in Cork to ensure the successful completion of works that would not otherwise be funded or carried out.  To date, this has included projects such as litter removal, foreshore cleaning, cutting briars and general cleaning, which have had immense tangible benefits in local communities.  Moreover, people serving community service orders have assisted many of the local tidy town associations.  I met a couple of them last week before speaking on this debate and they speak highly of the community service orders.  Young people become involved with the tidy towns groups, assist in preparing streets and amenity areas for the competitions and take pride when given their own small areas and projects to look after.  In many areas of Cork city, the probation and welfare service is driving an allotments initiative, which again pertains to responsibility and creating a benefit to committees.  In addition, local schools in Cork have benefitted from community service orders through an initiative to paint schools in such areas.These benefits are not confined to State-funded bodies as charitable organisations also are benefiting from the wide use of community service orders in Cork.  A local chapter of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has obtained assistance from up to eight people carrying out community service projects, which enables it to carry out its clothes recycling project.  Again, this is of benefit to the charity involved and to those working within the system and the service.  A similar task is being undertaken by participants working in conjunction with the Greater Chernobyl Cause in Togher.  Moreover, in my local area of the south-west ward in Cork, elderly citizens have benefited from the provision of kindling made from broken-down pallets by the Togher Community Service Project that are supplied to them when they receive their meals on wheels.  These projects are being funded in conjunction with the probation and welfare service.  They involve young people who are paying their dues for their wrongdoing by being obliged to participate in activities that are of benefit to the community.The Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill will ensure the expanded use of community service orders, which provide much benefit to those participating in the schemes and to wider society.  It is important that Members embrace this Bill and understand it can and will have a positive impact that, as the Minister noted, can be achieved on a cost-neutral proposal.  It is to be welcomed and it is important that Members send out the right message, namely, the court system is about the victim and the community and about having greater common purpose.  When this Bill is enacted as legislation, it will be important that all parties involved within the criminal justice system will ensure that community service orders are used to their maximum effect and benefit.  It is important that this Bill be enacted and that there will be an opportunity for rehabilitation and punishment.While I hate using the word "punish", those who do wrong must be punished.  However, as a teacher and as someone who was involved with young people, I have in mind a number of past pupils who have been through the justice system and the important point is that this is about rehabilitation.  It is about allowing people to make amends for what they have done wrong and to repay society.  The Minister noted that offenders' responsibility will not be forgotten and they will be obliged to pay their dues but it is imperative that prison is not considered to be the only option.  It is important to have an alternative that has accountability and which places responsibility on the person who has done wrong and committed an offence.  Our communities deserve to be respected and people deserve to live in a society that has respect for law and order.  The Bill will change the landscape of how low-level crime is considered.  I commend the Bill to the House and commend the Minister on his initiative.

#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I assure the Ceann Comhairle that I will not avail of all 20 minutes.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate because from my perspective and that of many recently elected Members, a number of public order issues have arisen in our constituencies at a local level in housing estates and so on that have caused massive problems.  I refer to people being kept awake at night or having damage done to their property, as well as general causing of nuisance and so on.  In many cases, people feel powerless when seeking assistance from their public representatives or from the Garda.From my experience as a member of the joint policing committee in County Limerick in recent years and from speaking to practising solicitors in the District Court in County Limerick, I have noticed the volume of people who come repeatedly before the courts for what might be called petty or minor crimes and that the same people appear time and again.  However, it can be an extremely difficult experience for the victim who must endure what might be called a minor crime.  As recently as last week, I encountered a constituent who is a widow and who lives alone.  She is being kept awake constantly at night because of youngsters who know they are acting irresponsibly and know they are driving her mad.  Although they are aware they are behaving in a completely unacceptable fashion, they seem to get off on it.  Moreover, they know she will not go to the Garda because she is petrified.  Were she to complain to the Garda, she would be obliged to make a statement before anything could happen.  It is a vicious circle.The legislation introduced by the Minister is part of a series of measures that seek to tackle such crimes against people.  In a previous Dáil, an exponent of zero tolerance promised Members the sun, moon and stars in respect of what would happen in the criminal justice area but of course that did not happen.  There was much talk of zero tolerance, from which came discussion on anti-social behaviour.  From my perspective, the latter is a nice way of dressing up a crime against an individual.  It might involve depriving someone of their sleep and while some may not regard this to be important, such deprivation is a huge imposition on those who must get up for work at 6 a.m.The Bill being sponsored by the Minister will oblige judges to consider community service for those crimes that would incur a penalty of a prison sentence of one year or less.  This is a positive measure because if one examines the Irish penal system's recent past, one need only consider those who return to it on a repeat basis.  The figures for committals speak volumes when one notes the number of people who wind up in the prison system for crimes that will fall under the ambit of this Bill.  Although the Minister stated that this legislation would be cost-neutral, I believe that ultimately, it will lead to a considerable cost saving to the Exchequer.  One inevitable consequence is that there will be a freeing-up of prison spaces because of the numbers of people who no longer will serve prison sentences, which in turn will exert less pressure on the State to take up some of the options that were being pursued by the previous Government, namely, the creation of two super prisons.  I welcome an aspect to which my colleague, Deputy Buttimer, referred, namely, the willingness to consider what will be covered under the community service orders.  However, will the Minister take on board one matter of which I am conscious?  I hope the courts will be cognisant of the possibility of an interaction in the community between someone who is on community service and his or her victim.  We do not want a bad situation made worse by the victim or the person who reported the offence being intimidated.  There will be a degree of temptation.  Most of those on community service orders will be repeat offenders.  The statistics speak for themselves.Deputy Buttimer referred to rehabilitation, which is essential.  People must feel that they are giving something back to society.  Speaking as a teacher, the sad reality for many children is that they get into a rut and wind up before a District Court when they are older.  Some of them are on a path to crime from the age of six or seven years.  During the coming years, the Government will face the challenge of breaking that cycle via the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Skills, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality.The Government advocates support for the Garda and its fantastic members.  People who are pursued through the courts cannot be put anywhere currently, which means they are out on the street and causing further problems.  This Bill will give offenders an opportunity to repay their debts to society in public, so people will see that doing the crime means doing the time.Deputy Buttimer was correct about the initiatives in his area.  I can see some of the benefits that would accrue in my area, particularly given the difficulty in accessing funding for local authority work on parks, amenities and so on.  As regards other countries, the research from New Zealand speaks for itself, in that community service orders have proven successful.The initial statement in the Bill is that the orders do not constitute a major change, but that is wrong.  To the many people who contact me, other Deputies and local councillors, this provision will make a difference.  Where they have been victimised, they will see penalties being served by the people who perpetrated acts against their communities.  This must be welcome.As I have not had an opportunity to do so yet, I wish the Minister well in the coming years.  This is a significant challenge.  As for all line Ministers, financing will be a difficult issue for him.  This Bill is cost neutral and the initiatives it contains will help.  Given the good will built up by the Government by taking measures like this, there is an opportunity to make a real difference in the area of criminal justice.  I commend the Bill to the House.

It was a popular one.  People ran up and down the corridor to the governor every five minutes looking for TR.To get an education on how the prison system works, one can do a degree in criminology or so on.  Another good way to see how it works — or, rather, does not work — is to be with those people in the pit, as it were, and to listen to why they are there.  Once one discovers the why, one can start to work out how to ensure they do not return.  For this reason, I commend the Bill's initiative.  It is a fantastic idea.  I am somewhat baffled that it is revenue neutral, as I cannot see how it is not revenue positive.  According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT — my thanks to the wonderful Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which I discovered in the past week — this initiative could reduce the cost from €77,222 to €2,500.  While the physical building will still be provided and there will be many other costs, it is also clear that a great deal of money will be saved.Public support is necessary.  Much of the reason for going down the road of jailing anyone who picks his or her nose, so to speak, is that the media has driven us in that direction.  The media seems to forget that, in the United States of America where one can get jailed for not covering one's nose when sneezing, the more people who are put in prison, the more problems the US seems to have.  As such, it is great that we are going down this road instead.I would make certain exceptions to the Bill, for example, white collar crime.  A young hardy lad who is sent into prison will need to deal with it all.  He might just be able to manage it.  However, some white collar criminals might be more deterred by prison.  In such cases, prison sentences might not be a bad idea.  I am curious about the limit of 240 hours.  I do not see why the time could not be extended.This initiative would affect approximately 14% of prisoners.  In light of the IPRT's figures, this would accrue significant savings.  If we are to bring the public on board, these savings should be reinvested in the community.  For example, there is a prison in my town.  To get support, one could say how, if ten people were given community service, the State would be saved approximately €500,000, which could be spent on putting a roof on the swimming pool in Castlerea.  Those ten people could even help with the construction.  They would be taught new skills, a new service would be brought to my area, the money that would have been spent would instead be saved and the new facility would create employment and render it more likely that young people would get involved in sport, become more active physically and mentally and, as a result, be less likely to end up in prison.  If one can show the public it will be a win-win situation, it will receive support and quieten those among the media who want to flog and hang them all, an approach that does not work.I spent a short time in Castlerea Prison, but I was also moved to Loughan House where I met many young people who, at great cost to the State, were sitting around and discussing with people who they had never met previously what they were going to do when they got out.  Invariably, they discussed how to get together and do a better job of robbing some place.  Under the community service system, though, they could actually learn something.  Research shows that community service does not pull people out of the education system, keeps them in close proximity to their families and so on and is of considerable benefit to their communities.Since entering Dáil Éireann a couple of months ago, I have heard much that would not send one out of here in great humour or leaping and bounding with hope for life, but great hope could come from this initiative were it carried out in the right way.  I understand that we only utilise one third of the capacity of the Probation Service.  If so, the initiative is even more revenue positive, given our existing capacity to deal with many of the cases in question.The initiative is positive, although I will make a suggestion.  I am not a hard man and do not proclaim to be one.  The most terrifying experience I have had was being brought to prison for the first time.  I admit I was terrified.  By the second day I was not quite so terrified and after the third day I was anything but terrified as I had acclimatised.  I have a suggestion, although it may not fit within the remit of this debate.  People can be given community service but they can also be given the experience of one night in prison.  On foot of one night in prison an alternative can be explained as the learning of a skill or helping the community.  Potentially, somebody could turn turf for the person he or she robbed a couple of months earlier, providing benefit to the victim.  People can make a choice, whereas if they go straight to community service without knowing the terrifying prospect ahead of them if they do not toe the line, the effect will not be as powerful.  If people are put in jail for a night, they can be shown what it is like.  From my experience, I know it to be scary, so people would be far less likely to want to go to prison.I went to prison twice for non-payment of fines.  When I went the second time it was like water off a duck's back and I was not scared.  I was never going to be forced to pay a fine anyway as it was a matter of protest.  If somebody commits a crime, such a procedure would make that person think twice.  I was put in a remand cell on my own and experienced the torture of being able to listen to only one radio station, Midwest Radio, which was playing country and western music.  How that did not put me off it for life I do not know.  It makes one think.  I was correct in what I did but I asked myself why I was there and why I had done what I did.  It gives people the chance to think.  After a day a person can go out to help Mary, who that person might have robbed.  That person could turn her turf.  Such action might illustrate which way is good and which is bad.  This Bill brings good news and I hope it will be implemented well.

It is fitting that Deputy Broughan is in the Chair as I thank the electorate of Dublin North-East for electing me again to the Dáil after a 14-year absence.  Unlike Deputy Flanagan, I did not have to complete a community service order, although losing a seat is somewhat like it.  I pay tribute to those who lost seats in the last general election, of which there were many.  I am sure they are going through a difficult time and I empathise with them, having gone through the process myself.  I assure them that it is possible to be returned to the House.I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the section requiring that if an offender has been convicted and the court is of the opinion that a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months would be appropriate, the court will consider as an alternative to that sentence the imposition of a community service order.  This is a progressive improvement on existing legislation.I understand a review of community service orders on a value-for-money basis was conducted in 2009, with the review indicating that the scheme was not being used to its full extent.  There was potential for significant financial savings by imposing community service orders as an alternative to custody in sentencing for minor offences where a sentence of up to 12 months may be appropriate.  The imposition of community service orders would also have a positive impact on an offender and the community benefiting from work carried out.The Irish Penal Reform Trust has welcomed the introduction of the Bill, and it has indicated the proposed Bill can make a real difference to a number of problems within the justice system.  It points out that the Irish prison population has doubled since 1997, with sentence committals rising by 35% in 2009, which is the last year for which it has figures.  The figures rose from 8,000 in 2008 to nearly 11,000 in 2009.  The trust also points out that 70% of sentenced committals in 2009 were for six months or less.  They also point that over 3,600 committals were for road traffic offences in 2009, representing a third of the total.  That was an increase of almost 60% from 2008.  The trust also argued that community sanctions are much cheaper than imprisonment and, with certain categories of offenders, are demonstrably more effective with lower levels of reoffending.  That is of crucial importance in consideration of the Bill.In 1991, I was Lord Mayor of Dublin and I was granted permission at the time by the Minister responsible for justice to visit Mountjoy Prison following a number of deaths by suicide in the prison.  Deputy Flanagan spoke about his experience in Castlerea so I will talk about my experience in visiting Mountjoy, although I visited the facility under different circumstances.  I met the prison governor, Mr. John Lonergan, and his prison staff, who allowed me to visit all the areas of the prison I wished to see.  At that time I was appalled by the conditions I saw there and, regrettably, little has changed in the intervening period except that overcrowding in the prison has increased.  The building of a replacement prison in Mountjoy is still awaited despite all the concerns expressed.I met prisoners at the time who were there for not having car tax or motor insurance.  I found, through discussions with the prisoners, that literacy problems seemed to play a large part in their issues with tax and insurance, etc.  I also met a number of Travellers who were imprisoned at the time.  Such people would have been better served by being placed on community service orders rather than being incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison.  I take this opportunity to commend to the House the record of John Lonergan as a humane and fair governor of Mountjoy Prison.

#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I was a member of Dublin City Council up to six weeks ago so I will discuss the use of community service orders by local authorities and my city council in particular.  I was a member of the joint policing committee of Dublin City Council and I am aware that sanctions are needed to deal with cases where people are involved in anti-social activity or crime.  There is no getting away from that.A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, introduced a scheme to remove graffiti in Dublin through his Department, although unfortunately it was withdrawn in 2009 because of cuts.  In 2008 alone in the council's north-central area — which I represented at the time — €250,000 was spent on removing graffiti.  The withdrawal of the scheme in 2009 left a gap in the services provided to remove graffiti and the implementation of such a scheme through community service orders would be welcome.  Currently, preparations are being made for the visit of the Queen of England to Dublin.  Unfortunately, there is recent evidence of the daubing of graffiti in public areas by people opposing the visit.  Extra resources must be put in place to stop this kind of activity.Dublin City Council's public domain officers have told me there is a list of community projects which could be implemented through an expansion of the community service order scheme for the benefit of the community and the voluntary sector.  There is plenty of capacity to utilise the scheme more efficiently in order to complete work in the voluntary community sector.I can provide one or two examples of the kind of work has been done.  The Stardust park in Coolock has been repainted recently.  The railings in St. Anne's Park have been repainted.  The local communities in these areas are appreciative of such work and of the effort that participants in the schemes have put in.  They think it is a positive thing.  There is also anecdotal evidence that dialogue sometimes takes place between the participants in the scheme and the youths who created the graffiti or litter in the first place, which can have the positive effect of ending the anti-social activity.I am aware there have been some objections to works carried out under the scheme, mainly from painting contractors and so on.  However, we must bear in mind that the type of work carried out under the scheme is in the community and voluntary sector; it is work that would not otherwise be done.  I do not think it can be argued that it is doing anyone out of a job.  It must also be said that local authorities often provide many of the materials used in the schemes, so there is little cost to the community and voluntary sector, which is the main beneficiary of this work.  I welcome the Bill.

Measaim gur Bille maith é, ach is trua gur thóg sé an fhad seo orainn an staid seo a shroicheadh.  Ní chóir go mbeadh orainn reachtaíocht ar leith a chur i bhfeidhm chun go mbreathnódh breithiúna ár gcúirteanna ar obair dheonach mar bhreith.  Ba chóir go ndíreoidís ar sin gach lá, go háirithe mar go bhfeiceann siad cad a tharlaíonn do dhaoine óga a chuirtear i bpríosún.  Go minic nuair a chuirtear duine i bpríosún, tagann athrú iomlán ar a saol ach ní ar son a leasa ach a mhalairt.  Bheadh breith mar seo oiriúnach go háirithe do dhaoine nach raibh baint acu leis an gcóras dlí agus cirt roimhe seo agus nach bhfuil ach botún nó dhó déanta acu.  Nuair a chuirtear pionós príosúin ar dhaoine mar seo, nuair a thagann siad amach as an bpríosún bíonn siad gafa nó ceangailte le grúpaí de bharúin drugaí nó a leithéid.Aontaím gur cóir i gcónaí féachaint an bhfuil a mhalairt de phionós nó de threo ar fáil do dhaoine nach bhfuil ach ciontaithe do choireanna bheaga nó a chiontaíodh toisc nár íoc siad fíneáil nó a chiontaíodh ar chúis road traffic offences.  Ní chóir go mbeadh gá dúinn an Bille seo a chur i bhfeidhm, ach is léir gur gá é a dhéanamh toisc nach raibh na breithiúna sásta é a dhéanamh gach uair a tháinig daoine os a gcomhair.  Mar sin, táim sásta tacú leis an mBille seo.I agree with this Bill wholeheartedly, although it should not have been necessary, as judges should have been trying to apply community sanctions as much as possible anyway.  In many cases, judges did consider this, but because of under-investment in the Probation Service the opportunities were not always available to divert people from spending a couple of months or years in prison.  Judges had to impose prison sentences because the supports were not there to allow for greater use of community service options.  That is one of the key responsibilities of the Minister.  If we are to impress upon judges that they must consider to a greater extent the use of community sanctions, we must ensure the Probation Service is properly resourced.  One mechanism for doing this would be to divert some of the money that is currently used to incarcerate people towards the community service option.  It would pay dividends in the long term.  I am not saying prison budgets should be cut, but if there are fewer prisoners it will allow for budgets to be cut.  We could divert to the Probation Service some of the money that was ring-fenced by previous Governments to invest in a super-prison at Thornton Hall.  We are not talking about a large amount of money compared to the cost of incarcerating prisoners.  It is relatively cheap.Another important point about community service orders is that justice can be seen by the public to be done.  Time and again one hears constituents at community groups or policing forums ask why so-and-so is back on the street after being sentenced a few weeks or months ago.  With community sanctions as part or all of a sentence, the offender will be seen to be doing work that is of benefit to the community.  In some cases, it is to be hoped, community service will change the attitudes of people who have been guilty of criminal damage, robbery or road traffic offences, and they will have a greater degree of respect for their surroundings, their neighbours and businesses in their communities.  It might have a better effect than locking them up and throwing away the key.  Because prisons are so overcrowded, the services that are required to rehabilitate prisoners are not able to cope with demand, which means that many of those in prison do not benefit from increased literacy, knowledge of a trade, or the ability to work as part of a team and communicate with people on a personal basis.  However, offenders will gain some of these benefits through the community service option, because they will be forced to work as part of a team and in public.I was asked a number of years ago to become a director of the Liberties recycling training and development project, which has a drugs rehabilitation programme in which 50 recovering addicts work in clothes recycling.  The board was informed recently that the project had contacted the Probation Service offering to allow a number of people to work at the project for the period specified by the judge.  Other companies and projects will do the same including, as Deputies mentioned, Dublin City Council and community groups.  There will be a benefit from the use of community service orders to pick up the slack from the lack of investment in city and county council areas where money is not currently available to clean up public spaces.  If we are trying to attract tourists into the country, would it not be useful to have a squad of people, under the direction of the Probation Service, carrying out works that cannot currently be carried out because of a lack of funds, including the painting of railings, school buildings and community halls?  None of these tasks requires a large amount of skill.  Some of the people who will come under these orders may have considerable skills.  Some might be diverted to the community service option because they were involved in road traffic offences and should not have been in prison in the first place.  This is especially the case for non-violent offenders.  In most cases there must be a way of addressing those types of crimes other than by incarcerating people.  We will see a benefit from that.  There is a range of options.Since this is a probation and welfare service, we must ensure that the welfare of offenders is taken into account and that judges will divert offenders to the care of the probation and welfare service not only to be used as cheap labour or to carry out work that otherwise would not be done.  The service must have a role in identifying the problems some of these people will have and the roles that exist for them, so that they can be pointed in the right direction.  In that way, if the problem is addiction, the person will be brought to the attention of the local addiction services.  If a person presents with a literacy problem and has removed himself or herself from the normal day to day community because of that it and the consequent lack of self-esteem, that also can be addressed.  Supports need to be available to help those people.  In the vast majority of cases the people we are discussing are unemployed and many believe themselves to be unemployable.  Such issues can be addressed.  The probation and welfare service officers will have an opportunity to spot something which might not be spotted in prison and can try to help people to rebuild their lives away from whatever crime was committed.  There is an opportunity.There were two restorative justice projects in this State — one in Tallaght, the other in Nenagh.  Both made presentations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Law Reform five or six years ago.  The people involved were very enthusiastic about the projects.  The principal person behind the restorative justice programme in Nenagh was the local judge who identified the very concerns I mentioned.  Rather than putting a person in prison where problems would be exacerbated, he identified likely persons and put them on a restorative justice programme that dealt with the victims of crimes such as burglaries, thus engaging them with those they had offended.  He used that method in a similar way to what is suggested in this Bill.  We should look again at having more such projects.  In terms of cost effectiveness, in common with most restorative justice programmes, they proved very successful in every jurisdiction in which they have been developed when compared to other costs such as those involved in sending a person to prison and the effect that has on the person, his or her family and on society.  I urge that when a justice committee is established in the Oireachtas we look again at restorative justice.  It is not something that must necessarily fit into this Bill; I want this Bill to be passed as quickly as possible.One of the few positive measures the last Government took in the past six to eight months was to increase from a very low point the number of probation and welfare officers.  That was welcome but if there is to be an increase in programmes such as community service we must ensure there are enough probation and welfare officers.  If that means diverting people from other parts of the justice system that must be done.  I hope judges will listen to what is being said in the House concerning this Bill and that they will start diverting people towards community service and, as a society, we will see the benefit of that in the near future.  It will not happen overnight but will eventually happen.The big problem in our jails is the significant levels of overcrowding.  The answer of the previous two Governments was to build more prisons.  They closed some of the better, smaller prisons which were more inclined to help offenders address some of their problems and moved towards a super prison regime.  This has not worked in other jurisdictions.  The level of overcrowding is scary, as is the increase in numbers of people convicted and sentenced to prison for short sentences for minor crimes.  We must re-examine this issue rather than having an increase of more than 50% in the numbers of people sentenced to from six to 12 months as we have seen in recent times.  That is part of what this Bill is about.  We must look at the whole area of non-violent offence.  There was an increase of 40% in the numbers sentenced to less than 12 months for non-violent offences and a 17% increase in sentences for road traffic offences.  That is a range of people who probably should not be in jail.  However, there are people who need to be in jail, those who are a danger to society and those who need to be punished.I am not 100% sure if the following measure could be achieved in this Bill or at all at this time.  At present if a judge suspends part of a sentence in a high profile case there is resultant furore.  In the main, there is logic behind suspending a sentence.  Judges should consider whether, after sentencing people to a certain period in prison, then, as part of the sentence, they could sentence them to subsequent community service rather suspending the sentence.  Again, there is a double effect.  If the crime is so bad that the person must be punished by being imprisoned, afterwards society and the community from which the person came could see justice being done upon the prisoner's release.  This might be a better mechanism to use in such cases.Violent crimes in the community seem to be on the rise and young criminals are intimidating older residents.  They travel in gangs.  When we were young we travelled in groups or little gangs but we had respect for our community.  We did not carry knives, which seems to be a significant trend among young people nowadays and accounts for the rise in the number of stabbings.  There was not the access to the type of weaponry young people regrettably seem to have now.  That must be examined.Rather than locking up people involved in criminal damage and blatant vandalism, the vandals should have to make good the criminal damage done by them and perhaps by others.  It is a welcome part of the legislation that people would be seen to help to make amends publicly for criminal damage, intimidation and robberies, of which there has been a spate in recent years, most likely linked to unemployment.  There has been an increase in the number of robberies, in particular of older people.I reiterate my support for the Bill.  There are major issues involved.  When the Government introduces cuts to drug projects, community groups and so on in society it must be mindful of the need to address the many underlying problems.John Lonergan, the former governor of Mountjoy Prison was mentioned earlier.  He was a shining light for many years on how society should address offenders.  One key point he often made was that many of those who were in Mountjoy Prison came from specific districts of Dublin.  He maintained the problem was that those areas had underlying problems including drug abuse, deprivation, unemployment and low educational standards, problems that remain to be addressed.  The more we address these issues, the less chance there is people will come before the courts and fewer people will end up in our jails.  I urge the Government to keep this in mind in the current economic crisis.  If we do not address these problems we will end up with the same cohort of people from the same areas making up the majority of prisoners.A vast range of areas should be considered including graffiti removal and chewing gum removal.  These are not high skill jobs.  A look at any of our footpaths throughout the country would indicate these are tasks that should be carried out.  A great number of derelict sites are under the control of NAMA.  These could be cleaned and tidied up and changed into allotments or public spaces until such time as the economy bounces back.  The parks department of the county council and the OPW could be involved.  Canal walks, community halls and all the public demesne could benefit from a clean up.  Another possibility is the replanting of forests.  The Probation Service should examine ways to progressively and positively use some of the skills of the people who come before it.  Hopefully, in the future they can be put to use.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I begin by thanking everyone who has participated in the debate.  In particular, I thank Deputies for the support they have expressed for the Bill.  Also, I congratulate the speakers who have made their maiden speeches.  I congratulate Deputy Flanagan for temporarily becoming Leader of the Opposition in the House.  I thank Deputies for the kind comments they have made and for their good wishes in the coming months in the job I have been given.  I hope that the other measures I bring before the House get a similar welcome and similar support from Members.Several Deputies made the point that prison should be the last resort.  I agree with this as does the Government.  There are circumstances in which, due to the nature of the crime committed, it is absolutely appropriate and correct that people are sentenced to prison.  There are occasions when it is appropriate for the protection of the community that people are sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.  However, prison should be a last resort.  There are several circumstances in which short prison terms are imposed and which, I do not believe, benefits either the community or has any impact by way of rehabilitation on the person who is sentenced.I share the view that we have a substantial problem of recidivism which we must address.  This is in the interests of the wider community as well as those who come in touch with the prison services and who are involuntarily guests of the State in the prison system.  I realise Deputies share the goal of diverting from prison those for whom an alternative, non-custodial sentence is appropriate.  In that context, an analysis of the prison population has shown that the increase in prison numbers is primarily as a result of an increase in the number of persons who have been committed and sentenced to longer sentences for serious offences.  Although there has been an increase in committals for shorter sentences, it remains the case that our overall prison numbers, in the context of the rate of imprisonment, are on a par with the European average.In the context of the Government's programme, there is a commitment to delivering a sentencing system that provides a safer society at a lower cost to the taxpayer.  The Bill is one of several initiatives which, I hope, we can take, not all of which require legislative reform, to provide alternative methods of dealing with those convicted of crimes in respect of those who do not pose a risk to the community.  I intend to bring forward proposals to end the practice of imprisoning people who cannot pay fines or debts and to introduce a system of attachment orders allowing a small amount of money to be taken from wages or social welfare, facilitating the payment of debt or fines over time.  This, together with fully implementing the Fines Act 2010 and extending the use of community service orders form part of that commitment.I turn to some of the points raised by Deputies during the debate.  Several speakers have proposed that a provision should be included which would place a requirement on a judge, when opting to sentence a person to imprisonment as opposed to community service, to provide written reasons for that decision.  A similar proposal has been made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust which has carried out so much valuable work in this area.  I believe it is desirable that a judge gives reasons.  As many Deputies have pointed out in the context of this legislation the objective is to ensure that where a judge is considering imposing a prison sentence of 12 months or less as a consequence of a conviction, he or she should be obliged to and does direct his or her mind to the appropriateness of community service as an alternative.Giving reasons as to why one makes a choice on the part of the judge is of importance because it indicates that attention has been paid to this particular aspect of matters and it gives some insight to the general public in the context of the criminal justice system operating in public as to the circumstances in which, the Judiciary believes, it is appropriate that community service orders be applied and, in the alternative, the circumstances in which sentences of imprisonment are imposed and the reasoning behind the choice made.  However, I question the necessity of introducing a requirement to provide written reasons.  Without exception, a sentence of imprisonment should be reasoned and there is an obligation on all courts to give adequate reasons for their decisions.  There is a well established jurisprudence to this effect.  Practised reasons behind sentences are being clearly set out in our courts by our judges every day.  Should there be failure to do so, redress in the form of appeal and judicial review is available to the affected person.  Therefore, I am not yet convinced that further action in the context of the Bill is necessary but it is a matter that can be further teased out on Committee Stage.Another consideration is the resource implications the requirement to provide written reasons would create, especially at District Court level.  A balance between the benefits and any adverse implications must be achieved.  In the context of our giving additional consideration to this, we can discuss the matter on Committee Stage and further tease it out.  However, I am keen to ensure that we get over what appears to be the anomalous situation whereby one could readily identify within our court structure those District Courts within the State where it is more likely that community service orders would be made than others.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I must be careful of the extent to which I comment on the issue because, under the Constitution, the Judiciary is independent and it cannot be influenced by what I say.  However, it must apply legislation enacted by the House.  In the context of dealing with the issue of community service orders I am keen to see a uniform approach, in so far as it is possible, taken by the Judiciary throughout the country.One of the issues about which we must always be careful as Deputies is that in the context of the media reporting of court cases, there is often only a limited amount of information given.  Cases that appear similar in which sentences are imposed for an offence that has been committed are often rather different.  In the context of the events surrounding the offence, the impact of the offence or in the context of assessing an appropriate sentence, the background of the individual offender can substantially influence the discretion exercised by a judge.  The factors that have been applied in that context are not always published and are not always part of the public consideration of the appropriate sentences.  I assume in the context of dealing with community services orders that there should be a uniform approach to the judicial consideration given as to when the making of such orders is appropriate.  The Bill, when enacted, will ensure the Judiciary focuses on the issue.On the capacity and resources of the Probation Service, I assure Deputies I am fully satisfied that increased reliance on community service can be met within existing resources.  I inquired into this specifically some time prior to my appointment as Minister.  In the summer of 2010 I first proposed on behalf of Fine Gael that legislation in this area should be changed in this way.  I deliberately held meetings to ensure there was capacity and if legislation of this nature was enacted, the Probation Service would be able to deal with it.  The Probation Service has recently separately advised my Department that it currently has the capacity to supervise the additional community service orders that will arise following enactment of the Bill.Many Deputies have said community service orders should only be used when appropriate.  This Bill does not and should not interfere with judicial discretion in sentencing.  It merely asks a sentencing judge, under certain circumstances, to consider the imposition of community service.  Nor do the provisions of this Bill preclude a judge when sentencing an offender from imposing any of the other available non-custodial sentencing options.  That has been put beyond doubt through the provisions in section 3(c) of the Bill.Deputies also stressed the need to ensure the suitability of an offender for community service is carefully considered.  Section 4 of the 1983 Act, as amended by this Bill, provides that a court will not make a community service order in respect of an offender unless the court considers the person suitable to perform work under such an order.  In making this determination, the court must give consideration to the offender's circumstances and the assessment report prepared by the probation officer.Deputy McNamara questioned the requirement for the consent of the offender to a community service order.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's comments, it is widely considered that to impose community service on an offender in circumstances where he or she did not consent to such an order could be regarded as punishment by compulsory labour, which is prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights.  I would be reluctant to remove this requirement without further consideration and advice.  In the context of seeking an offender's consent, it may be more readily given in circumstances where it is blatantly clear to an offender who has been convicted that the alternative is imprisonment.Requiring the consent of an offender also confirms his or her willingness to make a positive contribution to the community.  To force an offender to complete community service would most probably increase the likelihood of the offender breaching an order and, therefore, requiring it to be revoked and the offender dealt with in an alternative manner.  This involves the associated resource and financial implications of court applications, the issue of warrants and the involvement of the gardaí, with their time taken up in implementing a warrant.The Deputy also raised the issue that the Bill does not require judges to state the period of imprisonment the community service order is in lieu of.  When sentencing an individual to community service, the judge will specify the sentence to be served if the offender fails to complete the community service order.  In circumstances where an offender reneges on the order with regard to community service, the nature of the sentence that must be served is quite clear.Deputy O'Brien suggested that victim impact statements might form part of the assessment process when the court is considering making a community service order.  Our law already contains provision for consideration by the courts of victim impact assessments.  The Criminal Justice Act 1993, as amended, requires the court in all relevant cases to consider the effect of an offence on the victim.  For the purpose of Deputy O'Brien's proposal, no further legislative provision is required.That said, I have long been committed to promoting and supporting victims of crime.  As indicated in the programme for Government, I intend to introduce legislation to strengthen the rights of victims of crime and their families.  Victims of crime and their needs should be a focus of the justice system and I am determined through the enactment of victims legislation to ensure the proper status is afforded to those who suffer at the hands of criminals.  Victims legislation is in place in several countries and it is a major gap in our legislative structure that we do not have an overall Act detailing the rights and protections available to the victims of crime.Deputy Daly mentioned the need to ensure community service orders are not used to undermine real and proper jobs.  Community service does not replace paid employees; in assessing suitable community service projects, the Probation Service is careful not to undertake any work that might displace someone from paid employment.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh correctly listed the type of work that could be undertaken in the current circumstances.  Work at local level, particularly with local authorities, where there are not the resources or personnel to undertake some work, can quite properly be undertaken by way of community service to the benefit of the community.  This type of work undertaken is normally at community level, where resources will not be available to pay for the work done and that will remain the case.Deputy Cowen asked if persons sentenced to penalties other than community service might be able to appeal their sentence and seek a community service order instead.  Anyone who has a penalty imposed on him by the courts already has the right in law to appeal the decision.  It would be for an appellant court to determine if community service was an appropriate alternative to another sentence that had been imposed.A number of Deputies suggested community service orders could be augmented by the use of restorative justice.  The restorative justice schemes were referred to today and on earlier occasions during the debate.  Through the Probation Service, the Department already funds two restorative justice projects that have been the subject of comment during the course of the debate, one in Nenagh and another in Tallaght.  The Nenagh community restoration project is being extended to Limerick and Tipperary while the Tallaght restorative justice service will be extended to the Criminal Courts of Justice.  This expansion will test the model's ability to manage up to 100 adult offenders by community reparation and up to 300 by the restorative justice service.  The Probation Service will monitor, oversee and evaluate implementation of the schemes and will provide a report on the effectiveness and value for money of the model after a 12 month operational period.  If, as I expect, these schemes are a success, I hope they will be further expanded.Deputy Ó Cuív stated we should try to reduce the prison population and use alternative methods of sentencing.  I appreciate the support he has offered this Bill, along with that of others in Fianna Fáil.  I share Deputies' views and the debate on this Bill has been informed and mature.  The prison system is under pressure and there are people in prison who could have been better disposed of in other ways following their conviction.  I hope during my period as Minister for Justice and Equality that we bring about change in that regard in a manner that enjoys public support while not giving rise to public concern.  We must do this in a manner that focuses on reducing rates of recidivism.Prisoner training was mentioned by Deputies, including Deputy O'Brien.  There are training schemes in our prisons to provide skills to prisoners.  I intend, through the Irish Prison Service, to look at the expansion of these schemes and the extension of additional skills to those in prison that they may use after their release.  The fact that in the region of 440,000 people are unemployed adds an extra layer of difficulty for former prisoners who, while incarcerated, obtained training — which in normal economic circumstances would create for them the possibility of employment — from obtaining employment.  This extra layer must be confronted and addressed and it could well be the subject of further discussion in the House.A number of Members, including Deputy Ellis, referred to getting to the root of the causes of crime.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am under no illusion that solving the problems we have in the area of criminality can be achieved simply by the handing down of prison sentences or through disposals of people who are found guilty of crimes.  If one examines our prison population from the perspective of crimes which do not involve a terrorist dimension, one can identify the communities from which 90% to 95% of inmates come.  There is a link between the conditions and circumstances in which people live and the causes of crime.  There are, of course, many people who live in difficult social circumstances in communities which we would recognise as being deprived and who do not engage in criminality.  Too frequently, those within the communities to which I refer who do engage in criminality make life extremely difficulty for others in those communities.  Whereas there is a link, there is also an issue with regard to how people conduct themselves and exercise their choices.A number of other issues were raised during the debate.  Deputy Seán Kenny referred to Mountjoy Prison and suggested that it has not changed since he last visited it 20 years ago.  I am of the view that it has changed substantially.  Within ten days of my appointment as Minister, I visited the prison and noted the very substantial changes that have been effected there.  I wish to pay tribute to the new governor of Mountjoy Prison for the considerable work he has done in tackling some of the problems that exist within the prison.  The important work the governor has done deserves to be acknowledged.  We should also acknowledge the contribution made by the prison officers who work within that institution.  There is a changing environment within the prison.I look forward to the establishment of a joint Oireachtas committee on justice and defence.  When the latter comes into being, I hope its members will avail of the opportunity not just to visit Mountjoy Prison at some future date but also to visit some of the other prisons throughout the State.  It is important that Deputies and — when the new Seanad has been elected — Senators should be made aware of the good things that are happening and also the nature of any difficulties which have arisen and how such difficulties might be addressed over a period.Deputy O'Donovan referred to the need to ensure that the victims of crime will not in any way be intimidated by those who engage in criminal activity and who are undertaking community service.  It is certainly my understanding that the probation and welfare service, in considering where to place individuals in respect of community service, takes account of that type of problem.  In the context of community service, there may be particular occasions when someone who is the victim of a crime can obtain some remedial assistance from an individual who is required to do community service in circumstances in which — as assessed by the probation and welfare service — this would not give rise to difficulties.I appreciate the care and attention Deputies have given to this measure.  I hope Committee Stage will be taken very soon after the Easter recess.  The Bill may require amendment.  If Deputies have constructive amendments which they wish to propose with regard to the area of community service to which the Bill is confined, then I look forward to taking a somewhat different approach on Committee Stage than that which held sway for many years during the lifetime of the previous two Governments.  I see Committee Stage as an opportunity to facilitate Members of this House in truly acting as legislators and in contributing to the improvement of legislation.This is only a small Bill.  However, it is an important measure in the context of changing our approach and in signalling a new method of dealing with criminal justice issues.  I will welcome any constructive amendments which Deputies may wish to bring forward.For the information of Deputies, I want to highlight a matter in respect of which we may engage in further discussion.  I am giving consideration to extending the use of community service in another circumstance.  A legislative change may not be required in this regard but I have asked my officials to consider the position.  As Deputies will be aware, the parole board currently operates as a non-statutory agency.  It is my hope to bring forward legislation to place the board on a statutory footing.  It may not be possible to introduce the relevant legislation this year but it may be possible to do so next year.  At present, the board's remit involves considering granting parole to those who are sentenced for serious offences where the sentence is for a period of seven years or more.  I am examining the possibility of allowing the board to consider granting parole to those who are sentenced to terms of five years or more, with the possibility of its requiring those granted parole to undertake community service for a period following their release.  This may require a statutory change in the context of the parole board, although it may be possible to deal with that issue by way of prisoners granted parole being required to undertake community service subject to conditions.  In other words, it will be a condition of the release that the prisoner engages in community service.  As is the case where someone fails to comply with certain conditions of his or her parole, if a prisoner fails to comply with a community service requirement of his or her parole, he or she would be returned to prison.There are a number of ways in which we can use the concept of community service as both an alternative to prison and as a means of reintroducing prisoners who pose no threat to people to their communities in a manner which benefits those communities and which saves taxpayers' money.  This is an issue which we might, perhaps, tease out further on Committee Stage.  I again thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.

We worked together very closely in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.The Government's aid programme has always had broad cross-party and public support.  It reflects our values as a people, and is central to Ireland's foreign policy.  The aid programme has built on years of effort by courageous individual Irish people.  It is now recognised internationally for its focus on the fight against global poverty and hunger and for its leadership in making aid more effective, especially in the poorest countries in Africa.The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's development programme and to Ireland's role internationally in helping to achieve the millennium development goals.  Our programme for Government states clearly our commitment to the 0.7% GNP target, and to seeking to achieve it by 2015.  This is in line with the long-standing UN target for official development assistance and with the commitment of the European Union.It is clear that, in current circumstances, this will be a challenging target to meet.  However, the Government was elected to face up to the challenges of rebuilding our society and our economy and of restoring economic growth and our international reputation.  I believe we can do this without undermining our work to improve the lives of some of the world's poorest people.The Irish people have always shown great generosity to those less fortunate than ourselves.  In the current economic crisis, with pressure on domestic budgets and on international aid budgets, it is all the more important that our development programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, focuses rigorously on delivering results for the poorest people.  Over the coming year, we will review the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid in order to ensure that Ireland can make the strongest possible collective contribution to the fight against global poverty and hunger.As Minister of State responsible for development, I intend to visit a number of our programme countries in Africa over the coming months to see the difference Ireland's work is making to the lives of poor families and communities and to assess how we can strengthen our contribution, especially in the area of hunger and undernutrition.

Tá mé ag súil le bheith ag comh-oibriú leo go héifeachtach san am atá romhainn.I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  She has my full support and the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party in doing everything she can to maintain Ireland's overseas aid programme, against the background of our own extremely difficult budgetary situation.  I readily acknowledge the scale of the challenge that confronts herself and the Minister in that regard.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle had the privilege of serving effectively in this area for a number of years, when the State was in a position to be more flaithiúlach than we are at present, regrettably.It is significant that we are considering this issue in the week when the Trócaire Lenten campaign nears an end, with its focus this year on development projects in Honduras.  Last year, this single campaign raised almost €11 million, which is a huge achievement.  Will the Minister of State join me in commending the outstanding input of Irish non-governmental agencies to the development aid process through their individual fund-raising efforts?Forecasts for economic growth have been revised downward by the Central Bank to 0.9% growth in GDP this year and to 2.2% growth in GDP in 2012.  Can the Minister of State clarify if this is significantly lower than the growth predictions on which the Irish Aid commitment in the programme for Government was based?The programme for Government states that we will review the 2006 White Paper on overseas development aid.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on what is intended in that review?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank Deputy Ó Fearghaíl and I acknowledge the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's contribution and that of my predecessor as Minister of State.I agree with the Deputy regarding NGOs, and particularly Trócaire.  I have already met them and Dóchas, which represents the various NGOs.  They have done excellent work and continue to do so.  Approximately 20% of the Irish Aid budget goes through NGOs to their work in various countries.With regard to reaching the 0.7% target for overseas aid, the amount that has been set aside this year is the amount it is intended to spend this year.  We do not know what national wealth will be in the years ahead.  While we are constantly striving towards the 0.7% target, we will not know the actual amounts until we see the outcome in respect of growth.  In 2010, Ireland contributed €675 million to official aid, most of it coming through Irish Aid.I have begun the process of reviewing the 2006 White Paper.  We intend to consult widely, particularly among NGOs but also among the people of Ireland.  The process will take a number of months because we want genuinely to consult the people.  We expect to have completed the review process within about a year.  I believe it will take that time for all of the consultations.

The resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peace building processes; the protection of women and girls in armed conflict; and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace building processes.Since February 2010, an extensive consultation process has taken place between representatives of Departments, the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána, civil society and academia.  An independent chair and drafter were appointed to this process in late 2010 and the final phase of consultation ended on 18 February this year, with the submission of a draft national action plan, prepared by Dr. Nata Duvvury.  We are very grateful for the work done by Dr. Duvvury, which will be the basis for the plan in its final form.My officials are currently collating observations received from other Departments on the draft prepared by Dr. Duvvury and it is my intention to submit the final version of the national action plan for approval by Government in the near future.Regarding the proposed system for monitoring and evaluation of the national action plan, my expectation is that a monitoring group will be formed to oversee progress on the implementation of Ireland's national action plan on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325.  This monitoring group would have a similar composition to the consultative group established to advise on the development of the national action plan and would also work with the appropriate Oireachtas committee to ensure involvement by parliamentarians.  The chair of the group would be independent and come from outside the Government system.

It is a very important process that underscores Ireland's commitment to international human rights.  One of the things of which we are most proud is the appointment of former President, Mary Robinson, as High Commissioner for Human Rights.The programme was to have been launched on International Women's Day on 8 March last.  With the collapse of the Government some time was lost in that process.  Is there a definite timeframe for commencement?  The Minister has outlined some of the oversight and regulation roles.  I would like to have a clearer sense of when it will be commenced and an assurance that it will not be long-fingered.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	234	As Deputy Mac Lochlainn said, there has been a considerable consultation process regarding the national action plan and considerable resources have been devoted to the process within the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments.In 2009, some €485,000 from the Department's stability fund funded a cross-learning initiative and consultation with women affected by conflict.  This is in addition to funding of €220,000 allocated to support international organisations, including UNIFAM, for their work on global indicators.  These resources were made available in addition to the considerable human and financial resources already devoted to resolution-related activities across Government.  The final figure for expenditure on activities related to UNSCR 1325 for 2010 is €412,000 approximately.A process has been under way since the draft was submitted on 18 February 2011.  Following the appointment of the new Government on 9 March 2011, which post-dated International Women's Day on 8 March, the conflict resolution unit of my Department carried out a thorough examination of the document prior to internal circulation on 23 March 2011.  Following receipt of observations, the revised draft was circulated to other Departments with a request for observations by 15 April 2011.  As I stated earlier, my officials are currently collating the observations received and I intend to submit the final version of the national action plan for approval by the Government in the near future.

I am broadly satisfied with the Minister's response.  I remind the House that the Minister's colleague, Deputy Howlin, speaking at the joint consortium annual event in November 2010, said that Ireland's national action plan should include a strong monitoring plan that is implemented effectively and ambitiously.  He said it should be particularly one that includes oversight by the Oireachtas and allows for "Opposition Members to hold the Government to account on this matter".  He also highlighted that "an adequate budget and sufficient resources were needed to take on its massive political task".  This is the commitment made by a now senior Minister and member of the Tánaiste's party.  He maintained it was the remit of the Opposition to hold the Government to account.  I am sure many respected non-governmental organisations monitor these situations to try to ensure that countries across the world honour their international commitments.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The development of the national action plan has been a collaborative process between civil society and Government.  I very much appreciate the role played by the joint consortium in acting as champions in Ireland for Resolution 1325.  For any national action plan to succeed, it will have to represent a balance between the high ambition we all have towards implementing the resolution and the resources which are available.  I believe the proposed monitoring and evaluation structure in the national action plan, which I outlined in general terms in my earlier response, builds on the proposals made by civil society and will guarantee this strong implementation and ownership across the government system.  Once the Oireachtas committees have been established, there will be an opportunity for Members to question and participate in the evaluation of the plan.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I am extremely concerned about the situation in Bahrain following a violent clampdown against protestors demanding political reforms in February and March and continued repression against those advocating reform.  Security forces from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation Council, have been deployed in Bahrain at the request of the Bahrain Government since 14 March.  A three month state of emergency was declared on 15 March.I am particularly worried about the unprovoked and disproportionate use of violence, including close-range lethal shootings of peaceful protestors and the detention of unarmed protestors.  I am also alarmed by reports of repression and attacks by the Bahraini armed forces against medical staff and institutions, such as Salmaniya Hospital, the main public hospital in Manama, during and after the recent protests.The EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 12 April, discussed the situation in Bahrain and adopted strong conclusions, which I fully support, reiterating our serious concern at the current situation and at the arrest of persons exercising their legitimate right to freedom of expression.  Ireland and its EU partners are urging an immediate investigation into recent events and the release of detained peaceful protestors.  We further call on the authorities and protestors in Bahrain to act with restraint and to begin an inclusive dialogue aimed at agreeing necessary political and economic reforms.  Such dialogue and reform is crucial if Bahrain is to emerge from its current difficulties.

Concern will not be sufficient for the people of Bahrain and neither are investigations sufficient.  A ruthless repression of pro-democracy protesters is taking place there.  In recent days, hundreds of the people who organised the pro-democracy protest, who were calling for nothing more than democracy——

The daughter of one of these people is on hunger strike in protest.  It is a brutal situation.  Saudi Arabia has been involved in supporting this regime.  I suggest we need more than expressions of concern from the European Union.  Ireland should challenge at European level and also with our US friends the unbelievable inconsistency of sending bombers to deal with one brutal dictatorship in Libya while doing nothing more than expressing concern and talking about investigations when it comes to the suppression of a democracy movement in Bahrain.  Is the inconsistency in this matter something to do with the fact that Ireland, the European Union in general and the western powers in general, have major trade links with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and in the case of the bigger European powers and the US are arming these regimes to the teeth?  This is why they want to do nothing to support actively the pro-democracy movements in Bahrain nor do they wish to take any serious action to restrain the authorities from crushing a pro-democracy movement.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	241	There is nothing inconsistent either in respect of Ireland's position or the EU position on Bahrain.  Ireland's position regarding Bahrain is that we are absolutely clear in our desire for an end to the repression.  The clampdown on peaceful protest and the way in which it has been treated is unacceptable.  The principles of democracy, the rule of law and the application of human rights are universal principles and there is no inconsistency nor any different approach as to how they are applied from one country to another.In a manner similar to the political upheaval which has occurred in other countries in the region, the protests in Bahrain arise from basic demands for political reforms, including a new constitution, an elected government, more equitable distribution of the country's wealth and the release of all political prisoners.  I reiterate my concern about the repressive targeting by the Bahrain Government of, in particular, medical staff and institutions.  There have been widespread reports, including by such respected bodies as Médecins Sans Frontières, of the takeover by the Bahraini security forces of medical centres and hospitals, of the arrest and detention of medical personnel such as doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers, the violent prevention of medical personnel attending to injured protesters and many other incidents.  These were the subject of discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 April and I expect they will be discussed again at the next meeting.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	242	What are we going to do about it?  What concrete actions are we going to call on them to take?  I do not believe bombing is the way forward in Libya, but I thought it was absolutely right for sanctions to be imposed on the Gadaffi regime for what it was doing to the pro-democracy movement in that country.  Why are we not calling clearly for sanctions to be imposed against Bahrain and against the regime in Saudi Arabia, which is actively involved in crushing the democracy movement in Bahrain?  I believe we are involved in joint economic commissions with countries like Saudi Arabia.  Our export trade with Bahrain is worth €27 million per annum.  We import some services and merchandise into this country from Bahrain.  Therefore, we have the muscle to do something.  The EU certainly has the muscle to impose sanctions against Bahrain and demand an end to this repression.  Why are we not making such clear and unequivocal calls?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The concerns that Ireland and other EU member states have expressed about the situation in Bahrain have clout for the reasons that have been mentioned.  As I have said, this matter was discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in April.  I expect it will be discussed again at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  If there is no response to the calls that have been made by Ireland, other member states and the EU as a whole, and if the repression continues in the way I have described, obviously the Foreign Affairs Council will have to consider other measures.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Ireland is supportive of Turkey's candidacy for EU membership and its accession when it fulfils all the established criteria and conditions of membership.  Our overall approach to EU enlargement is positive.  The broadening of the Union helps to promote stability, security and prosperity across the Continent.  In some cases, the process of preparing for membership can stimulate and bolster economic and political reforms.  Respect for the values set out in the treaties, rigorous conditionality and the need to take account of the capacity of the EU to integrate new members have to be factored into the process.  Accession is the result of negotiation.  The eventual outcome and timeframe in respect of any application cannot be predicted.  These factors shape the Government's supportive approach to Turkey's candidacy.Potential gains to the Single Market and to trade may accrue from the accession of a country of Turkey's size.  Given that its economy grew by 9% last year, Turkey is a significant economic and political player.  The Union's reach and influence in the Middle East and central Asia could be enhanced through Turkish accession.  The pace of progress on Turkey's application has been slow.  A number of obstacles to progress continue to exist.  Just 13 of the 35 negotiating chapters have been opened.  The current Hungarian Council Presidency is making a significant effort to have the chapter on competition opened before the end of June.  A significant constraint on progress is Turkey's continued failure to implement the Ankara Protocol, under which it would open ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus, and to normalise relations with Cyprus.  This issue is tied up with the unresolved Cyprus problem.  We support the UN-sponsored negotiations that are attempting to establish a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement.  The reforms within Turkey that are required under the accession process are proceeding, albeit more slowly of late in part due to upcoming parliamentary elections.  The accession negotiations continue to provide a strong incentive for Turkey to pursue reforms, strengthen democracy and human rights and further modernise the country.

Does he agree that the EU has enjoyed a long and close relationship with Turkey?  The question of Turkey's accession to the EU is a controversial one, to say the least.  It has been particularly protracted.  The Minister referred to the lack of progress with the 35-chapter acquis.  It seems that the negotiations will continue for another decade, at least.  Is the Minister concerned about the lack of unity among our EU partners on this matter?  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has promised to fight for Turkish membership of the Union.  Chancellor Merkel has opposed full membership.  Mr. Berlusconi has advocated the acceleration of Turkey’s application.  President Sarkozy opposes the accession of Turkey because he does not think Turkey belongs in Europe at all.  Most of the landmass of Turkey is in Asia Minor and just 3% of it is in Europe.  Fianna Fáil supports Turkey’s accession subject to its compliance with the various conditions, including the implementation of the Ankara Protocol.  In addition, I suggest we should conduct an effective analysis of the impact of Turkish membership of the EU on this country’s labour market.

The question of Turkey's accession to the Union will depend on its ability to meet the conditions for accession to membership.  As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl is aware, such conditions relate inter alia to politics, human rights and compliance with international agreements.  The process of accession is at an early stage.  I do not think it is simply a question of some countries agreeing with it and others not agreeing with it.  At this stage, it is a question of compliance with the conditions that attach to EU membership.  To date, discussions have been completed in respect of just one of the 35 chapters.  It is likely that the discussions and negotiations on Turkey’s accession will take some time.  We will have to wait to see the pace of those negotiations following the parliamentary elections in Turkey.

Can the Minister indicate whether the Minister of State's views, which may be understandable in the circumstances, reflect his own views and those of the Government as a whole?  Can he comment on the current significance of the trade relationships that exist between Ireland and Turkey?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	248	As I have said, the Irish position and the Government's position on Turkey's candidacy is that we support it.  Certain conditions have to be met before any country can accede to the EU.  Those conditions have to be fully met, clearly, as there cannot be a kind of partial meeting of the conditions.  The process by which they are negotiated is at an early stage.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I have not yet made plans to visit Israel, Palestine or Gaza, but I intend to see the conditions there for myself in due course.  Ireland has been active on this issue.  I will continue to work to maintain a focus on it at EU level.  There are three broad areas of concern with regard to Gaza, the first of which is the ongoing Israeli blockade.  This has eased a little since last year, with some increase in materials allowed in and a small beginning in allowing some exports.  Essentially, just a fraction of the needs of the territory are being allowed in or out.  Much more needs to be done and more quickly.Second, I have been deeply concerned by the worrying rise in violent exchanges across the Gaza border in recent weeks.  These have included not only Israeli attacks into Gaza, in which 17 people are believed to have been killed, including civilians, but also continuing indiscriminate rocket and mortar attacks by Hamas and other militants against civilian targets in Israel, including a deliberate attack by an anti-tank missile on a school bus in Israel, which injured a 16 year old boy who died last Sunday.  While some measure of calm has returned in recent days, a complete ceasefire seems as far away as ever.Third, there is the exclusion from Gaza of the Palestinian Authority and its control by Hamas and other militant groups which pursue military acts of deviance that bring only disaster for all sides.  The need to end divisions and promote reconciliation among all Palestinians remains an important requirement if there is to be progress towards a comprehensive two-state solution.

The visit was cancelled because the safety of the visiting parliamentarians could not be guaranteed.  This says everything one needs to know about the gravity of the outrageous position in Gaza which is essentially an open air prison as a result of the actions of the Israeli state.  Time and again, Israel has ignored resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly and Security Council over the years.  The world sees the speedy actions taken in Libya and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett noted, to some degree people understand the actions being taken in that country, albeit not their extent.  It is outrageous that the international community has not made any interventions against Israel.The Minister referred to the death of a young teenager, Daniel Viflic, who died as a result of a missile fired from Gaza.  Two days earlier, Nidal Qdeih died along with her mother, Najah, when an Israeli missile struck their home.  In recent times, 50 people have lost their lives in Gaza and more than 170 have been killed by Israelis since Operation Cast Lead.  As the Minister will know, approximately 1,400 Palestinians were killed during that outrageous offensive by the Israeli state.The situation in Gaza must be a top priority for the Minister.  I urge him to travel immediately to Gaza and follow in the footsteps of his party's previous spokesperson on foreign affairs, Michael D. Higgins, and his ministerial predecessor, Deputy Martin.  It is imperative that he take a stand on this issue and travel to Gaza immediately to see for himself the circumstances on the ground and the impact of outrageous, illegal Israeli activity in the region, which the world has ignored.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	251	As I stated, it is my intention to visit the region as soon as I can arrange a visit in my timetable to see the situation on the ground.  The matter is very much a priority for the Government's approach to foreign affairs and foreign policy.  I have made clear to my colleagues at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council that Ireland wishes this issue to be pursued more actively and wants the European Union to take a more active interest in it.  As the Deputy noted, the fact that this has been an ongoing, long-standing problem should not be a reason to leave it to one side.  The position in Gaza is serious.  The blockade which has been placed on Gaza should not continue and we have repeatedly called for its removal.We want to see an end to the continuing exchange of hostilities between Hamas and Israel and the killings, loss of life and injury that is occurring.  I assure the Deputy that this matter is a high priority for me and the Government and we will do everything we possibly can to make our contribution to try to bring a resolution to the conflict.

Notwithstanding any other initiatives he must make in the region, I call on him to ensure they include visiting Gaza to observe the impact of the blockade.  I also call on him to condemn the ongoing actions of the Israeli state.  The ongoing aggressive development of settlements is illegal and offensive and runs contrary to all international resolutions and instructions.  It is important that the Minister condemns the Israeli state.The Minister mentioned the death of a 16 year old who was killed by a Hamas missile.  All of us want a peaceful resolution to the conflict but in terms of scale the Israeli state has killed 50 people recently and 170 people since the end of Operation Cast Lead which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,300 people over a number of weeks.  It is not good enough to call for an end to hostilities.  It is important to take a stand by telling the Israeli state its behaviour is reprehensible and must be condemned by Ireland, Irish people and the international community.  I urge the Minister to condemn the ongoing actions of the Israeli state in Gaza.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The State is absolutely opposed to Israel's use of aerial weapons in attacks on Gaza.  These inevitably lead, as they have done, to uninvolved civilians being injured or killed.  We have also been critical of Israel for not taking political initiatives to try to end the cycle of violence by reaching a comprehensive peace.  We must recognise, however, that firing is taking place in both directions.  While Hamas and others in Gaza continue to fire rockets and mortars at what are clearly civilian targets, Israel will inevitably defend itself.  Clearly, this cannot be done indiscriminately or disproportionately.  I do not have any hesitation in condemning attacks in whatever direction which kill civilians.  As I stated, the blockade that has been imposed is absolutely unacceptable and it is an issue to which I am giving priority.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	254	In keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, over the coming months I plan to explore options for the establishment of a civilian corps which could allow some jobseekers to use and share their skills in developing countries while retaining some jobseeker's benefit.Support for volunteering has always been strong in Ireland.  Much of the achievement and the strong international reputation of our development programme is built on the contribution of generations of courageous Irish volunteers and missionaries who worked to improve the lives of the world's poorest people.  The volunteering experience today contributes to young people's personal and professional development, while providing skills and expertise that complement those existing on the ground.Since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, I have begun a process of dialogue with the Irish development non-governmental organisations, both collectively and individually.  I hope to meet shortly with the main organisations which send volunteers to work in developing countries.  I will explore with them how people who have become unemployed or cannot find employment in Ireland could most usefully play a role in international development, if they wish to do so.The focus of the Government's aid programme is on the fight against poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world.  It is strongly concentrated in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Through the aid programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government is currently funding the work of about 1,300 development workers, volunteers and missionaries in developing countries.  In addition, Ireland's rapid response corps, established by Irish Aid, enables those with specific skills to deploy swiftly in humanitarian crises.  I am also examining a pilot initiative at European Union level to develop a European voluntary humanitarian aid corps.It is clear that volunteers can have a very important role to play as part of Ireland's overall contribution to development.  I want to ensure we can build on the contribution already being made by individual Irish volunteers in the most effective, relevant and safest manner possible.

Is it envisaged that jobseekers will arrange work through the Department or Irish Aid or will they liaise directly with the relevant charities and organisations?  Does the Minister of State have a timescale for engaging with organisations such as GOAL and Trócaire to obtain their input into what appears to be an excellent plan?  Will this be part of the jobs initiative — perhaps I should refer to it as a jobs budget — which the Government will announce in the next month or thereabouts?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I do not mind whether the Deputy calls it the jobs budget or jobs initiative.  I welcome his support for this proposal.  In reply to his earlier question, I have begun to consult and have met the board of Dóchas, an umbrella organisation for all the various bodies, to discuss how this might work.  I also met Trócaire and I plan to meet within the next few weeks the various other organisations such as Concern, GOAL and Misean Cara, which represents the missionaries.  We already have the mechanism of going through those kinds of bodies.  Voluntary Service Overseas is another major organisation for volunteering and it would seem a good channel to use as we know it works well.With regard to establishing a new mechanism, I am not sure any of us would wish to begin setting up new bodies or organisations, and I would probably be condemned if I suggested that.  Primarily, we want to use what we already have.  I point out that Irish Aid has a volunteering and information centre on O'Connell Street, Dublin.  I would advise anybody who wishes to access information on volunteering to visit the centre, which is in an obvious location with a big shop front-type window.I do not envisage this will be a specific proposal in the jobs initiative or jobs budget.  Frankly, I do not believe it will be ready for that time and those proposals will largely relate to other areas of job creation.  We certainly intend to develop this.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Ireland's long-standing concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza is well known.  As I stated in my reply to the priority question on Gaza, the slight relaxation of the terms of the blockade in the last year has been completely insufficient.  Along with our EU partners, we are continuing to press for a full opening up of the border crossings into Gaza to allow unimpeded flows of humanitarian aid, and normal commercial and human traffic.I recognise the essentially humanitarian motivation which gave rise to last year's Gaza flotilla and also to the further flotilla now being planned.  We will continue to press Israel to do all possible to facilitate those wishing to transport humanitarian goods to Gaza and, in particular, to avoid any repetition of the unacceptable use of force against last year's flotilla.However, my Department's essential travel advice remains that people should not attempt to sail to Gaza at the present time and certainly should not attempt to break through a naval blockade of the kind which Israel has imposed on Gaza.  I am deeply concerned that there is real potential for a similar disastrous outcome this year.  The Deputy will understand that I cannot support a project which would involve Irish citizens engaging in actions which could lead them into real danger.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider this issue.  The more widespread and prominent the support that is given to the flotilla, the greater chance it has of getting through and bringing aid and support to the besieged people of Gaza.  If, for example, there was a Government representative on board one of those ships, it would make it far less likely that Israel would attack it.  For that reason, the Tánaiste should reconsider and the Government should put representatives on one of those boats.  The situation is intolerable for the people of Gaza, as the Tánaiste acknowledged and as most people understand.In July of last year, Deputy Joe Costello and Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, Labour Party MEP, asked the previous Attorney General to exercise his duty under Irish legislation and the Geneva Convention to bring charges against those who were suspected of war crimes in regard to Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli assault on Gaza and the attack on the flotilla.  Now that Deputy Gilmore is in government, will he follow through on that and initiate such proceedings against Israel?  Deputy Costello and Mr. De Rossa said it could be done unilaterally in this country so will the Tánaiste do it, as he should?While no one wants to see bombs or bullets going in either direction, as the Tánaiste said, will he state clearly that there is no equivalence in this situation between one and the other?  The basic problem is that Israel refused to accept the outcome of elections in Gaza in 2006 which were acknowledged to be democratic, free and fair.  Its refusal to do that lies at the root of the problem and of the siege that followed.  Will the Tánaiste state clearly that this is the root of the problem?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	259	My Department has a responsibility to provide travel advice to Irish citizens irrespective of where they are travelling.  If somebody wants to travel somewhere, the Department of Foreign Affairs provides a service whereby travel advice is provided as to whether it is safe to travel.  I want to make it absolutely clear that the Department's travel advice in respect of the proposed flotilla to Gaza is that it is not safe.  We will not encourage Irish citizens to participate in a travel venture where there is a naval blockade and where, as we saw last year, people were killed in that exercise.  We have to underline responsibly that it is our view that this is not a safe venture.In respect of the question of the blockade, the Government's position is very clear.  The blockade of Gaza should end.  The flow of humanitarian aid, while it should not necessarily be brought in by sea, should be made available by opening up land border access to Gaza to ensure humanitarian aid and goods are enabled to be provided.

The 1.5 million people of Gaza are living in an open-air prison.  The international community has stood idly by, with the exception of some honourable people in the NGOs and the United Nations.  The people of Gaza have been abandoned to a regime that borders on international terrorism in that Israel is almost a rogue state — that is the reality.  Peace activists from around the world, in the absence of actions by their Governments, are trying to bring in vital assistance to these people in an inspirational fashion, despite ten of those activists being murdered in the last effort.Despite that action, there has been a failure of the international community to respond and to be consistent in its approach to states that behave in this fashion.  As Governments will not intervene, there is now a scenario whereby good peace activists, who try to do their bit peacefully, are prevented from doing so.  What hope do they have if some Governments, first, will not stand up and condemn Israel solely for its actions, second, will not intervene in any shape or form, and, third, advise those good peace activists who want to do something about this that they should not intervene?  They have been utterly abandoned.How is it we cannot assist the beleaguered, imprisoned people of Gaza in some way?  What hope can we give them?  What leadership can be given by the Irish Government, which is respected internationally in regard to human rights?  We must deal with this issue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	261	We need to do something; words are not enough.  The Tánaiste did not indicate whether the Government will follow through on the call by his party colleagues, Deputy Costello and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, to bring charges against Israel for its involvement in the brutal invasion of Gaza in 2006 and for its attack on the aid flotilla which was, by any standards, an illegal and immoral act of piracy by a rogue state trying to prevent badly needed aid and support from reaching the beleaguered and crucified people of Gaza.  Will there be more than words?  Will the Government condemn outright, forthrightly and unequivocally, Israel's brutal siege of the people of Gaza and its refusal to recognise free and fair elections?  Whatever we may think of who is elected, must we not say that Israel is obliged to recognise the outcome of free and fair elections among the people of Palestine, Gaza or anywhere else?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	262	As I said in response to an earlier question, this issue is very much a priority for me and for the Government.  I made clear at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on 12 April that the Government and I want to see this issue addressed by the council.Our view is that the blockade should not exist, that the situation in Gaza is absolutely intolerable, and that there is a necessity to allow humanitarian aid, building materials and so on into Gaza so that trade and other activities can continue.  It should not be the case that humanitarian aid to Gaza must be delivered by sea.  I have accepted and acknowledged the motivation of the people who are engaged in that, and I have made clear that the blockade should not apply.  I assure Deputies that this is an issue to which we will return.With regard to the comments made by Deputy Costello and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, I will have my Department review them.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 and accession negotiations were formally opened in July 2010.  In its most recent annual progress report on Iceland, published last November, the Commission stated that the overall level of Iceland's preparedness to meet EU legislative requirements is good.  Through its existing membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen Area Iceland is already closely integrated with the EU in many sectors and this significantly facilitates the negotiations.The process is currently at what is known as the "screening" phase, during which the Commission assesses the degree of compatibility of Iceland's laws with those of the EU.  At the next Intergovernmental Conference with Iceland, to be held on 27 June, it is expected that the EU Presidency will open a number of negotiation chapters with Iceland on which the screening process has been completed.  It is at this stage that actual negotiations can begin.  Based on this close relationship and on our own positive experience of enlargement in the past, Ireland supports the EU candidacy of Iceland, a country with which we have strong ties of geography, history, culture and politics.Accession is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted with precision.  Areas where significant differences between Icelandic law and EU law still exist and among those that can be expected to present challenges during the negotiations are fisheries, agriculture and rural development, environment including whaling, regional policy, and food safety including veterinary and phytosanitary regulations.Ireland will continue to play an active role in protecting our own and the EU's interests in respect of negotiations with Iceland.  In this regard we look forward to working closely with Iceland, with the European Commission and with our fellow member states to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the Icelandic accession negotiations that is of mutual benefit to Iceland and the EU.

Is he concerned that the dispute that has arisen between Iceland and the Dutch and British in terms of loan repayments is likely to emerge as a significant impediment to the advancement towards EU accession by Iceland?  Has he had discussions or does he intend to have discussions with his European partners on this matter?  What is his view on the recent statement by the Dutch Finance Minister, Jan Kees de Jager, that the Netherlands will block Iceland's bid to join the European Union unless the dispute over €1.3 billion in unpaid debts is resolved?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The collapse of Iceland's private banking sector in October 2008 developed into a diplomatic dispute when the United Kingdom and the Netherlands insisted that Iceland guarantee bank deposits of their citizens held in the collapsed Icelandic bank Icesave.  Both Governments provided loans to facilitate this guarantee and the dispute has since centred on the terms for repayment.The Icesave dispute had hampered progress towards the opening of accession negotiations with Iceland.  However, member states unanimously agreed at last June's European Council to proceed with the opening of formal talks.  The conclusions highlighted the need for Iceland to address existing obligations such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, surveillance authority under the Agreement on the European Economic Area.In a referendum on 9 April Icelandic citizens voted not to accept the terms of repayment negotiated between Iceland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  The matter will be now dealt with by the European Free Trade Association court.  Both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have expressed disappointment at the referendum result while stressing their commitment to recovering the loans.  The Icelandic Government has stressed that the referendum result will not affect its application for EU membership.  The European Commission, meanwhile, has described the issue as a bilateral matter which must be resolved outside of EU negotiation process.  However, it is expected that the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will be reluctant to allow EU membership negotiations to conclude until the Icesave issue has been dealt with to their satisfaction.

Icelandic voters were allowed to have their say and that gave their Government a stronger hand in negotiations on how to deal with their banking crisis.  The demand of the people, expressed in two referenda, that the bondholders should pay some of the cost offers lessons to us.  Does the Tánaiste agree that one lesson from the situation following those referenda is that the sky did not fall on the heads of the people of Iceland?  Negotiations continue and the country is probably in a stronger position as a result of the people being allowed to express their view in a referendum.  Perhaps we should consider doing the same.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Ireland's situation is quite different from that of Iceland which concerns a bilateral dispute between Iceland and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands regarding the loss of private depositor funds guaranteed under EFTA rules and whether Iceland should recover such losses.  Iceland's referendum concerned this issue specifically and was not linked to the programme of support which the Icelandic Government negotiated with the IMF.  Iceland has confirmed that it remains committed to the IMF programme, which is progressing well.The issue was best summarised in a recent editorial in The Irish Times which states:Despite the two Icelandic referendum results its elected Government did not unilaterally abandon legal obligations but rather sought to negotiate the best available deal.  The country is still bound up with the international system and seeks to enhance that position by joining the EU.If the bilateral difficulties Iceland has with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are not concluded to the satisfaction of those countries, the latter may veto their accession to the EU.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Sanctions against Burma were renewed for a further 12 months at the April session of the Foreign Affairs Council.  Ireland was to the fore in the preparation of this decision, arguing for the extension of restrictive measures by the European Union.  In taking this decision, Ministers were very much aware of the views of Aung San Suu Kyi.  By renewing sanctions, the European Union has maintained the prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export of equipment and technology to enterprises in Burma engaged in logging and timber processing, mining and processing of specified natural resources, semi-precious and precious stones.  The purchase, import or transport of products from these industries into the European Union is also prohibited.Under the restrictive measures, the visa ban and asset freeze remain in place against a specified list of individuals with links to the regime, including all members of the new Burmese Government who were appointed following the deeply flawed parliamentary elections last year.  However, to allow for the pursuit of constructive engagement with the new Government, Ministers agreed to suspend imposition of the restrictive measures in the specific cases of the Burmese Foreign Minister and those new Government appointees who do not have military backgrounds.  In renewing sanctions, Ministers reiterated their commitment to the people of Burma and demanded the release of all political prisoners and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma.While Ireland is a strong supporter of maintaining sanctions until genuine progress on human rights and political reform takes place, we do not view sanctions as an end in themselves.  The European Union stands ready to respond positively to genuine progress towards democratisation and respect for human rights and this must include full respect for the rights of all of Burma's ethnic minorities.

While I welcome the Tánaiste's response, to clarify, is he aware of plans among his colleagues at European Union level to visit Burma to engage directly with Aung San Suu Kyi or her political party?  Might it be envisaged that an invitation be extended to Mme Suu Kyi to visit Europe or Ireland, given the many admirers she has both here and throughout Europe?

However, it was agreed that any such visits must be carefully co-ordinated in Brussels with defined terms of reference.  Delegations visiting Burma must also be allowed to meet Burmese opposition and civil society leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi.  While I have no plans at present to visit Burma, I will keep the matter under review.

As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl observed, she is a lady who is hugely respected worldwide as a Nobel peace prize winner and an inspirational person.  Almost single-handedly, she has drawn international attention to the reprehensible actions of that regime.  My difficulty is that while the European Union has opened up the door to Burma and has bilateral agreements with Israel, in contrast it has a common agreement arrangement whereby all trade with Cuba basically is blocked.  Any international observer observing what is taking place in Cuba will note it has one of the best health systems in the world, one of the greatest education systems in the world and the highest level of literacy in the world under UNESCO——

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I welcome the Tánaiste's support and commitment for sanctions against the Burmese dictatorship and in support of Aung San Suu Kyi.  As has been noted, she is an inspirational figure and her campaigning and that of her supporters have brought pressure to bear on Burma to an extent.  However, I refer to the issue of consistency and double standards in another regard.  Should the Government, within the European Union, not call for sanctions equally as much against any despotic dictatorship that systematically denies democratic and civil rights to its citizens or ruthlessly suppresses political opposition?  Should it not call specifically for sanctions and be a voice calling loudly within the European Union for sanctions just like those imposed on Burma?  In this regard, I refer in particular to demanding an end to arms sales by Western and European Governments to regimes such as those in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Libya when Gadaffi was the West's friend and so on.

My reply was that sanctions have been renewed against Burma.  A small exception or derogation has been made regarding the sanctions that apply to visas, travel restrictions and so on in respect of the Burmese Foreign Minister and a small number of Ministers who were not part of the previous military regime with a view to opening up dialogue with the Burmese regime to emphasise the importance of human rights, respect for democracy and the role that Aung San Suu Kyi and others who have been involved in civil society have played in that country.  That is the position taken by Ireland and the European Union.I am quite happy to respond to questions on Cuba or anywhere else if Members wish to table them.  However, when a question is tabled on sanctions in respect of an individual country and I give the answer, thereby confirming that the European Union has continued its actions, it is not the most constructive of approaches to state, "Fine, you have done Burma, now why do you not do everywhere else?".

As stated in my earlier reply to Question No. 2, the resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peace building processes, the protection of women and girls in armed conflict and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace building processes.  In developing our NAP, a wide-ranging consultation process took place involving Departments and Government agencies, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, as well as representatives of civil society and academia.  A comprehensive audit of Government activity in the areas covered by the resolution was conducted and civil society engaged in a consultative process with women affected by conflict in Ireland.I agree with the Deputy that our NAP should include a monitoring and evaluation process that allows progress in implementing the plan to be tracked.  I envisage recommending the establishment of a monitoring group whose membership would be reflective of all agencies working in the areas covered by the Security Council resolution, both in Government and civil society.  Once the Oireachtas has completed the process of the establishment of its committees, my officials would then engage with the appropriate committee with a view to ensuring that the Oireachtas is informed on progress in implementing the NAP.

However, I seek some specific information from the Tánaiste.  What level of organisation will the Department of Foreign Affairs commit to this?  Overseeing the implementation of the plan across the areas required is a significant task.  Will a full-time or part-time person be allocated?  Regarding the role of parliamentarians in the accountability process, the Tánaiste referred to liaising with the committees following their establishment, but what will our function be and how regularly will the implementation of this matter be monitored by us?

As I indicated in my response to another question, we must strike a balance between our aspirations in the national action plan and what is practically feasible.  The issues we are considering are the practical implications of the plan's implementation.  I sought for and received the opinions of various Departments in this regard.  After we finalise the plan, it will be brought to the Government and then made known.  I envisage a monitoring and evaluation process, one in which the range of interests involved in the consultative process will be involved.  I also envisage that the monitoring and evaluation will be subject to one of the Oireachtas committees after their establishment.

As one of the 48 countries that contribute to ISAF, Ireland attended the ISAF meeting.  The EU and the special representative of the UN Secretary General in Afghanistan also attended the meeting.  Ireland was represented at official level and our delegation was headed by the political director of my Department.The meeting confirmed the support of ISAF-contributing countries for the transition of seven areas to Afghan security control.  This is the first tranche of the transition process announced by President Karzai last month.  The aim of transition is to hand over security control to the Afghan army and police.  This will be done in stages, accompanied by training and mentoring for the Afghan forces, which will become the focus of ISAF's work.  The process should be completed by the end of 2014.The meeting endorsed the strategy for the first tranche of transition, which has been designed jointly with Afghan partners.  In addition, contributors underlined the importance of significantly increased political and diplomatic efforts to secure lasting peace in Afghanistan.  This includes support for the process of reconciliation launched by President Karzai's High Peace Council last year.

The force has a UN mandate, one that has been renewed annually since 2001.  The current mandate was extended until 13 October 2011 by Resolution 1943 and enjoys the support of the 48 participating ISAF countries.  ISAF's goal is to help restore security in Afghanistan, which is crucial if normal life is to be restored for people who have suffered a long-term conflict and if there is to be broader regional stability.  The Irish contingent consists of seven members of the Defence Forces who are based at ISAF's headquarters in Kabul in non-combatant roles.  In addition, Ireland has deployed civilian personnel with the EU police training mission.  Ireland is also devoting considerable effort to economic development and reconstruction.  Since 2007, Irish Aid has allocated more than €24 million in relief, recovery and development assistance to Afghanistan.  More generally, the EU spends close to €1 billion per year on various civilian, political and development activities.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate

There is no doubt that one of the greatest issues facing society is the high level of unemployment and the urgent need for the Government and Opposition to work tirelessly together to implement policies and initiatives that will facilitate job creation.  I acknowledge the Government's commitment to laying a jobs initiative before the House in the next month, but one of the most important factors in job creation is infrastructure and, without critical infrastructure, we will not be able to attract inward investment to an area.  Who in their right mind will start up a business without the necessary infrastructure?  Without doubt, broadband is a critical piece of infrastructure.Looking at the Department's website I saw a press release from December 2010 welcoming the €223 million spent on the national broadband scheme.  According to the website, the service has a minimum download speed of 1.6Mbps and a maximum of 6.8Mbps with a contention ratio of 22:1.  It has been made available for 235,000 premises across every county in Ireland, creating 170 jobs in the process.  Built into the contract is a provision that speeds will be increased to a maximum of 10Mbps by October 2012.  This is most welcome but what about the areas outside the national broadband scheme or within that are just not been served?I question the accuracy of the Department figure of 99% coverage through the country and would ask the Minister if the number of new sites established under the scheme has reached the target of over 400 stated previously on the website, and, if not, how many new sites have been completed and are functioning correctly at present.  How many of those are masts supporting antennae in new locations?  In my own constituency, there are numerous black spots, including Abbeyshrule and Ballynacargy, which is home to me and a Cabinet member.  The village still has no adequate broadband and the Eircom exchange is not even enabled to provide broadband service.  Other villages affected include Ballymore, Ballinalack, Ballinamuck in Longford, Cloughan and Coralstown, Coole, Collinstown, Dysart, Dring, Fore, Forgony and Gaybrook.  Kenagh, where the recent electoral count was held, had a connection so bad that we found it hard to get out the news that I was elected.As I said already, broadband is not a luxury but a necessity for both business development and households.  We live in an age where more people are using the Internet to carry out daily tasks such as online shopping and banking.  Students are using it as a research tool and firms need it to carry out their daily business.  I know a case in Dring, County Longford, where a local bookmaker running a number of businesses from home has no broadband and cannot properly function.  A friend who is a solicitor contacted me recently because after building a new house in my home village, she is unable to get any broadband or work from home, thus causing severe problems for her family life.Despite the large-scale investment in the provision of broadband over the past number of years, areas remain without an adequate service.  I understand the previous Government before leaving office had committed €18 million for a new rural scheme to ensure outstanding areas would be serviced.  I conclude by asking if this scheme will proceed and, if so, how can the areas I listed qualify?  Are there plans to discuss with Eircom its obligation to ensure that exchanges are broadband-enabled and whether the subsidy of ongoing charges for satellite service provided under the national broadband scheme will be maintained after the current contract ends in July 2014?I would appreciate it if I did not get a history lesson on why this or that cannot be done because of what happened in the past 14 years.  I have been here five weeks and I would like to know what will happen in future.  I do not live in the past; I live in the present.  I want to work towards a better future.

I am reminded of the line from the poem, "i mBaile na Muc, Dé Sathairn, chailleamar an lá".  Sibhse a chaill an toghchán deireanach.  Cháin an Teachta cúrsaí leathanbhanda na tíre agus dúirt sé nach bhfuil leathanbhanda ag daoine ina cheantar féin.  Ta súil agam go dtuigeann an Teachta gur ar a phairtí atá an milleán faoi sin.I welcome very much what the Deputy has said about identifying the issues and the needs concerning broadband in his area.  It is an important issue and in the past five weeks I have spent as much time as possible on the matter.  The Deputy is correct in that it is unacceptable for people, whether living in his village or mine, not to have a proper broadband service.  The history lesson takes in the Deputy's party; it is a history of a failure to deliver broadband or the services which people want.  The difference between us is that this Government is committed to NewERA, which is a massive investment in broadband.  Together with private enterprise, State and semi-State agencies, it will ensure that the Deputy's village and the other townlands mentioned will have a proper broadband service.A note from Department officials has been circulated but I am happy to debate the key question of the rural broadband scheme in the time we have.  It is my intention in the next number of weeks to announce a new rural broadband scheme to reach those locations with no broadband whatever.  Depending on terrain, there may or may not be a broadband service.  With business and enterprise, the Government must work with everybody to have an efficient and effective broadband service around the country so that everybody can compete.The European target is that by 2020 there should be a 30Mbps broadband service in as many places as possible.  In the circulated response there is mention of three towns in the Deputy's constituency that have a metropolitan area network.  These are working but I point out — as I am sure the Deputy will — that we need everybody that can have a service in a metropolitan area network to avail of it.  I hope to work with the Deputy and our colleagues in the House to bring that about.  I am working with my Department officials on that plan as it is very important for us to have connectivity around the country and in metropolitan area networks to meet obvious needs.If the fibre optic cable is in the ground, it should not be forever unused, as it was under the previous Government.  We want to use the equipment fully.  The Deputy can read the rest of the circulated response but I hope he found this contribution helpful.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The Government must urgently review the proposed closure of the Kinsealy research centre and its relocation to a much smaller facility at Ashtown, County Dublin.  The important Teagasc facility at Kinsealy plays a critical role, as the Minister of State knows, in the horticulture and agrifood sector in Fingal and the north county.  Serious issues have been raised about the high cost of closing the facility.  Many constituents and Teagasc workers have argued that the proposal to close the centre will incur a significant net cost to the State at a time when we can least afford the burden of any extra or unnecessary costs.It has also been alleged that extraordinary costly mistakes have been made by Teagasc during this episode.  For example, it is alleged that property consultants missed the key submission date to the Fingal county development plan in what was an extraordinary lapse.  For these reasons I have contacted the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Buckley, to ask him to request that the Teagasc internal auditors submit an immediate report responding to these allegations.  I also asked him to carry out a full cost-benefit analysis on the closure and relocation of the centre to Ashtown.  On 12 April I received a letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General stating that he "has asked the audit group completing the financial audit of Teagasc to make preliminary inquiries" and that he will "review the outcome as soon as they have been made".  It would be extraordinarily premature for Teagasc to move ahead with the closure of Kinsealy given the involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the prospect of a report being published on serious auditing of financial matters surrounding the proposed closure.As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Reilly, knows, the Kinsealy Teagasc centre is a vital agricultural and horticultural research station for north County Dublin and its wider environs.  Fingal has a strong farming tradition and the horticultural sector here is critical to local, mid-Leinster and national economies.  For example, I understand very important research was developed at the centre relating to the valuable mushroom production sector in some of the northern counties.Some 85 people are now employed at the Kinsealy centre, and it has an important mandate for ensuring that the long-term competitiveness and dynamism of Irish horticulture continues.  I understand the Kinsealy centre also has close research links with scientific staff at the world-class Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin.In late 2009, just before Christmas, staff at the Kinsealy centre were shocked to discover that there were plans afoot to shut their research station down and relocate staff to Ashtown and other Teagasc facilities across the country.  As the Minister of State knows, it is a big site of 100 acres plus.  It was then that constituents who are also Teagasc staff first came to meet me to express concerns about the closure.  Several were rightly fearful that they would be forced to move across the county or the country even though they and their families had deep roots in Fingal, in the Minister's constituency and mine, and throughout the north county.  I continually pursued the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, on this matter, and was disappointed with the performance of the outgoing Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture, Trevor Sargent of the Green Party who, despite representing the area, seemed to do little or nothing for the welfare of these workers and the important work they do for our country.During the 30th Dáil, as the Acting Chairman knows, I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and I asked the committee to examine the value for money to the State of the potential closure of the Kinsealy centre.  I understand the clerk of the committee contacted Professor Gerry Boyle, the director of Teagasc, at the Carlow headquarters and asked him to provide details of any cost-benefit analysis undertaken before the closure plans were developed.  As far as I understand, Professor Boyle and the Teagasc senior management team have never provided this information to the committee or to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Can the Minister indicate whether he has seen the details of any cost-benefit analysis?  What are the costs and benefits of relocating from Kinsealy to Ashtown?  What is the economic justification for closing down such a vital and historic facility in modern Irish agriculture?For all these reasons, the Minister should insist on an immediate moratorium on all plans by Teagasc to shut down the Kinsealy centre until the outcome of the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General is known.  I understand that a decision some time ago to close the Teagasc facility in Naas, County Kildare, was ultimately reversed, and I ask the Minister to ensure, similarly, that the proposal for our Kinsealy station is reversed.

I would like to clarify the position with regard to the respective responsibilities of Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Under the Act establishing Teagasc, the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, Teagasc has statutory responsibility for the provision of education, advisory and research services to the agriculture sector.  It develops its programmes, services and activities in conjunction with its clients and partners, overseen by an authority that is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agrifood sector.  It is a matter for Teagasc and its board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities.As far as my Department is concerned, ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act, and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.  Accordingly, decisions relating to the future of the Kinsealy centre or any other research centres or advisory offices are operational matters for the Teagasc authority to consider.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for me to interfere in decisions made by the Teagasc authority about the Kinsealy centre.I am aware that the Teagasc authority approved a major change programme in 2009, reorganising and refocusing the organisation to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead.  The programme provided for rationalisation measures across the organisation, including changes in the advisory office network and research centres, the disposal of surplus land and staff reductions.  The agreed actions were seen as the first step in an ongoing process of change.  The programme was updated in May 2010 to incorporate additional rationalisation measures to the end of 2012.As part of this change strategy, Teagasc decided to move the activities and staff based in Kinsealy to other locations, with the majority transferring to the Teagasc campus in Ashtown.  I understand that Teagasc took the decision to close the Kinsealy centre for a number of reasons.  It currently has four centres in the greater Dublin area — Grange, Botanic Gardens, Ashtown and Kinsealy — and Teagasc has concluded that it does not make economic sense to maintain all of these sites.  Many of the facilities in Kinsealy are ageing and the move to Ashtown offsets the need to invest in these facilities.  I understand Teagasc has developed excellent facilities in Ashtown following a €10 million investment programme in recent years.  The move provides the opportunity to optimise the usage of this valuable centre.  In addition, there are considerable savings in overhead costs and staff costs to be achieved from operating at one site.  For example, Kinsealy education and research programmes can be delivered effectively from Ashtown and other Teagasc locations.Teagasc has stressed that the decision to relocate horticulture services from Kinsealy will not have a negative impact on its support for the horticulture sector.  It points out that most of the permanent staff located in Kinsealy are not involved in horticulture and could operate from other Teagasc centres.  There are only three permanent horticulture and forestry researchers working in Kinsealy.Teagasc has produced a comprehensive horticultural plan which outlines an alternative model for horticultural research that is less dependent on the traditional type of research infrastructure.  Following preparation of the plan, Teagasc is satisfied that the needs of the programme can be adequately met by the facilities proposed for Ashtown and by conducting more research on producer sites.  It plans to service the horticultural education programme from the new Teagasc facility in the Botanic Gardens and the training centre in Ashtown, with the addition of some new facilities.  It is investing €2.5 million to upgrade educational facilities in the Botanic Gardens, and this will cater for many of the Kinsealy educational staff and students.For strategic reasons, Teagasc considers it essential that it retains a presence in the Botanic Gardens.  The Botanic Gardens brand is hugely important for the standing of the college and its courses.  Teagasc plans to meet the needs of the forestry programme through a combination of new and existing facilities at Ashtown and through the exploitation of other Teagasc locations.I understand that Teagasc has carefully assessed the potential investment attributable to relocating from Kinsealy to Ashtown, and that this is estimated to be €4.8 million.  The actual costs will depend on the outcome of any competitive tendering processes.  Teagasc estimates that overhead savings of approximately €300,000 per annum can be achieved through moving to Ashtown.  The amalgamation and streamlining of services at Ashtown is expected to yield further annual savings of approximately €240,000.  In addition, savings on the upgrading of facilities and equipment are expected to be €200,000 per annum, or €1.4 million over seven years, on the assumption that the facilities in Kinsealy would have to be upgraded to bring them into line with those proposed for Ashtown.Teagasc is satisfied that the closure of the Kinsealy campus will give rise to significant annual cost savings.  It confidently expects a payback arising from relocation savings over an acceptable seven-year period.  Teagasc is substantially dependent on taxpayer-funded resources to deliver on its statutory mandate.  In the current economic circumstances, it has had to explore every conceivable option to minimise the Exchequer contribution.  It embarked on an extensive rationalisation programme in 2009 to respond to these constraints in a manner that minimises any adverse impact on its services and programmes.  The move from Kinsealy to Ashtown is consistent with the aims of the rationalisation programme to reduce organisational overheads and achieve greater efficiencies.The Teagasc authority has concluded that the Kinsealy campus is no longer a strategic site for the organisation and that programmes and staff can be accommodated in Ashtown and other Teagasc sites.  I reiterate that this is an operational matter for Teagasc.  It is entirely within its rights to make this decision, and it would not be appropriate for the Minister of the day or the Department to interfere in the matter.  I will bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the Minister.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	303	On Wednesday morning, during Leaders' Questions, Deputy Finian McGrath sought clarification from the Taoiseach on the statement issued by the HSE last Wednesday week that the 34 promised isolation beds for cystic fibrosis patients in the new unit at St. Vincent's hospital were to be reduced to 20.  This statement was issued by the Department after the "Prime Time" programme on Wednesday evening.  I heard the Minister's response to Deputy McGrath, which was that late last Friday the Taoiseach, and possibly the Minister, met with Professor Charlie Gallagher and the CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and Mr. Philip Watt along with hospital and HSE officials.  There was clarification on the issue, namely, that there would be a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 34 bed units, that two bed units would be available at all times to CF patients in the hospital and that these units, whether in rooms or wards, would be infection free.The Minister must agree the whole saga has knocked the confidence of cystic fibrosis sufferers, their families and friends.  Before the election, the Minister and the Taoiseach were around the CF issue like a rash.  Only the week before last the Taoiseach received a very warm welcome at the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, CFAI, conference because of the commitments the Fine Gael Party had given towards a 34-bed unit at the new St. Vincent's unit.  Since Wednesday I have spoken to people affected by this issue.  They want more than a verbal clarification on the issue.  In my experience, a verbal commitment is not worth the paper on which it is not written.  Today I wish to have the Minister's commitment that a written statement will be drawn up with the agreement of the hospital, the HSE and the consultant, Professor Gallagher, with protocols put in place in respect of bed management and the two beds that are to be left infection free for CF patients.  I also want clarification by 17 May of the commitment to 34 beds for CF patients.  People believe this must be the case.  We want a committed, unequivocal commitment from the Minister's Government, stating this will happen.  That date is three weeks away and this allows time for the groups to meet.I have spoken to people from the Cystic Fibrosis Association in the past 24 hours who want this, and they want it in writing.  That is the only outcome that will calm them and revive the confidence of CF sufferers in this country who deserve to have these facilities copperfastened and in place.  That should not be a problem for the Minister who had made a commitment before the election to these patients, as he now has.  I know the matter can be dealt with and I wish to have the commitment today, in this Chamber, that there will be a written statement putting in place all protocols for this matter to be dealt with in the hospital and in order that we will not have to argue the toss when people arrive in accident and emergency departments in the future.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I thank the Deputy opposite for allowing me the opportunity to bring absolute clarity to this very important issue.  I shall correct some of the statements made.  Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's well-known interest in this area, he was not involved during the events of last week.  It became apparent after the "Prime Time" programme that there was considerable lack of clarity and much concern for many people in respect of the number of beds available for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients in the new unit.  In order to address that we arranged to bring people together so that they could communicate.  Let me be absolutely clear — there was communication between all interested parties and this was arranged by me and my Department in order to clarify the issue.  Arising from that, a statement has been published on both the CFAI and the HSE websites, signed off by all parties.  Therefore, there is no confusion.The building of the new ward block at St.Vincent's hospital is a priority for me, as Minister for Health, for the Government and for the HSE.  My commitment to cystic fibrosis is no less now than it was when I first stood in this Chamber as a new Deputy on the first Adjournment debate for which I called on the issue.  The development of the new 100 bed unit being built at St. Vincent's hospital encompasses both inpatient and day care facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  It represents a major improvement in the care of CF patients in Ireland.  It is essential that all inpatients are cared for in single en suite rooms, by multidisciplinary teams with special training in cystic fibrosis.The new unit will have 100 inpatient beds and ten day care beds and is due to be completed next year.  Progress is being expedited as we speak.  The new building, which I reiterate has single en suite rooms and isolation rooms, will play a vital role in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and a range of other ailments.It is Department of Health policy that there must be sufficient inpatient beds to treat all people with cystic fibrosis who require hospitalisation.  Last  week I arranged communication between the various stakeholders to ensure there was a common understanding about the precise arrangements related to cystic fibrosis patients in the new unit.  It is important to emphasise the position was agreed with all the stakeholders.  The number of cystic fibrosis inpatients at St Vincent's hospital and the resultant requirement for beds is expected to vary between 20 and 34.  In this respect 20 inpatient beds is a minimum number not a maximum, and the number of beds with appropriately trained staff that can potentially accommodate 34 patients will be provided.The Deputy must agree, as do people within CFAI and others, that if there is a situation where there are 22 patients in the hospital with cystic fibrosis and 12 beds in isolation rooms lying idle we could not in conscience tolerate a situation where a young, immunocompromised, terminally ill man on chemotherapy or a similarly immunocompromised mother in her 30s would be left on a trolley in the accident and emergency department.  I do not believe any Member of this House would accept that nor do I believe anybody in CFAI was looking for it.  What they want is an assurance that when somebody with cystic fibrosis is ill, he or she can have a bed in an isolation room with an en suite facility and be attended to by staff who are trained specifically in the care of cystic fibrosis.  That has been confirmed.It is important to note there is a much greater understanding now and that Professor Charles Gallagher, who is the leading light in cystic fibrosis treatment in this country and serves on the medical board of the CFAI, Mr. Philip Watt, on behalf of the CFAI, Mr. Nicky Jermyn, the chief executive of the hospital and Dr. Barry White, a clinical director of the HSE all got together via telephone to discuss this.  They agreed an absolute and clear understanding, clear to the point where two of the parties were perfectly happy to post the same statement, signed by all four parties, on their respective websites.I am very pleased to have the opportunity to clarify any misunderstanding and confusion, lack of clarity and communication.  I remain totally committed to this very important project which will, in my view, improve services to patients with cystic fibrosis attending the hospital.  It is my belief also this unit will go a very long way towards improving the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis so that they will match the international norms of which we are aware, and we will no longer have to preside over the terrible situation where citizens of this country have a life expectancy that is ten years less than that of their cousins in Northern Ireland.

I ask the Minister to intervene and personally review the recently announced decision of the HSE to close an operating theatre and surgical ward at Croom hospital.I shall give some initial background.  Croom hospital operates without a waiting list.  Its policy is to treat patients on the basis of clinical need at the time of presenting.  The Minister will be well aware that over the years the hospital has produced fantastic results in terms of its service as a centre of excellence to the people of the mid-western region.  At the moment there is a suggestion that up to 30 specialist orthopaedic staff would be transferred from the Mid-Western Orthopaedic Regional Hospital, Croom to the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital, Limerick and the general hospital.  There is fear and concern among the staff that what is being suggested as a temporary arrangement between August and December could become a more prolonged issue, especially considering that up to eight weeks was taken out of Croom last year.Croom is a centre of excellence.  I realise there are budgetary constraints within the HSE but Croom is not part of this in the sense that it has the capability to deal with all national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, hip procedures for the country were it required by the HSE.  It also has the capability to take on two extra operating theatres if the HSE so desired and this is preferable to closing down one of them, albeit as a temporary arrangement.  We are concerned about it and the staff are concerned.  Ultimately, those concerned are those who could potentially wind up on waiting lists in an unnecessary fashion given that Croom does not have a history of waiting lists.  I petition the Minister on a personal basis to intervene in this matter, to review the situation and to call on the HSE to address it.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I welcome the debate and I thank Deputy O'Donovan for raising the issue.  The closure of two theatres and one ward will impact seriously on the orthopaedic health service, further delay necessary elective surgery and will seriously impact on the quality of the service to patients.  I understand consultations are taking place between hospital consultants and the management of the HSE.  I understand the consultants have put forward proposals to introduce savings that will not include the closure of the theatres.  It is important that the management are encouraged in every possible way to enter the discussions in a positive fashion and that the proposals, which I believe can overcome the proposed closures, should be taken into account.  Once the people at the coalface are involved, the solutions often impact less on the patients.  Hopefully, this will be successful.Croom is a highly efficient hospital and enjoys a high degree of admiration for its quality of care in the mid-west.  Its staff have a high level of commitment to service and care for the patients treated there.  My immediate family has had experience of that treatment and care in Croom hospital.  People have the highest regard for the services there.  Hopefully, the Minister will encourage in every way the discussions taking place at the moment such that they will be successful.  I support Deputy O'Donovan's call for any intervention by the Minister to ensure that the closure does not take place.  That much is necessary for the region.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I thank Deputy Patrick O'Donovan for raising this important matter which, I realise, is of particular concern to him and his constituency colleague, Deputy Dan Neville.  The Government's key priority in dealing with serious budget pressures on the health services is to minimise the effect on services for patients to the greatest degree possible.The Mid-Western Regional Orthopaedic Hospital, Croom provides elective orthopaedic services for the mid-west area.  The hospital currently has 50 inpatient beds and nine day beds.  I acknowledge that in excess of 1,700 inpatients were treated at the hospital last year and almost 3,000 day-case procedures were carried out.  This is a hospital we value and it provides good care.  Croom hospital currently performs well on waiting time targets for elective surgery and the HSE's intention is to continue to meet the waiting time threshold for access to elective surgery for public patients.  I will ensure that waiting time performance in Croom, and in all other hospitals, will be monitored intensively throughout the year and bed capacity adjusted accordingly to address any change in performance.In common with all agencies, the HSE is facing significant financial pressures.  This increases the importance of delivering more within a given level of resources.  In this regard, the mid-west hospital group has a requirement to operate within budget and must manage resources accordingly.  A budget break-even plan is in place to ensure the group remains within its approved expenditure levels.  This plan is based on achieving the overall activity targets set out in the annual service plan and the right balance between emergency and elective activity within the resources available for this year.  However, I am not prepared to accept a situation where services are cut back suddenly to meet a spending target, however important it is to keep within budget.  Recently, I made it clear that there should be no withdrawal or curtailment of services by the HSE without my first being briefed.  In each case I am keen to satisfy myself that any change in provision of service is both appropriate and justifiable.  My first priority is to protect services for patients.  Accordingly, I have instructed the HSE to give me a comprehensive briefing on all aspects of the issue in Croom hospital before it makes any change to the agreed level of service.The HSE has assured me that the measures proposed will not affect emergency or orthopaedic trauma activity and will enable savings to be made in staff overtime, agency and non-pay costs for the remainder of the year amounting to €2 million.  It has also indicated that 37 inpatient beds and nine day beds will continue to be available for elective surgery under the proposal.  However, there will be no changes until I have been fully briefed about the proposals and their implications for patients.I assure the House that I envisage Croom orthopaedic hospital as a vital part of the health services infrastructure of the mid-west.  I am committed to ensuring acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular, I am keen to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller local hospitals, nearer to patients' homes, communities and friends.  The recovery from operative procedures is influenced by having the support of one's family and friends near to hand.  This is the context in which any proposals on spending and services in Croom orthopaedic hospital will be examined.In short, there will not be any changes until we have reviewed the implications for patients, waiting lists and for the budget.  The Deputies may rest assured that they will have an opportunity to return and make further representations when further deliberation is carried out and a result obtained.

The CSDP, which is an integral part of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake civilian and military missions outside the EU for peace-keeping, conflict prevention, and the strengthening of international security in accordance of the principles of the United Nations Charter.The CSDP is entirely consistent with Ireland's values and interests, including the primacy of the United Nations.  As a small EU member State with a great deal of experience in peacekeeping and conflict resolution, and an impressive development assistance programme, Ireland has a valuable part to play in international crisis management and the CSDP offers us an additional important forum in which to play such a role.Ireland played an active role in the development and implementation of the CSDP.  For instance, we were a significant contributor to the successful EU operation in Chad and Central African Republic.  The CSDP also has a strong civilian dimension: 16 out of the 24 EU missions so far have been civilian in character.  Ireland currently participates in six EU civilian missions and two of the EU's three military missions.  Ireland has played a full part in the evolution of the CSDP to date and we will have an equally close involvement in its future developments.

Responsibility for publishing annual reports under the Control of Exports Act 2008 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation.  I understand that a report of activities under the Control of Exports Act 2008, for the period 2008 to 2009, has been prepared. The Minister will shortly consider the material with a view to its early publication.  The role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in this area is to provide foreign policy advice on applications for export licences at the request of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. My Department also attends meetings of the EU Working Party on Conventional Arms Exports, where EU Member States exchange information and coordinate export licensing policies and practices.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The importance of promoting the rights of citizens is clearly highlighted in the Government's Statement of Common Purpose, which gives an undertaking to ensure that every one of our citizens has an effective right, free from discrimination, to contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of the nation. Our goal is that Ireland will be recognised as a modern, fair, socially inclusive and equal society. This is a commitment that has a horizontal impact on how we conduct our business, both domestically and in the international sphere, including at European Union level.The Lisbon Treaty brought about a significant advance in the Union's treatment of fundamental rights, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming a legally binding document with the same legal value as the Treaties. Since the entry into force of the Treaty, Ireland has worked with its fellow Member States to ensure that the Council plays its role in the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Furthermore, Ireland was and continues to be strongly supportive of EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, a step which is explicitly provided for the Lisbon Treaty. All EU Member States are already party to the Convention and the Court of Justice of the European Union already has regard to the provisions of the Convention and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in identifying EU fundamental rights.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.The report of the UN Fact Finding Mission into the Gaza conflict, or the Goldstone Report, was published in September 2009 and was widely welcomed as a serious and authoritative investigation of events during that conflict, and an attempt to bring greater accountability for this conflict. The Report has again been the subject of public debate in recent weeks following the publication of an article by Judge Goldstone.  In my view this article has been significantly misrepresented. It cannot reasonably be interpreted as amounting to a refutation of the report of the Fact Finding Mission. I do not believe that Judge Goldstone's comments in the article materially undermine the findings of that report. The report continues to impress as a sober, painstaking and sincere investigation of events which were complex and violent, and in relation to which it was, and remains, very difficult to achieve clarity.In the year and a half since its publication, the Israeli military has conducted a large number of inquiries into alleged incidents. A number of these inquiries appear to suggest that some of the incidents were the result of error rather than deliberate misuse of force. However, the Goldstone Report did not find that Israel deliberately targeted civilians as a matter of policy. Accordingly, claims that this has now been overturned are wrong and misleading. Furthermore, while the Israeli investigations are welcome, they do not constitute the full and open accounting which the Report called for. In particular, they deal with wrongdoing or errors by individual soldiers, and do not address wider issues such as the direction of the campaign and terms of engagement used.It is important to note that the Fact Finding Mission led by Judge Goldstone was also clear from the beginning about the bias inherent in the Human Rights Council's original mandate. The Mission found, moreover, that missiles fired at Israeli civilian targets by Hamas and other militants in Gaza clearly constituted a war crime. It is also no surprise that no investigations at all have been carried out by Hamas.The Human Rights Council, taking into account what the parties have done thus far in terms of domestic investigations and accountability, followed up on these issues in its Resolution of 25 March. In discussions on this Resolution within the EU group in Geneva, Ireland (which is not a member of the HRC) argued for a generally positive view of the text, although there are elements of it which are problematic for some partners.  The UN General Assembly will now consider how to take this matter forward. In 2010 Ireland voted in favour of the General Assembly Resolution on this issue. We continue to regard the Fact Finding Mission Report as a serious and unimpugned document which merits serious follow-up. Our approach to any draft resolution which is proposed at the General Assembly will however depend, as before, on the terms of the resolution and our assessment of the sincerity of those who put it forward.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	312	In 2011, Ireland's total contribution to Official Development Assistance (ODA) will amount to €669 million. It is estimated that €534 million of this funding will be administered by Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs, which manages the Government's aid programme. Some €135 million is accounted for by contributions of other Government Departments and by Ireland's share of the EU development cooperation budget. On current projections, this level of allocation will ensure that Ireland will provide approximately 0.52 % of GNP for development assistance.As I have stated in my reply to the earlier Priority Question, the Government is strongly committed to Ireland's aid programme. We are very proud of the programme and its achievements and we value the broad cross-party and public support on which it is based. Development remains central to Ireland's foreign policy. In our programme for Government we have clearly stated that we are committed to the 0.7% GNP target, and will seek to achieve it by 2015.  Given the current economic circumstances facing the country, the target will be difficult to achieve. Our strategy is to restore growth to the economy, and to provide the basis for sustained growth in the Government's aid programme.As I have stated already, the Government was elected to rebuild our society and our economy, but not to do so at the expense of people who are significantly less fortunate than ourselves, many of whom have to provide for their families on incomes of less than $1 a day.  Decisions on the annual allocations for the aid programme will of course have to be taken in the context of the overall budgetary situation. However, I can give the assurance, as Minister with responsibility for trade and development, that I will make the strongest possible case for funding for development assistance.Ireland's aid programme has a strong international reputation for its focus on clear results in the fight against poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  I want to ensure that Ireland can meet its international commitments, and that Irish people can remain proud of their contribution to the building of a fairer society, not just at home but also in the poorest countries and communities.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The Government supports the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara.  Ireland has not taken a position on the future status of the territory, so long as that status is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.  At present, the Western Sahara is a non-self governing territory. Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self governing territory may only be exploited for the benefit of the people of the territory, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.  The Government's view is that any exploration and exploitation activities that proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara would be in violation of the principles of international law applicable to natural resource activities in non-self governing territories.The Government would expect that any Irish company operating abroad would have due regard to the principles of international law and the rights of the inhabitants of the territory. I am aware that San Leon Energy is engaged in exploration activities in Morocco and Western Sahara. These projects have not yet advanced to exploitation stage. I would expect any Irish company operating in the Western Sahara to ensure that any economic benefit derived from its activities benefited all the people concerned and was in accordance with the principles of international law.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 as the framework for international development policy up to 2015. They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty. The Goals are central to Ireland's overseas development programme, and to the Government's development policy.Last September, the MDG Review Summit at the UN in New York assessed progress against each of the Goals and set out the measures which will be necessary if they are to be achieved by 2015.  It is clear that there has been significant progress in some areas since 2000.  There have been remarkable improvements in primary school enrolment, access to clean water, child health and the treatment of HIV and AIDS. However, progress has been slow in other areas, for instance in reducing maternal mortality.  The Summit agreed that international assistance needs to be directed more effectively at regions where progress has been slowest, notably sub-Saharan Africa, which is the main focus of Ireland's aid programme.Despite the advances, the actual numbers of people living in poverty and hunger continue to increase.  The first of the MDGs aims to halve the proportion of people suffering from poverty and hunger. Hunger is one of the key determinants of poverty and exclusion, and reducing hunger is a key pillar of Ireland's development policy.  I know that the focus on hunger, and especially on agriculture and on mother and child nutrition, is supported in Ireland across the political spectrum.  We are building our cooperation with the US Administration, with our EU partners and with developing countries to ensure that it receives the concerted international attention required.In my role as Minister of State for development I plan to visit a number of our Programme Countries in the coming months to see the impact of our aid programme, to assess how we can strengthen our work on hunger and to underline the Government's commitment to the achievement of the MDGs.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	315	One of the most important international meetings on development issues this year will be the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, to be held in Busan, in the Republic of Korea, in November.  The Forum will represent a milestone in the international effort to judge the quality of development assistance and its contribution to social and economic progress in developing countries.The Government's aid programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, has a strong international reputation for its focus on poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa.  The OECD Development Assistance Committee has described the aid programme as cutting edge, and a champion in making aid more effective.  Ireland has played a strong role, in cooperation with other international donors and with developing countries, in the concerted international effort over the past decade to ensure that development aid is delivered to maximum effect, and contributes to sustainable change in the lives of people and communities in poor countries.  Ireland is fully engaged, both nationally and through the EU, in the preparations for the Busan meeting.The High Level Forum will assess progress on the role and contribution of aid in international development.  Considerable work is being undertaken internationally to prepare and present evidence on the extent to which Official Development Assistance, together with developing countries' own resources, is leading to sustainable improvements in the lives of poor people.  The Forum will bring together Government representatives from the developing and the developed world, parliamentarians, civil society and others with an interest in strengthening the impact of aid.  It will be an important opportunity to discuss the framework for development in the run-up to the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals, and beyond.Ireland's aid programme has always had strong cross-party support, not least because of the demonstrable effect it is having in our Programme Countries.  I look forward to visiting several of the Programme Countries over the coming months.  It is essential that we be in a position to show clearly, both to the people of developing countries where we work and to the Irish people, the impact of our assistance.  For instance, in Mozambique the number of people living on less than a dollar a day is continuing to decline and income per capita has doubled in the last 10 years. In Tanzania, the Government now reports a primary school enrolment rate of 95.9 per cent. In Lesotho, the percentage of people living with HIV who are accessing anti-retroviral drugs has increased from 25 per cent in 2007 to 44 per cent in 2009.  Improvements such as these have only been possible through cooperation at Government, local and community level, ensuring that all resources for development are used coherently and effectively, and are focused on achieving long term improvements in the lives of poor people.I want to ensure that Ireland's experience and evidence from our aid programme are brought to bear in Busan.  In the preparations for the High Level Forum, Ireland is engaging with our partners in developing countries, and with the OECD, the EU and the UN.  I believe it is important to consult also with the elected representatives of the Irish people and with the Irish organisations involved in development.  I will ensure that arrangements for these consultations are put in place in the coming period, and I look forward to further discussions with Deputies in advance of November's meeting.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	316	As the Deputy will be aware, the political and military situation in Cote d'Ivoire, which had been creating increasing violence and instability in that country since the elections on 28 November 2010, came to a head ten days ago.  Former President Laurent Gbagbo, who had refused to accept the UN-certified elections result, was captured on 11 April and is now being held in a secure location pending a trial.At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 April, EU Foreign Ministers welcomed the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo and the declaration of President Alassane Ouattara that he intends to pursue a policy of reconciliation and reconstruction in Cote d'Ivoire.  The European Union pledged its full support for such a policy to help restore social and political stability, and stands ready, for example, to support the work of the proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  EU Foreign Ministers also encouraged President Ouattara to form an inclusive, broad-based government representative of all the regions and all strands of political opinion in the country.It is also clear however, that those from either side of the conflict who are responsible for human rights violations must be held accountable for their acts.  I would hope that the International Commission of Inquiry into alleged human rights violations, which the UN Human Rights Council set up on 25 March 2011, will investigate these allegations as swiftly and thoroughly as possible.The EU on 11 April also affirmed its willingness to support the rapid economic reconstruction of the country.  Sanctions directed against government economic bodies have been lifted, so that trading through the ports and with government entities can be resumed with immediate effect.  The EU intends to resume its development assistance programme as soon as possible, and will examine the possibility of delivering some quick-disbursing assistance to meet immediate needs.  These include the short-term humanitarian requirements, where the EU will work closely with the UN and other international agencies to alleviate the suffering of those displaced by the conflict or in need of essential supplies where they live. Ireland has contributed to UN agencies to help meet the humanitarian needs of the population, particularly those of displaced persons.Throughout the crisis Ireland and its EU partners have recognised the leadership demonstrated in particular by the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the African Union in seeking a resolution to the conflict.  The United Nations has also played a particularly important part, and the EU has also recognised the essential and continuing role of UNOCI, in protecting the civilian population in Cote d'Ivoire in line with its mandate and UN Security Resolution 1975.  It is important not merely for Cote d'Ivoire but for the whole region that, with the restoration of accountable government, the country can re-establish its stability and foster reconciliation, so that shattered lives can be re-built, families re-united, and normal life resumed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I am deeply concerned at the substantial deterioration in the human rights situation in Iran, from what was an already very poor level, since the disputed Presidential election in June 2009. I am particularly disturbed by the continuing high rate of executions in Iran. It is appalling that the Iranian government uses death sentences and executions as political tools to create a climate of fear and hence discourage dissent.It is clear that there has been a pronounced increase in the rate of executions during the first months of this year, possibly deliberately intended to discourage opposition protests on Iran's National Day on 11 February. EU High Representative Ashton, in a statement issued on 27 January which I fully support, expressed deep concerns on the part of the EU at the alarming rate of increase in executions. She called upon the Iranian authorities to halt all pending executions and to declare a moratorium on the death penalty as soon as possible.Within such an abysmal human rights environment, there are some individual cases that particularly epitomise the injustices which are being perpetrated. The sentencing in January 2011 of the Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh to 11 years in prison, as well as an effective lifetime ban in Ms Sotoudeh's practice of her profession and her confinement to Iran, is one such case. I fully support High Representative Ashton's statement on 14 January expressing the utmost concern at this sentence. Last week, it transpired that Mrs Sotoudeh had withdrawn her appeal as she had been told that such an appeal would be futile. She has also, to date, been denied proper access to medical assistance. These are further violations of her inalienable rights under both Iranian and international law. I call on the Iranian authorities to release Mrs Sotoudeh without delay.The case of Ms. Sakineh Ashtiani, sentenced to death by stoning for adultery last year, has justifiably attracted widespread international condemnation and attention. Senior officials in my Department have directly raised her case on a number of occasions with the Iranian Ambassador and appealed for this sentence to be overturned.  High Representative Ashton has again clearly articulated the EU's serious concerns on this case, including in a statement made on 2 November 2010.My Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials have already held a number of meetings with the Ambassador since the start of this year to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. We also continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran. At its most recent meeting, which I attended, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted restrictive measures, comprising a travel ban and asset freeze, against a number of serious human rights offenders in Iran.  I welcome this step as a demonstration of the depth of our concern.Further measures have also been agreed in order to allow the EU respond in a more timely fashion to serious violations of human rights in Iran while also trying to keep some basic channels of communication open with the Iranian authorities. Ireland was also active in ensuring the successful adoption at the recently concluded session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva of a decision providing for appointment of a Special Rapporteur to examine Iran's human rights situation.  We will continue to call in the clearest terms for an improvement in the human rights situation in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	318	As the Deputy will be aware, a key focus for my Department in the coming months will be on rebuilding Ireland's international reputation and leading on the international aspects of our economic recovery.  The Department, through the Embassy network, has an important contribution to make in this regard, working closely with other Departments and the State Agencies.The United Nations remains at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy. Our committed and active membership is testament to our belief in the importance of effective multilateralism, respect for international law and the defence of human rights. The universality of the UN affords it a unique legitimacy and authority, which provides an invaluable framework for common reflection and decision-making.  The role and context provided by the UN is of paramount importance in maintaining international peace and security and in framing strategies to address global challenges, such as climate change, global poverty, and the threat posed by nuclear weapons.  Ireland is a strong supporter and an active participant in the work of the United Nations, and I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to participate fully in all aspects of the work of the Organisation. For my own part, I intend to travel to New York in September to participate in the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly.I can further assure the Deputy that the Government's commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in Irish foreign policy is as strong as ever.  As a sign of this commitment, since taking office I have reaffirmed Ireland's intention to seek membership of the UN Human Rights Council for the period 2012-2015 at elections scheduled to take place in May 2012.  Ireland will be competing against some formidable opponents for a seat on the Council but we are determined to run a strong campaign, with the aim of being at the heart of the UN's principal forum on human rights issues.Ireland is also a committed member of the Council of Europe, and, as a founder member, has consistently supported the Organisation in its work to promote the values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law on our continent.  The impact of the European Convention on Human Rights and the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights on the protection of fundamental rights serve as evidence of the importance of the Council's work.  Ireland also supports and is fully engaged in the discussions on the reform of the European Court of Human Rights.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26 and 31 together.Contacts with fellow member States of the European Union are part of the ongoing work of my Department. These are conducted in Brussels, by our embassies in the capitals of the EU countries and in interaction with the relevant embassies in Dublin. These contacts cover the whole range of EU agenda items; naturally, over the past couple of years economic diplomacy has been given particular prominence.I intend that that should continue to be the case and the diplomatic initiative which I announced a couple of weeks ago has a particular focus on explaining the steps we are taking in the economic and financial area, the context for them, and winning the understanding and support of our partners. This includes the area of debt sustainability to which the Deputy refers. The initiative will make full use of the channels available, through our own embassies in the EU and through those accredited in Dublin. I met the Ambassadors of EU member states accredited to Ireland on Monday 18 April, giving them a thorough briefing on our position which was followed by a useful dialogue.  There will also be a conference of Irish Heads of Mission at Headquarters on 1 and 2 June to ensure that our entire Mission network is briefed on the Government's approach and the points to get across to the authorities, as well as to media and economic actors, that they are dealing with.I see these initiatives as pursuing the broader aim, set out in the Programme for Government, of restoring Ireland's standing as a respected and influential member of European Union. We want to build up a pattern of consistent engagement, of advancing our interests in the EU, certainly, but going beyond that as well to making constructive contributions on the wide range of the EU agenda.  This means ensuring active and consistent participation by Irish Ministers in meetings of the Council, and making the most of the opportunity thus provided for bilateral meetings on areas of interest with Ministerial opposite numbers and representatives of the EU institutions.  For example, I held discussions with my colleagues from Luxembourg and Finland at last week's Foreign Affairs Council, and my colleague Minister of State Creighton had bilateral meetings with her Greek and Bulgarian colleagues at last week's General Affairs Council.  Visits to a number of member States are also in planning, and these will be carried out in a coordinated way between colleagues and myself.I should mention that one area of particular interest as we build up contacts will be plans for and expectations around the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2013.  Overall, we want to get a message to our European partners that our economic recovery is important not just for Ireland but also for the EU as a whole. We will also make clear that Ireland is determined to play a constructive role in the European Union, in keeping with our responsibilities as a member and our commitment to the values on which the Union was built.

Over the years, this policy and the value it encompasses have helped to define Ireland's place in the world and our approach to international relations.  Successive Governments have not seen the tradition of military neutrality as meaning that we stand aside from international engagement.  Rather, they have considered that it strengthens our ability to make an effective contribution to the promotion of global peace, security and development, whether through the UN, the EU or our own bilateral actions.Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 24.

A detailed response to these allegations was sent to the Working Group in a letter of 15 January 2010 on behalf of the Government.  This represented the Government's substantive response to the issues raised by the latter.  The Government's response made clear, inter alia, that no evidence has ever emerged that any person has ever been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.

Ireland, in common with our partners in the European Union, is of the view that the US economic embargo on Cuba seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects the welfare of the Cuban people.  On 26 October 2010, Ireland and our EU partners once again voted at the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution calling for an end to the US embargo.

I will bear overall responsibility for the executive action of the OSCE next year and the co-ordination of its activities.  Officials in my Department have been actively engaged since the autumn in preparations for our Chairmanship. As part of these preparations, Ireland is participating this year in the OSCE Troika with the current chair of the organisation, Lithuania, and previous chair, Kazakhstan. Weekly Troika meetings take place at OSCE headquarters in Vienna.I expect to address the organisation's Permanent Council later this year to provide an outline of Ireland's Chairmanship priorities.  I  refer you to my recent reply to your written question, number 6848/11, which provides full details on the ongoing preparations for our Chairmanship.  Ireland was one of the founding States of the OSCE and we have always recognised the organisation's vital role in maintaining peace and security in the Eurasian region. I am honoured to chair the OSCE in 2012 and greatly look forward to the challenges and opportunities of this position.

This process represents an inherent injustice and humiliation for Palestinians. The existence of the settlements also necessitates a network of checkpoints and movement restrictions which are an oppressive daily reality for Palestinians.    More broadly, the settlements also constitute, and are intended to constitute, an obstacle to the achievement of a comprehensive peace. If the settlements had not been put in place, I believe the way to a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and the Arab world would now be clear and readily achievable.In February Ireland co-sponsored a draft resolution in the UN Security Council to restate key principles about the settlements. While, for various reasons, this was vetoed by the United States, the support of all the rest of the Security Council sent a clear signal about the widespread international agreement on this issue.  I am firmly of the view that a re-instatement of the settlement construction freeze which ended last September would be a major confidence building measure that could enable direct negotiations to resume.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Climate change has been described by the UN Secretary General as the greatest humanitarian challenge facing the world today.  It is clear that the communities which are being most severely affected by climate change are those in the world's poorest countries.  The impact of climate change is contributing to a growing incidence of humanitarian disasters, and to increased poverty, food insecurity, hunger and disease.At the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December 2009, Ireland affirmed that it would meet its international climate commitments and play a full role in agreeing a new comprehensive global climate agreement.  Ireland signed up to the Copenhagen Accord, under which developed countries committed to provide a total of US$10 billion annually over the three years 2010 to 2012, building towards a total annual contribution of US$100 billion by 2020, for climate actions in developing countries.Recognising that climate change presents particular challenges for developing countries, the European Union committed at Copenhagen to making a significant contribution of  €7.2 billion in fast start financing for developing countries in the period 2010-2012.  The then Taoiseach pledged at the European Council prior to the Copenhagen Summit that Ireland would provide up to €100 million in the period 2010-2012 as its share of this EU commitment.  Ireland's contribution is being provided under the Votes of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has the lead role on the international climate change negotiations, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which manages the Government's aid programme.  Through the Department of the Environment, €23 million was provided in 2010 for climate actions in developing countries.  The funding was channelled through the EU Global Climate Change Alliance, with a particular focus on the impact of climate change in a number of the priority countries in Africa for Ireland's bilateral aid programme.The Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, has a strong climate change focus to its work in a number of countries. It is estimated that in 2010, over €10 million was provided under the programme for work focused on the effects of climate change.  This includes support to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a group of institutions working to help farmers in developing countries to adapt to the challenges presented by climate change.  In Malawi, for instance, Ireland's support focuses on increasing smallholder productivity, using drought resistant crops and sustainable agriculture techniques, and working with communities to devise programmes which can help them cope better with climatic and economic shocks.It is important that developed countries act in line with the commitments which they have made internationally and continue to play their part in assisting developing countries to cope with the impact of climate change.  As Minister with responsibility for Ireland's overseas development programme, I will ensure that we continue to strengthen our response, in particular for the least developed countries, which are least able to cope.  Through the aid programme, we will build our support for programmes and projects that have a strong impact on the interlinked areas of development and climate change adaptation.

This is in addition to those states — mostly in Africa or in the Islamic world — who have recognised Palestine for many years.Over thirty years ago, Ireland, in a speech by my predecessor of the day, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first EU Member State to declare that the resolution of the Palestinian issue must involve the establishment of a Palestinian state. That is now the policy of the EU and of the international community. I share the commitment of successive Irish Governments to this policy and will be working towards its realisation.   It would be premature to declare such recognition now, in advance of actual control of the territory in question, a condition to which we in Ireland attach significance.  It is also important to recall that the Palestinian leadership, while clearly working towards the declaration of a State in the near future, have not yet done so. The timing of such a declaration will be an important decision for them to take, and may involve potential negative consequences on the ground.Separately, a number of EU partners, including Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and the UK have recently taken steps to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Delegations in their countries, largely in recognition of the continuing progress being made by Prime Minister Fayyad and the Palestinian Authority in building up the institutions of a future Palestinian state.  By a decision of the previous Government in January — which I fully endorse — the Palestinian representative office in Ireland was upgraded to Mission status, headed by an Ambassador.  I very much hope to be able to extend Irish recognition of an actual, functioning Palestinian state during my time in office.

As set out in the programme for government, we want to move forward with the completion of the review of North South Implementation bodies, to identify new areas for co-operation and to accelerate the process of recovery and creation of jobs on the island.The Taoiseach underlined the importance the Government attaches to the strongest possible North South cooperation when he met with the First and deputy First Minister last month.  Preparations for the next plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council scheduled for June are currently underway.  My Department has convened a meeting of North South coordinators across Government to advance preparations for this and I hope to have an opportunity to review progress with the First and deputy First Minister once the new Executive is in place.Direct responsibility for the North South bodies established under the British Irish Agreement is exercised by five government departments: the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs (Waterways Ireland and the North/South Language Body which comprises Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency), the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (InterTrade  Ireland), the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (the Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission — Loughs Agency); the Department of Finance (the Special EU Programmes Body);  and the Department of Health and Children (the Food Safety Promotion Board).  In addition, Tourism Ireland is the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport.In addition to the important role that the North South bodies play, there are other areas of co-operation, both within and outside the remit of the North South Ministerial Council, which provide great benefit to North and South.  We look forward to working closely with the new Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly to take this agenda forward to the benefit of all the people of this island.

I believe that the scheme will provide a practical demonstration of the inclusive approach adopted by successive Governments to our Diaspora.  The Certificate of Irish Heritage will give official recognition to the many people worldwide who are conscious of their Irish heritage and feel a strong affinity for Ireland.  It will not, however, confer any citizenship or other legal rights or entitlements to the successful applicants.  Those applying for Certificates of Irish Heritage will be required to submit comprehensive details of their Irish ancestral connections and relevant documents and certificates to show their connection with Ireland.It is expected that contract negotiations with the company selected to operate the service on behalf of my Department will be completed shortly and an announcement will be made thereafter.  While there may be scope, in due course, for some Government Departments and State Agencies to develop products and services aimed at Certificate holders, our primary focus at present is to establish the Certificate scheme itself.  The Certificate is just one of a number of initiatives being undertaken by the Government to build further practical links between Ireland and the global Irish.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The decision to re-introduce fees for citizens aged 65 or over was taken by the previous Government.  The measure, which was announced in the Budget last December, took effect from 11 April 2011, which was the date set out in Statutory Instrument 47/2011 signed by the then Taoiseach and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on 3 February 2011.  Based on an estimated figure of 30,000 applications from those aged 65 or over during 2011, the cost of exempting those aged 65 and over from passport fees was estimated to be €2.4 million in 2011 in terms of lost revenue.  This figure is based on a figure of 45,000 persons aged 65 and over having applied for passports in the full year in 2010.Were the Passport Office to charge a reduced fee for those aged 65 and over or for any other category of adult applicants, this would increase further the gap between the revenue generated through passport fees and the cost of producing passports.  Any shortfall would have to be met by the taxpayer.  Given the impact on revenue of any decision to waive or reduce fees for passport applicants aged 65 and over, I have no plans to introduce any such measures at this time.I would emphasise that the annualised fee for a standard Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.  At €8 per year the Irish passport fee compares with approximately €9 per year for a British passport, €9 per year for a French passport, €8 per year for a Danish passport, €10 per year for a United States passport and €15 per year for an Australian passport.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 provides that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State save on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Order specifies that foreign military aircraft includes "naval, military and air force aircraft, and every aircraft commanded by a person in naval, military or air force service detailed for the purpose".  There are no current plans to expand the definition of aircraft contained in the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952.In the event that permission is sought, my Department requires an undertaking from the relevant embassy that the aircraft in question will be unarmed; will not be carrying arms, ammunition or explosives; will not engage in intelligence gathering; and is not participating in military exercises or operations.  These conditions are not legal requirements but are policy stipulations which are applied at my direction.  Other data sought include the type and registration number of the aircraft, its call sign, the purpose of the flight, the nature of any cargo, its destination and point of departure, and estimated times of arrival and departure.The regulation of civil aviation is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department of Transport is Ireland's primary interlocutor with the International Civil Aviation Authority, which has responsibility for the regulation of international civil aviation under the Chicago Convention.  Ireland remains totally opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition.  This position has been reiterated on numerous occasions, both domestically and internationally.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Rapid Response Corps was established in 2007 to provide a body of skilled and experienced volunteers for deployment at short notice to work with Irish Aid's humanitarian partner organisations in emergency situations overseas.  One of the important lessons learned from the international response to the devastation of the 2004 Tsunami was that the mass deployment of volunteers, while well-intentioned, can often hamper relief efforts.  Ireland's Rapid Response Corps was therefore designed to provide highly-specialised skills as rapidly as possible, as and when requested by the agencies leading the relief effort.  This model is regarded as best practice internationally in responding to humanitarian crises.At present, there are 155 people on the Rapid Response Corps roster, with specialised skills in logistics, engineering, telecommunications, humanitarian coordination and protection.  Individual members of the Corps are deployed at the request of the UN and other humanitarian organisations which have identified a need for their specific skills.Since 2007, there have been more than 122 deployments of the Corps to 33 countries.  Members of the Corps are currently working in Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Iraq, Nepal, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda.  Membership of the Corps is open to members of the public.  The Department of Foreign Affairs generally holds at least one recruitment campaign each year.  The 2011 recruitment programme began in March and is expected to add 40 new members to the roster, bringing to 195 the total number of volunteers available to deploy to humanitarian crises.  New recruits will participate in induction training in May, which will include a course on personal security awareness, facilitated by the Defence Forces' UN Training School in the Curragh.

As I stated in my reply to the Priority Question on Gaza, the slight relaxation of the terms of the blockade in the last year has been completely insufficient.  Along with our EU Partners, we are continuing to press for a full opening up of the border crossings into Gaza to allow unimpeded flows of humanitarian aid, and normal commercial and human traffic.  I recognise the essentially humanitarian motivations which gave rise to last year's Gaza flotilla, and also to the further flotilla now being planned.  We will continue to press Israel to do all possible to facilitate those wishing to transport humanitarian goods to Gaza, and in particular to avoid any repetition of the unacceptable use of force against last year's flotilla.However, my Department's essential travel advice remains that people should not attempt to sail to Gaza at the present time and certainly should not attempt to break through a naval blockade of the kind which Israel has imposed on Gaza.  I am deeply concerned that there is real potential for a similar disastrous outcome this year.  You will understand that I cannot support a project which would involve Irish citizens engaging in actions which could lead them into real danger.

The levels of trade between Ireland and Cuba are low at present.  However, in the course of the meetings to which I have referred, the possibility of developing links in particular areas such as tourism, science and technology was discussed.  In the context of the significant resources being allocated by the Cuban Government to the development of new tourist facilities, the possibility of Irish private sector involvement was discussed with the Cuban side.  There is already some cooperation between the Cuban side and researchers in the third level sector here, particularly on biotechnology given the strengths both countries have in this field.Cuba was not identified as a priority market by the relevant State Agencies during the preparation of the current Trade Strategy to 2015 and I would not anticipate that this situation will change in the medium term.  However, I can assure the Deputy that any additional potential for trade with Cuba which emerges will be considered by the new Export Trade Council to be established under the Programme for National Recovery.  My Department and our Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Cuba, will also continue to support the development of links in various sectors where possible and assist on a case by case basis those Irish companies which have an interest in the Cuban market.  I might add that our Ambassador was in Havana last month to promote a cultural week organised with the support of my Department.  He also discussed our bilateral relationship with the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs during his visit.

Providing assistance to Irish business is a key part of the work of our Embassy network, in close co-operation with the relevant State Agencies.  Embassies can support Irish companies in a number of ways, including by advising on local business practice and opportunities; making introductions and providing networking opportunities; hosting business events; and providing local market information. The Embassy network also supports, where possible, Irish companies who are experiencing commercial difficulties.  However, in relation to legal issues companies are advised to seek appropriate professional guidance.I am also aware that individual Irish citizens have experienced difficulties in relation to their purchases of property in Portugal and I can confirm that the Embassy in Lisbon has had contact with a number of citizens in this regard.  However, the Embassy is not in a position to provide legal assistance and it has advised these citizens that they should consider seeking independent advice.  To assist citizens, the Embassy can provide a list of English-speaking lawyers, and also the details of the national body in Portugal which handles complaints in relation to the legal profession.  The role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to private financial and legal transactions by Irish nationals abroad is limited and Embassies generally are not in a position to offer legal advice.

The Department's travel advice for Bahrain strongly advises Irish citizens to register their details with the Irish Embassy in Riyadh, which is accredited to Bahrain.  Registration is voluntary and citizens can register by completing a travel registration form on the Department's website www.dfa.ie.  The information submitted is passed to the Irish Embassy in Riyadh.The Honorary Consul in Bahrain also passes the details of Irish citizens of whom he is aware to the Embassy in Riyadh.  The Irish Embassy in Riyadh is in regular contact with Irish citizens in Bahrain and on 22-23 February 2011, a Consular Officer from Embassy Riyadh visited Bahrain to meet with members of the Irish Society of Bahrain, major employers of Irish citizens in Bahrain and longstanding members of the Irish community there.  In the course of these meetings, arrangements were made to circulate widely, through various channels, a citizen registration form which could be completed and emailed or faxed directly to the Irish Embassy in Riyadh.The Embassy subsequently issued a number of advisory notices to citizens in Bahrain, providing them with updates on the security situation.  In all such notices, the Embassy encouraged citizens to register.  I strongly encourage citizens travelling or living overseas, including in Bahrain, to register with the Department.  Registration enables the Department to contact citizens more quickly in the event of an emergency and allows us to make provision for citizens resident abroad in our contingency planning.

As part of this change, a number of reliefs and exemptions were abolished to broaden the tax base and to commence the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the Memorandum of Understanding with the ECB, EU and IMF to introduce a Site Valuation Tax.   Section 64 of Finance Act 2011 removes the exemption on a conveyance of property by or to a housing authority or the Affordable Homes Partnership.  Accordingly, documents effecting such transfers now have to be presented to Revenue for stamping.  However, the Stamp Duty payable is limited to a maximum amount of €100.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	340	A clear distinction needs to be made between householders who are in a position to meet their mortgage repayments and those who are not, or who are most vulnerable to entering into arrears on their mortgage repayments.  The ESRI in its report in 2009 on Negative Equity in the Irish Housing Market has noted at the outset that: "In many cases negative equity will not be an issue. Many of those in negative equity will be unaffected and will continue to pay their mortgage without difficulty."  (ESRI Report 319, pp 2).  Indeed the ESRI, through its trawl of the international literature, did not conclude that there is a direct relationship between negative equity and mortgage default rates. [In its concluding commentary, the ESRI noted that "negative equity does not cause default or foreclosure but rather is a condition of default"  (ESRI Report 319, pp 17).]However, I am acutely aware that there are many householders who require immediate assistance and in this regard there are numerous measures in place to alleviate the problems faced. It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.The Central Bank's Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears applies to mortgage lending activities with consumers, in respect of their principal private residence in the State, and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.  The Code sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. For the purposes of the Code a "pre-arrears" case arises when the borrower contacts the lender stating that he/she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about going into mortgage arrears. Under the Code, lenders must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process known as "MARP" and use this framework when dealing with consumers who are in arrears and pre-arrears situations. Also under the Code where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the Courts to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower's primary residence.The Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt made a recommendation in their final report dated 16 November 2010 that lenders should put in place a deferred interest scheme (DIS) or a variation of it. Under the DIS borrowers who can pay at least 66 per cent of their mortgage interest (but less than 100 per cent) can, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, defer payment of the balance for up to five years. Lenders representing the majority of the market have already notified the Central Bank of their intention to introduce a DIS as recommended by the Expert Group. While the DIS is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the Scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.  The Deputy will also be aware of the existing importance of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in assisting consumers who have fallen into arrears

I am advised by Revenue that following failure by the business concerned to arrange payment of the debt or engage meaningfully with Revenue toward payment, the debt was referred to the Revenue Sheriff for collection. I am also advised by Revenue that they have received no request for a meeting from the company to discuss matters.  Revenue further informs me that in this case the sheriff has been in regular contact with both the business concerned and its agent.

If the business concerned wishes to avoid possible seizure of assets by the sheriff then it is essential that it engage directly with the sheriff meaningfully and urgently.

Service to Killybegs-based traders is available from the Revenue office in Donegal Town, which is only 25 kilometres from Killybegs.  A pool of staff is available at Donegal Town to ensure continuity and consistency of service and to deliver a broad range of customer services from that location.   All traders concerned have full contact details for relevant Revenue staff, including contact names, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail addresses.  Where necessary, an officer from Donegal Town attends at Killybegs by appointment if physical presence is needed for any particular transaction.The level of service provided, as well as the methods of service delivery, is kept under review.  The Revenue Anti-Evasion Teams cover Killybegs Port as part of their ongoing patrols, while the Customs Cutter patrols the coastline.  The attendance of these enforcement personnel is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Patrols of the ports are kept under constant review to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.

When this proposal has been thoroughly examined and analysed and the findings and recommendations are presented to me, I will decide on the appropriate action to be taken.  However, it is unlikely that any measures will be introduced before budget 2012.As regards changes to personal bankruptcy law, the legislative programme for the Department of Justice and Equality includes a Personal Insolvency Bill that will provide for a new framework for settlement and enforcement of debt and for personal insolvency.  The Bill will take into account the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement of December 2010.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, is in the course of being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to publication as soon as possible this year. It will also contain some interim measures in relation to reform of the law on bankruptcy.As regards assisting struggling homeowners, the Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group produced two Reports, an Interim Report published in July 2010 and a Final Report published in November 2010.  All of the Expert Group's recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Final Report.  They can be accessed at www.finance.gov.ie.Since the publication of the Reports, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the recommendations of the Expert Group, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:Borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) are  not charged penalty interest charges;Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications is outlawed;Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP; andWhen a lender is determining the 12 month period it must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, it must exclude  any time period during which a borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals Board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman under the CCMA.The revised CCMA was published on 6 December 2010 and came into effect on 1 January 2011.  The revised CCMA can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie.  Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace ending on 30 June 2011 to put in place the requisite systems and training of staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.  In addition, the Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the MARP.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Expert Group’s proposals for a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) or a variation of it.The Deputy will also be aware of the existing importance of the Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) Scheme and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) in assisting consumers who have fallen into arrears or who are experiencing difficulties servicing their mortgage repayments.

It is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting measures this year to ensure that the numbers of teachers employed in schools is consistent with the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland.  This requires that all permanent and fixed term positions are in the first instance made available to those surplus teachers with either permanent contracts or contracts of indefinite duration.The purpose of these changes is to ensure all surplus teachers are absorbed into vacancies that exist in other schools.  Flexible redeployment arrangements are required in order to ensure all surplus permanent teachers are redeployed into vacancies.  The country simply cannot afford to have surplus teachers in a school while permitting recruitment to take place in another school.  The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of frontline services is protected as much as possible in our education system.As permanent teachers on the panels are fully paid and have pension entitlements, they are a part of the existing public sector workforce, which is covered by the Croke Park Agreement.  It is the intention of the Department to restore recruitment from fixed-term teachers on the main panels, supplementary panels or public advertisement at the earliest possible opportunity, after all the surplus permanent teachers have been redeployed.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.In respect of the allocation of Resource Teaching hours, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) is required to ensure that the overall allocation of teaching posts does not exceed the targets set out in the Governments Employment Control Framework.  The DES had planned for a certain amount of increased growth in teacher numbers across the school sector in 2011, in line with increased demographic growth.  In respect of resource teaching hours for children with special educational needs, allowance was made for growth in 2011 over and above normal demographic increase levels.  In 2010, the total number of Whole time Equivalent (WTE) posts provided for resource hours teaching (including under the General Allocation Model) was approximately 9,600 WTE posts.  By comparison approximately 9,950 WTE posts are provided for 2011.My Department requested the NCSE to provide data on the numbers and rate of application for additional resource teaching hours to date this year so that this information can be considered in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations.  The NCSE has also been asked to pause sanctioning additional resource teaching support hours to allow for collection and consideration of this data by the DES, in conjunction with the NCSE.  It should be noted that this is a temporary suspension of the allocation process in order to allow for consideration and analysis of this issue prior to any decisions being made.The NCSE issued a Circular to schools advising them that the final date for schools to submit any outstanding, completed, applications for resource teaching supports is 13th May 2011.  On receipt of all outstanding applications the DES and NCSE will be in a position to consider resource allocation for the coming school year, in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations. Schools will be notified of their allocations as soon as possible.  In the interim, children who are eligible for resource/ learning support teaching can receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that it is envisaged that the building project at Scoil Chonaill should be completed in the third quarter of 2011.  With regard to water charges for schools, the Deputy will be aware that under the Water Framework Directive, the payment of water charges is required with effect from 1 January 2010.  The legal advice available to the Government is that schools, like other non-domestic water services users, must pay the full cost of water services used on a metered basis.My Department does not provide additional funding to schools to cover energy costs and water charges, which are expected to be paid through funds received from the capitation grant.  Primary schools currently receive €337 per pupil in combined capitation and ancillary funding, which can be assigned according to the priorities of the Board of Management.  I am sure you are aware that my Department, as is the case for all Government Departments, has had to identify efficiencies in all areas of its budget.  It is not possible, therefore, to provide additional funding to schools for heating or water charges.  I do not propose to provide a specific contingency fund to take account of the costs identified by the Deputy.

The rationale for this circular was to maximise the opportunities for the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers.  The process of allocating teaching resources to schools for 2011/2012 and the arrangements for filling vacant or new teaching posts, including temporary posts, takes place in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland and the Public Service Agreement 2010/2014.

This  review is part of the normal review processes undertaken by Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure.  I have no predetermined view on the outcome of the review.  Educational quality for the pupils must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size and organisation, taking into account both the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  The review should be completed by the end of this year and I plan to consider the review's conclusions when it is finalised.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	361	As the Deputy will be aware, currently under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Schemes the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  Where undergraduate students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the free fees schemes, it is the higher education institution concerned that determines, in accordance with its own criteria, the appropriate tuition fee payable by such students.With effect from the 2011/2012 academic year, a new student contribution charge of €2,000 will be introduced in higher education.  This charge will replace the existing Student Services Charge and will apply to all students who currently benefit under the ‘free fees' scheme.  The contribution will be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes.The Programme for Government provides a commitment to undertake a full review of third level funding with a view to introducing a funding system that will provide third level institutions with reliable funding but does not impact on access for students.  This review will be advanced as part of the wider implementation plan for the higher education strategy and links to recommendations made in the Hunt report in relation to the role of the HEA in advising on the sustainability of the system, developing the higher education funding model and supporting institutions in widening their funding base.  I will be considering the issues involved including an increased contribution by students as referred to by the Deputy as part of my wider consideration of the implementation plan.

The application was considered and the school was advised that it was not possible to grant aid the application.  A letter to this effect has issued to the school.The capital budget allocated to my Department has been reduced this year and unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding it is not possible to grant aid all applications.  My Department must ensure that allocations within the overall capital spend are made on the basis of overall needs, particularly having regard to the demographic demands that are in place.It is open to the school to re-submit the application in future years and it will be considered in the context of the funding available under my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in the light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project at the school at this time.I wish to advise the Deputy that the school received funding in the amount of €497,500 in 2007 to construct two classrooms, undertake conversion works, upgrade the heating system, provide tarmac play area, install alarm and CCTV systems together with other incidental works.  The school also received funding of €24,000 under the 2005 Summer Works Scheme to upgrade the electrical system.

Under Circular 0021/2011, issued by my Department in March this year, the minimum required standard of education for appointment to the post of SNA has been amended.  People appointed to SNA posts from 1 September 2011 will be required to have: a FETAC level 3 major qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications, or a minimum of three grade Ds in the Junior Certificate or the equivalent.  The above are the minimum qualifications required for appointment as a SNA.  The actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The Deputy will be aware of my Department's commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs in school settings.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child's ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.  SENOs with their local knowledge and expertise are a valuable resource to parents in sourcing an educational placement.The Deputy will also be aware that my Department provides grant aid under the Home Tuition Scheme to provide early education intervention for pre-school children with a confirmed diagnosis of autism or to parents of children with autism who are awaiting an educational placement.

The issue of how these extra pupil places will be provided is currently under consideration in my Department.A project with a brief for a small extension and refurbishment of existing accommodation at the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.  The Design Team is currently working on its stage 2(a) submission and my Department has recently requested an indication of when that submission might be received.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	367	A major programme of reform in Mathematics is under way in all second level schools since September last, building on the experience of 24 schools which began the programme in 2008.  Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system. A key objective is to improve attainment levels in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.  The programme is supported by a comprehensive investment in professional development for teachers which will run to at least 2013.Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis over a three year period across 5 strands of mathematics as follows:—Phase 1: Strand 1 — Statistics and Probability + Strand 2 — Geometry and TrigonometryPhase 2: Strand 1+2+ Strand 3 — Number + Strand 4 — AlgebraPhase 3: Strand 1+2+3+4+ Strand 5 — Functions Strands 1 and 2 began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at Leaving Certificate and 2013 at Junior Certificate. Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011, and strand 5 will start in 2012.As each phase is implemented in the 24 Project schools, the syllabus for that strand is being finalised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the light of their experiences, before being issued to the mainstream schools.  As a result of the process of monitoring the experience in the 24 Project schools, some syllabus adjustments were made in Strands 1 and 2 on foot of feedback raising concerns as to the need for more time to promote active learning approaches particularly for those students following Project Maths in the Leaving Certificate who would not have experienced the new approaches at junior cycle first.  A decision was made that elements of inferential statistics would be deferred and elements of synthetic geometry would be optional in the Leaving Certificate syllabus for a temporary period (up to 2014 in all mainstream schools) until students had first followed Project Maths methodologies and approaches at junior cycle.  These adjustments were made before the syllabuses issued to all schools in August 2010.  The syllabuses for Strands 1-4 will issue in August 2011 and Strand 1-5 in August 2012. This will be the final syllabus.A national programme of professional development for all teachers began in 2009, and will continue to at least 2013. Some €5m was spent on this area in this area in 2010 and an estimated €3m in 2009. This investment will be continued in 2011 and funds have also been provided for the development of a post graduate programme for teachers who need additional support.Project Maths has been widely welcomed by the partners in education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the National Competitiveness Council, Engineers Ireland, the Task Force on Innovation, and by higher education and industry interests. Improving understanding of and attainment in mathematics is a critical part of the strategy to promote Ireland as a smart economy.

However it is important to emphasise that the proposal will be considered in the context of my Department's policy in this regard.My Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.Reflective of the important role of continuing professional development my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.The Deputy will be familiar with the ABA pilot scheme which was funded by my Department for the past decade. All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  These schools will operate in line with my Department's policy.  I am pleased to update the Deputy that following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  Eight schools have opened and the remaining five are scheduled to open shortly.  It is my intention to continue to support this transitional process.The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available.  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.

This extra care must be likely to be required for at least 12 months.The eligibility criteria for DCA are broadly the same as when the scheme was administered by the Health Service Executive.  The main change to the scheme since it transferred to the Department is that it is now a statutory scheme while prior to the transfer the eligibility criteria was set out by way of a yearly circular from the Department of Health and Children.The refusal rate when the scheme was administered by the HSE is reported to have been approximately 20%, but as it was administered separately by each HSE area, consistency could not be guaranteed and the refusal rate varied considerably from area to area.The percentage of applications for children suffering from autism related conditions that are allowed is significantly higher than the average.  The most recent statistics available indicate that of over 500 claim processed for children with autism related conditions, 62% were allowed compared with under 40% of claims overall.

The decline in the estimate over these two years is caused by projected increases in average incomes having the effect of raising pay for some employments to levels which attract the higher rate of employer's PRSI.

The five factors are:(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;(c) the nature and pattern of the person’s employment;(d) the person’s main centre of interest, and(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.I am satisfied that the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.  The Irish practice in relation to habitual residence is in line with the relevant EU Regulations.  There are no plans to introduce any other changes to the habitual residence condition at this time. Its operation has been and continues to be monitored constantly by my Department.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection.  The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by FÁS in a single delivery unit. This unit will also have responsibility for payment of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection. The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and/or seek advice about their training options.  The focus will be very much on the individual, his/her rights to a payment, his/her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his/her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided. This should improve a person's life chances.Responsibility for skills training undertaken by FÁS currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills. The legislation enacted in December 2010 which transferred the Employment and Community Services functions to the Department of Social Protection did not refer to the Training Services of FÁS. The future development of the training and skills services of FÁS is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, I am determined that this will be completed in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end. While this will be a multi-annual programme of work requiring the development of the new service, the assignment of functions to the Service and the development of its organisational processes and operational systems, many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming 12 months.The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year.  The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year.  This will enable us to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.Planning for the transfer and integration of the employment and community employment services of FÁS to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year.   Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.   A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.   These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their roll out nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.

The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 883/04 and 987/09. The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.The Regulations set out the rules as to which State's social security system a person will pay contributions to when they move from one Member State to another to take up work, or where they live in one State and work in another. In addition, the legislation also sets out the rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. unemployment, sickness, old-age etc.The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which he/she is employed. With few exceptions, the State of last employment is responsible for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed. The Regulations also provide that when entitlement to benefit is being examined insurance contributions made in any other Member State must, if necessary, be aggregated with contributions made in Ireland.In general, a Belgian national who has worked in Belgium and meets the qualifying conditions for unemployment benefit there, who then wishes to move to Ireland to seek   work, may export and continue to receive that benefit from Belgium for up to six months in accordance with EU legislation. In order to qualify under these provisions the person must be signing-on in his/her home State for up to 4 weeks and make application for an export of benefit in advance of any move to another country. It is understood that the person in question has already moved to Ireland so this option may not be available to them.  A decision in that regard would be a matter for the Belgian social security services.A person would not be entitled to Irish social security benefits, such as Jobseeker's Benefit, until they become subject to the Irish social security system by entering insurable employment here and paying PRSI contributions. In the event of any subsequent period of unemployment they may become entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit on the basis of their Irish contributions, and any reckonable contributions made under the social insurance system of any other EU Member State.Those who do not qualify for social insurance payments here can apply to have their eligibility for Jobseeker's Allowance assessed.  In order to qualify a person must satisfy a means-test and be considered to be habitually resident here.

The circular letter to which the question refers reiterated existing procedures in relation to the taxing of these vehicles.  It did not state that such procedures would only apply on the purchase of a new vehicle.To be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for that purpose and must be used solely in the course of trade or business.  Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner that would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used in a private capacity it must, like all other private vehicles, be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.Licensing authorities have an obligation under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992 to be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate document that would indicate that the applicant is in trade or business.  An income tax registration number is now routinely sought as part of the RF111A Goods Only Declaration form.It is up to the individual concerned to provide whatever evidence is required by the licensing authority in order for it to be satisfied that the applicant is entitled to claim what is in effect a concessionary rate of motor tax.  I intend to review the taxation classes currently in place for motor vehicles.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Meeting the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive is a key national priority in respect of waste management and I am committed to implementing the measures necessary to ensure that Ireland meets the associated landfill diversion targets.  Data from the National Waste Report 2009, published recently by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), show that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) disposed of to landfill decreased by 11% in 2009 to approximately 1.06 million tonnes. On the basis of this data, the EPA have now indicated that Ireland is "on track" to meet the first (July 2010) Landfill Directive target when this is reported on in due course.There are, however, much stricter BMW diversion targets to be achieved in 2013 and 2016.  In order to position us to meet these challenging requirements, my Department will be completing a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on draft Household Food Waste Regulations; the purpose of such Regulations would be to divert BMW material away from landfill primarily through the more widespread roll out of a brown bin system.  I expect to conclude this RIA and to announce my decision in relation to these Regulations before the end of the next Dáil session.Insofar as the position in County Meath is concerned, the National Waste Report 2009 confirms that while there is a privately operated brown bin collection service operating in the County, it is currently only available to 1.5% of the households serviced.  In its role as lead waste authority in the North East region, Meath County Council is currently reviewing waste collection permits in the region, in consultation with neighbouring regions, with a view to facilitating roll out of brown bin collection services from January 2012 in population centres exceeding 1,000 persons.There is no financial support available from the Exchequer in relation to the provision of brown bin collection services.  I am confident, however, that the measures outlined, together with recently announced increases in the Landfill Levy to be phased in between September 2011 and July 2013, will act as important catalysts for the further expansion of such services and underpin the continued progress required in the years ahead to achieve compliance with the Landfill Directive targets for 2013 and 2016.

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the relevant terms and conditions, are the responsibility of the local authority.  An outline proposal by Respond Housing Association for the development of 21 units of accommodation for elderly persons on Aranmore Island under the Capital Assistance Scheme was submitted to my Department by Donegal County Council in February 2004. However, no subsequent application for funding in respect of the construction stage of this project has been received from the Council.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Under the terms of the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, which is administered by the local authorities, grants are available to assist households to have necessary repairs or improvement works carried out in order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes.  Three separate schemes are available.Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability:  This grant assists people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. Eligible works include the provision of access ramps, stair lifts, accessible toilet and shower facilities, wheelchair access and extensions. The effective maximum grant under the scheme is €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the approved cost of works for applicants, including those in full-time employment, who have gross household incomes of up to €30,000 per annum, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.Mobility Aids Grant Scheme: This scheme is available to fast track grants of up to €6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. Qualifying works include the provision of stair lifts, level access showers, access ramps, grab rails and some minor adaptation works to the fabric of the house such as adaptation of downstairs room/closet to provide sanitary facilities etc. The effective maximum grant available is €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works subject to a maximum annual household income threshold of €30,000.Housing Aid for Older People Scheme: This scheme provides grants of up to €10,500 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Grant eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning, painting etc. Maximum grant available is €10,500 which may cover up to 100% of the costs of works for applicants with gross annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.  The regulations governing this particular grant scheme do not specify an age qualification. In general local authorities are advised to restrict the payment of this grant to older people, i.e. those aged 60 and over. However, where in the opinion of the local authority, genuine cases of hardship exist, the authority may consider the payment of a grant to individuals who are less than 60 years of age.The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my Department, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. Grants of up to €6,350 are also available from my Department for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of houses.  Outside of these grant schemes, there is no specific grant scheme currently available from my Department for carrying out refurbishment or repairs to old houses.The Home Energy Saving scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI), provides grants to homeowners for improving the energy efficiency of their homes in order to reduce energy use and costs. This scheme, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is open to all owners of existing homes built before 2006

However, there are a number of applications still on-hand. Completion of sales has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking the conveyancing work involved.  In general, priority under the scheme is being given to applications pertaining to those 32 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation where turf cutting has already ended.

However, there are a number of applications still on-hand. Completion of sales has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking the conveyancing work involved.The Government recently announced a number of decisions regarding the future management of peatlands in Ireland and, in particular, the protection of bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas. In addition to the establishment of an independent Peatlands Council, the Government has announced a compensation package for turf-cutters in sites where continued turf cutting is no longer possible for reasons of environmental protection. My Department will be writing to land owners and turf cutters in affected areas outlining details of the compensation scheme and how to apply.  Provision has been made to meet the costs involved.  My Department will also be writing to all remaining applicants under the voluntary purchase scheme in the coming weeks to outline their options in light of the availability of alternative compensation arrangements.

The application is being considered at present.Approved housing bodies may apply, through the local authorities, for funding under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme to acquire or construct accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing needs, including older persons and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.  It is a matter for individual local authorities to determine the eligibility of proposals for funding approval, having regard to the merit of such proposals and the extent to which they meet local housing need, etc.Approved housing bodies may also purchase properties or enter into long-term lease arrangements with property owners with the objective of making such properties available for social renting in accordance with the terms of my Department's social housing leasing initiative.  In the case of approved long-term leasing proposals, approved housing bodies are paid an agreed sum, by way of an availability payment, to meet the cost incurred in acquiring the property and in managing and maintaining the property.My Department regularly meets with potential investors who wish to become involved in the social housing market. These meetings are largely focussed on providing information on the social housing leasing initiative and related issues and do not involve an endorsement of any individual or organisation. So far, my Department has not approved any leasing proposal involving the organisation in question.

I am aware that the trade gives rise to concerns reported in communities about crime that may be linked to the cash for gold trade.  The informal purchase of jewellery is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation; however the circumstances under which jewellery is being bought and/or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, for example handling stolen property and/or possession of stolen property under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.My Department is currently finalising a report on the Cash for Gold trade and, in this context, has been in close contact with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána with a view to monitoring the position.  I can inform the Deputy that the Commissioner has recently reported that all Cash for Gold premises in the State have been visited by an Garda Síochána and the operators have been made aware of their responsibilities and obligations with regard to purchasing gold and jewellery.  In addition, contact information provided to operators will facilitate the reporting to the Garda Síochána of any suspicious activity.  The Commissioner has also indicated that any new premises that may be identified will be visited by an Garda Síochána.  Let me assure the Deputy that as soon as the report I have referred to is finalised and submitted to me, I will make an assessment as to what if any further action, legislative or otherwise may be required.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made in respect of him.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on his behalf. On 21st July, 2005 a Deportation Order was signed in respect of him. This Order was served on the person concerned, by registered post, which placed a legal obligation on him to ‘present' at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday, 4th August, 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He ‘presented' as required and was given further presentation dates which he kept.By letter dated 23rd July, 2008, the legal representatives of the person concerned applied for the revocation of his Deportation Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of this application, a decision was made to affirm the Deportation Order. Notice of the affirmation of the Deportation Order was served on the person concerned, by registered post, which placed a legal obligation on the person concerned to ‘present' at the Offices of the GNIB on Thursday, 6th November, 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.  The person concerned failed to keep that appointment but cited medical reasons for his failure to do so. He is not currently subject to any presentation requirements with the GNIB.On 14th November, 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned again applied for the revocation of the Deportation Order.  This application, under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), is currently being considered.  Once a decision has been made on this application, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. In the mean-time, as a person subject of a Deportation Order, the person concerned is legally obliged to comply with any reporting requirements that may be placed on him by the GNIB.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

Internet gaming, including internet poker, is not licensed in the State, therefore none of the gaming sites mentioned by the Deputy can claim to have any authorisation from the State to provide services to jurisdictions where such gaming is prohibited.  I understand the sites in question have licences granted by other jurisdictions.  I also understand that a company which is located in this jurisdiction, having moved here in 2006, and which is linked to one of the sites mentioned by the Deputy, provides information technology, marketing and business support services to the on-line poker market.  These are not areas that come within the ambit of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-2003.I realise that our gambling laws are not capable of meeting the challenges of the internet age.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that because the previous Government declined to adopt a policy on gambling, arising from the review being undertaken from within my Department, it now falls to me to consider what are the best choices in terms of settling a revised regulatory architecture for gambling into the future.  Any legislative proposals arising from my examination and subsequent discussions at Cabinet will follow in the normal course.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The pig industry is a valuable component of the overall agri-food sector, and has a farm gate value in excess of €300 million.  The sector supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services and these are dispersed around the country.  Production, prices and exports grew significantly during 2010 and the impact of this growth was felt at all levels of the production cycle.However, I am aware of the difficulties currently being experienced by the sector.  While returns have improved in recent months and are forecast to improve in the medium term, the biggest issue for producers at the moment remains feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  This is reducing margins to below the long-term average, a situation which may have an impact on production decisions in both the short and medium term.  Difficulties in maintaining credit facilities with suppliers and banks are exacerbating this situation.The ‘ Food Harvest 2020 Report’, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  Ambitious targets have been set in relation to sow productivity, the size of the national herd, together with a 50% growth in the value of output by 2020, and I am chairing a High Level Implementation Group to ensure that the recommendations in the report are implemented.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I met with Maria Damanaki European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in Luxembourg on Thursday 14 April. I invited the Commissioner to visit Ireland to meet the fishing industry and hear at first hand their concerns and their views on the reform. I will issue a formal invitation to the Commissioner in the coming days. The Commissioner indicated her willingness to accept this invitation.The purpose of the meeting, which was convened at my request, was primarily to discuss the planned reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The ongoing development of our seafood sector and job creation in our coastal communities was central to my message. The meeting itself was cordial and I believe sets a foundation for a good working relationship with Commissioner into the future.A major priority for me in the Reform is the  retention of the Hague Preferences, agreed by Heads of State in 1976 by way of the Hague Resolution, under which Ireland receives additional shares of quotas for the whitefish stocks around our coast. There was been strong pressure from certain Member States that these should be abolished in the Reform. I made it very clear that any interference that results in Ireland losing the current benefits of the Hague Preferences within the reformed CFP would be totally unacceptable to me. The Hague Preferences were the payment made for Ireland granting access to our waters to other Member States and a recognition of the high costs involved for the State in the control of these rich fishing grounds and they must be maintained in the new CFP.I set out Ireland's opposition to the mandatory privatisation of fish quotas which the Commissioner advised would form a key element of the Commission's proposals  for  reform.  I outlined the impacts of this policy on Ireland's coastal communities dependant on fisheries. I used the opportunity to explain why Ireland is strongly opposing a mandatory scheme for privatisation and trading of fish quota. I explained that the family owned fishing fleet in Ireland would be quickly bought out by international fishing companies without links to the coastal communities. I explained my strong belief that these companies would not land into Ireland and we would lose not just the jobs in the fleet but also the processing and ancillary jobs in our fishing ports.Commissioner Damanaki has placed discarding of fish high on her agenda for the CFP reform. I made clear that I am committed to giving Ireland's support to assisting the Commissioner in identifying and implementing the appropriate measures to effectively address discards.In addition to the issues surrounding the CFP reform, I made very clear Ireland's demand for strong actions against Iceland and the Faroe Islands for their irresponsible and untenable fishing activities on the mackerel stock. The actions of these two fishing nations pose a serious threat to the well being of the mackerel stock which is very important to Ireland. I pressed the Commissioner to initiate strong action now, including the introduction of trade sanctions to bring pressure to bear on these two parties to come to the table with reasonable demands and agree a long term management framework for mackerel.I will continue to liaise closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen and other industry representatives to further develop Ireland's negotiating position. I consider that this meeting with Commissioner Damanaki was very useful in giving her a full understanding of Ireland's situation and the importance of the maintenance of a strong fishing industry supporting the fishing communities around our coast.With regard to timelines, the Commissioner advised that she plans to publish the draft regulatory proposals before the summer break. The planned adoption time is  the  end of  2012.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Proposals for the introduction of mandatory privatisation of fish quotas, or Individual Transferable Quota's (ITQs), as part of a reformed Common Fisheries Policy pose, I strongly believe, a substantial threat to the future of Ireland's fisheries and broader seafood sector.  In the context of determining Ireland's position, the Irish fishing industry has made clear and has re-affirmed to me directly at a recent meeting, that it opposes the introduction of an ITQ system for Irish fisheries management. This does not mean that there is not scope to amend current national quota management arrangement.  I am fully open to proposals in this regard, with a view to giving industry a larger role.Ireland is a small island nation, on the periphery of Europe, with the dependencies all islands have on the broader marine related sphere, of which fisheries is an integral and essential component. My overarching goal is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations.While ITQ's may work for some Member States, they are not, I believe, suitable for the unique dynamic in the Irish fishing sector, where we have a network of small rural coastal communities dependant on our fishing fleet, large and small, demersal and pelagic. The Irish fishing fleet is for the most part made up of family owned vessels with strong links to their home ports. These families have a long tradition in fishing with generations succeeding each other into the industry.I have no doubt that if mandatory ITQs are put in place, our quotas for both whitefish and pelagic will be purchased by large European fishing conglomerates, with no socio or economic links to our ports, and landed elsewhere, with the resultant loss of jobs and economic activity around our coast. For Ireland, this scenario would, I consider, wipe out our national fishing industry and we will not get the benefit from the rich fisheries resources in the waters around our coasts.To put in perspective much of the employment on shore in the seafood sector is generated by landings to Ireland by Irish vessels of all sizes. This activity delivers approximately 5,000 jobs in our fleet, with another 2,900 employed in our processing plants with around 1,200 employed in ancillary support industries. These jobs are dependent on Irish quotas being landed into Irish ports.  Any change to this would seriously jeopardise the ongoing viability of these jobs with disastrous consequences. In any economic environment a risk of this magnitude to these opportunities cannot and will, most definitely, not be supported.  I had the opportunity to meet with Commissioner Damanaki in Luxembourg on the 14 April, and ITQs were high on the agenda. She is now in no doubt as to my level of opposition to any such proposals, and while our meeting was both fruitful and productive on a number of fronts I expect some hard negotiations ahead before this issue is resolved.I will of course continue to engage with the Federation of Irish Fishermen and other stakeholders over the coming months, to both strengthen my negotiating position but also to develop a multi pronged lobbying strategy in Europe to reinforce Ireland's stance, and garner support from other like-minded Member States.

These were submitted to Pobal for assessment in October 2010 and are currently being considered by my Department.I should add that responsibility for the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) and related matters are in the process of being transferred to my colleague, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government. It is anticipated that the transfer will take legal effect from 1 May 2011.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I have asked the HSE to develop an implementation plan for a catch-up programme for HPV vaccination of girls in secondary school to commence in the new school year this autumn.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	419	It is Department of Health policy that there must be sufficient inpatient beds to treat all people with Cystic Fibrosis who require hospitalisation.  It is essential that all inpatients are cared for by multidisciplinary teams with special training in Cystic Fibrosis in single en-suite rooms.The development of the new 100 bed unit being built at St Vincent's Hospital encompasses both inpatient and day care facilities for patients with Cystic Fibrosis. It represents a major improvement in the care of Cystic Fibrosis patients in Ireland. The development at the hospital will provide a state-of-the-art clinical building which will include up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.This 100 inpatient bed unit (in single en-suite rooms) will accommodate the needs of patients with cystic fibrosis and many other patients whose medical requirements necessitate single en suite facilities.  One ward (20 beds) in the new unit will be dedicated for use by cystic fibrosis patients.  Twenty per cent of the beds on each of the 5 wards will be isolation rooms. This represents best practice in terms of infection control. It will also provide 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.Last week I arranged communication between the various stakeholders in order to ensure that there was a common understanding about the precise arrangements related to Cystic Fibrosis patients in the new unit.  The position agreed with the stakeholders is that the number of Cystic Fibrosis inpatients at St Vincent's University Hospital is expected to vary between 20 and 34.  In this respect 20 inpatient beds is a minimum and not a maximum, and the number of beds with appropriately trained staff can potentially accommodate 34 patients.  When the beds are not required for Cystic Fibrosis patients they will be used for other patients with a clearly agreed protocol so that there will always be beds available for patients with Cystic Fibrosis who require admission.Both the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and St. Vincent's Hospital are satisfied that the arrangement now agreed will allow for the best utilisation of beds for those with Cystic Fibrosis and other conditions. The HSE provides Cystic Fibrosis services in a number of centres throughout Ireland. There are already some dedicated single en-suite Cystic Fibrosis beds in some of these designated specialist centres. The HSE intends to develop further inpatient adult single en-suite rooms as required in the relevant centres in line with the recommendations of their 2009 working group on Services for People with Cystic Fibrosis in Ireland. For example plans are in train to provide such rooms to cater for up to 12 adults with Cystic Fibrosis at Cork University Hospital.The Government is acutely aware of the challenges that people with cystic fibrosis and their families face in managing their condition and fully acknowledges the need for and support the provision of dedicated accommodation in an environment which allows appropriate isolation for improved infection control. The Government supports the continued roll-out of regional services for patients with cystic fibrosis.

I understand that the HSE replied to the Deputy on 9th February 2011, indicating that it was not possible for the Executive to provide the information which had been sought.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	421	CORU is the umbrella body responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals. It includes the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The Health and Social Care Professionals Council  was established in March 2007 and has been working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the twelve health and social care professions designated in the Act. The first registration board under the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, with arrangements now being progressed to facilitate the opening of the Social Workers Register to accept registrants of the profession.CORU will announce the opening of the Social Workers Register shortly and this will mark the start of statutory registration of this profession. CORU will also formally announce the registration fee that will be applicable to registrants of the Social Workers Register, and all subsequent registers, in advance of the opening of this first register. The fees will be set by CORU, having regard to the requirement for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to be self-funding. CORU has been provided with seed funding by my Department to-date but is expected to become self-funding by charging fees to meet all of its costs.CORU will enable health and social care professionals to practice in a regulated, controlled and safe environment and registrants will be facilitated in ensuring responsible and accountable practices whilst providing the highest level of patient care and service, and this positive development is very much to be welcomed.I have also asked that the representative unions concerned be consulted.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	423	As part of the provisions on social security coordination within the European Union, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is issued to European citizens who are travelling within the European Economic Area (i.e. the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Switzerland, for private or professional reasons or for reasons of study.  This card simplifies the procedure when receiving medical assistance during a temporary stay in one of these States.  Each State is responsible for producing and distributing the EHIC within its territory.  However, the card has the same technical characteristics in each State, which ensures its immediate recognition by healthcare providers all over Europe.EHIC's are issued for a defined period for a number of reasons.  The entitlement to the card is linked to the person's health entitlement in his/her home State and these circumstances can and do change.  Also, the relevant EU Regulations oblige each Member State to take financial responsibility for care provided to an "in-date" card holder and open ended issue cards would pose a significant financial risk.  Finally, the EHIC is an EU scheme and while the EU does not determine review periods, it obliges all Member States to have a card end date.In respect of the costs of renewing cards, the HSE informs me that they are not significant since many card holders operate the "self service" (electronic) system for renewal when their circumstances are unchanged.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	426	St Luke's Hospital, which provides radiation oncology services, was subsumed into the Health Service Executive under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 (No. 18 of 2010).   Radiation oncology services will continue at St Luke's until at least 2015, when further radiation oncology capacity will be available at Beaumont and St James's Hospitals, two of the designated cancer centres.  This decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  It is also in line with best international practice.The existing radiotherapy centre at St Luke's, plus the new centres at Beaumont and St James's Hospitals, have together become the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network with some staff and resources now transferred from St Luke's to the new centres. The first patients were seen at Beaumont on 28 March, while St James's began seeing patients on 11 April. The new centres have four linear accelerators each. While the number of linacs in St Luke's will be reduced as patient numbers transfer to the new centres, the development of the St Luke's Network means an overall increase of 50% in radiation oncology capacity over what had previously been available in St Luke's.In relation to the future use of  the St Luke's site I can confirm that the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 provides for the future use of the site as a health facility and states that the HSE may not sell or dispose of St Luke's or any land on the site, without my consent.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	427	The Health Service Executive is finalising a National Review of autism Services following a recognised need to review and clarify at national level the direction of health service provision for individuals with autism. A HSE led group has been set up to review and compare the learning from the current range of existing models of service delivery across the country, and to identify core principles of service delivery and standards of practice that will guide the national service model of the future. It is expected that the Review will lead to a greater level of standardisation in the way that services are delivered for people with autism and that it will be presented to the Health Service Executive Board in late 2011.The Review will be considered by my Department in the context of Autism Policy which must address the needs of both children and adults with Autism.  I have had informal discussions already with the Minister for Children and the Minister for Education with a view to a more coordinated approach to meet these needs.

Under the scheme the Health Service Executive may make arrangements for the supply without charge of medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.  The award of a medical card is a matter for the Health Service Executive and is based on means.  There are no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group of patients with specific medical conditions, as a whole.However, while the income guidelines are the principal benchmark used for deciding medical card eligibility, the HSE does look beyond the applicant's financial situation and have regard to other appropriate matters in assessing a person for a medical card, such as illness or medical circumstances which result in financial hardship, costs associated with medical requirements and other issues.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.  Under the Programme for Government all persons ordinarily resident will have free GP care.

Implementation of the recommendations is primarily the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Following the launch of 'A Vision for Change' in January 2006, an independent Monitoring Group was established to monitor and assess progress by the HSE, Government departments and other agencies in implementing the recommendations set out in the Report.  The Group's Annual Report for 2010 is expected to be submitted to me within the next few months.  Implementation of 'A Vision for Change'   will also be addressed by the HSE in its Corporate Plan 2011 — 2013 which is currently being prepared.

Since my appointment as Minister, I have been engaged in discussions with my officials and with the National Paediatric Hospital Board in order to brief myself on the work done on this project to date.  I want to be clear about how we can best provide the hospital in the most cost effective manner while ensuring a high quality service for our children and young people.  I intend to carry out a review of the National Children's Hospital project and will announce the details shortly. I am in the process of finalising issues around the scope of the Review.  When this is complete I will decide on the appropriate approach to the carrying out of this Review and the necessity or otherwise for a tender process.

Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant involved.  I intend to set up a Special Delivery Unit, driven by my Department, which will focus on reducing unacceptable waiting times for patients.  I am examining options for the Unit at present and will put it in place as soon as possible.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Public funding for health and personal social services to the Rehab Group is provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE). A total of €39.9 million was provided to RehabCare in 2010. My Department has asked the HSE to provide details of any other company in the Rehab Group of companies that received funding from the HSE in 2010 and I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as possible.The Government is concerned to ensure that all State funding is allocated appropriately, efficiently and effectively. While I have no direct role in relation to the salary of the CEO in the Rehab Group or their procurement arrangements, it is vital that the State receives value for money for any services funded by the taxpayer. In that context, I will be asking Rehab for a report on the CEO's remuneration package.The Comptroller and Auditor General raised concerns in the past regarding accountability in respect of funding provided to voluntary organisations in the disability sector. In response to those concerns, the HSE has worked closely with the disability sector in recent years to develop Service Level Arrangements which provide the required level of accountability for public funds. In addition, health funding provided to all disability organisations is being examined in depth by my Department in a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Disability Services. The Review is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. The carrying out of works on these roads, including the roads mentioned, is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.With regard to damage caused to a vehicle as a result of a pothole, this is again a matter for the local authority concerned. Road authorities are liable for damages only where work is negligently carried out on roads, including footpaths (i.e. misfeasance).  However, the authorities cannot be held liable for damages where injury is caused due to their failure to adequately maintain the road or to maintain it at all (i.e. non-feasance). Therefore, a road authority is exempt from civil actions where it fails to keep a public road in repair but is liable if it repairs a public road and does so negligently.

However, because of the considerable differences in licensing rules, we do not have an exchange arrangement with the USA. A person holding a US driver licence who takes up residence here must meet Irish licence requirements in exactly the same way as an Irish licence holder would need to meet US requirements if taking up residence there.As of last October, the Regulations governing the licensing of learner drivers have been amended so that a person holding a full car or motorcycle driver licence from another jurisdiction for a period of six months or more need not wait for the stipulated six months before applying for a driving test. This means that such a person can apply for a driving test immediately.

It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities in Ireland. The Programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city. The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.Over 7,400 projects providing a range of essential sports facilities have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to over €739 million. These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high quality facilities around Ireland that attract more people to participate in sporting activities.It is a common misconception that the Programme has been discontinued. While a new round of the Programme has not been advertised since 2008, the Programme is in fact very active and €33 million has been provided in the Estimates this year for the payment of grants for the provision of sports and recreation facilities by clubs and sports bodies allocated grants in previous rounds.  No decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the Programme.
