          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach will be aware from his staff, who read newspapers, watch television and listen to radio, of the horror stories that unfold every day in regard to health, horror stories involving people who are old, sick or have a disability – for instance, the 74 year old woman who spent 16 days as an in-patient on a trolley in Tallaght Hospital or the accident and emergency unit I visited recently where two suicidal psychiatric patients were under private security for two days.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Dublin hospital waiting lists are up 107% on the figure five years ago. We think the position is bad, but it gets worse every day. The latest insult is the disgraceful cutback in the number of hours available under the home help service scheme, which makes life bearable for many thousands of our citizens. In the North Eastern Health Board area alone there is a reduction of 85,000 home help hours this year. Is this not absolutely disgraceful and contemptible treatment of the vulnerable in our society who need that service? Is it right that in a country that has come through five of the strongest economic years we have ever enjoyed, people still wait four years for cataract or hip operations, seven years for orthodontic treatment and some years for cardiac treatment?</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Is this not disgraceful treatment of the health services of our country? Is it not an indication of a complete lack of leadership and of the ability to manage professionally a service that has let people down? We have heard all about task forces and reports on health. We had the Brennan report, the Prospectus report and the task force on medical staffing. Will the Taoiseach tell the House how much has been spent on these reports and on consultants' queries over recent years? Has a single initiative from any of these reports made the lives of our patients or the health delivery service to them any whit better in recent years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputies</from>
          <p eId="para_4">Hear, hear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_5">The answer to the last question is "Yes". I could cite many areas, such as the cardiac and cancer areas, where we have seen enormous improvements overall. While funding in health is up by over 160% what is more important is that hospital activity is up almost one fifth. Waiting lists are down by about 14%. The number of people on waiting lists represented 3% of all discharges for acute hospitals last year. The number of people working in the consultancy service is up 26%. There have been enormous increases in resources in many of the health areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Of course there are pressures in hospitals. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is working closely with the hospitals mentioned by the Deputy, the five Dublin hospitals, St. Vincent's, the Mater, St. James's, Beaumont and Tallaght, on both the monitoring and evaluation of the activities, services and expenditure levels. There are problems, as the Deputy stated, which have been presented in recent days. The ERHA, with the individual hospitals and the Department of Health and Children, is looking at the service levels. There are hangover difficulties from last year where the service level component in the ERHA and the individual hospitals led to an overspend, which is being reduced this year, and this is creating some difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The ERHA has advised that the same total levels of services which it agreed with these hospitals last year would be provided for the hospitals this year. The authority has also said that additional money is available this year for cancer, cardiology and renal services. At a minimum there will be protection within the system for those services at the levels that were approved for last year. Provision is being made for the completion of major initiatives which commenced last year. There are an additional 300 acute beds at St. James's, St. Vincent's, St. Michael's, St. Joseph's Raheny and Naas. The Deputy asked about the position at Tallaght Hospital. The chief executive officer of the hospital met with the staff last Thursday. He is happy to meet them to resolve the industrial dispute in that particular hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The Deputy asked about the North Eastern Health Board and the home help service. My information is that just three years ago the health board spent under €4 million on that service which represented about 10% of the budget for the elderly. This year some €8.2 million has been allocated to the home help service which represents 17% of the budget for the elderly. As can be seen from those figures there has been a dramatic increase. I do not know if I have answered all the questions the Deputy raised. He raised the issue of the Dublin hospitals, the services and reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">In his last question he asked the cost of the reports. I do not have that figure but they are all being dealt with in trying to reform the system. We are spending €9 billion on the health service and some 96,000 people are working in it. It is the belief of most of people in the health service that we should look at structural reform of that area and that is what the Minister is engaged in.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_10">This is the usual diatribe that is trotted out in response to every question. The single greatest failure of the Government in respect of health is that the bureaucracies are still as strong as ever and the services are not being delivered to the people. Last week, Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked the Minister for Health and Children to outline the budget for the 39 acute hospitals for 2003. The Minister responded by saying that level of detail was not available to him. Is there anybody in a major organisation, running major units, who does not know what is the available budget? Apparently the Minister for Health and Children is not told. How is it that the bill for taxis in the Louth-Meath area for acute hospitals for 2002 is €254,000? How is it that hours are being cut back? Is it because of the minimum wage paid to those who provide an essential home help service? The Taoiseach's response is typical of that from an accountant, it is an economic statistical response to a human problem. Give that answer to those who are lying on hospital trolleys today and to those who are lying at home in pain or in sickness waiting to be put on a list. In-patient and out-patient lists and figures are being combined and massaged. It is disgraceful that the Government is spending €9 billion of the people's money; it is like pouring it into a black hole as no effective service is being delivered. The bureaucracy is as strong as ever. Of the 24,000 employed in the health service, only 6,000 are nurses and doctors. That is an indictment and a failure of professional management and leadership of the health service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_25">Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to the statement by the former US Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, that "this is a war of choice, not a war of necessity"? Does the Taoiseach accept that public opinion regards this war as illegitimate, contrary to UN sanction, contrary to international law and driven by ideology, an ideology that threatens great instability in the region? I am sure he has seen the images of civilian casualties, which all of us have seen, the images of dismembered children and is aware of images which, according to today's "Morning Ireland" programme, are being reported from Baghdad as being too awful to be ever broadcast to the public. Against this background, does the Taoiseach still consider it appropriate to facilitate the war effort through Shannon? Does he think it is still appropriate for the Irish Government not to have a position on the new ideology or new doctrine of pre-emptive wars? Specifically, has he considered, as the leader of a neutral country, whether he ought to take some initiative with like-minded countries at the United Nations? In particular, has the Government given any consideration to invoking Resolution 377, the uniting for peace mechanism as it is known, to cause the United Nations that has been reduced to a bystander or a casualty of this conflict, to convene the General Assembly to address the grave issues we see on television every night?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_20">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_26">Deputy Rabbitte has asked a number of questions. I share his concern and the views of everybody on the reality of what we see every night on our televisions. The realities and the horrors of war, particularly modern war, high technology and sophisticated weaponry, as always in wars, hit at the innocent people who have nothing to do with it, the women who were killed in the bus, the children who were killed in the market place. Our position for many months, as Deputy Rabbitte is aware, has been that we wanted to see this conflict resolved peacefully. We wanted to see it resolved in the context of the United Nations by the enforcement of Resolution 1441 and all the preceding resolutions. Unfortunately, that was not possible. The compliance necessary to ensure that happened in an effective way was not complied with by the Iraqi Administration. They had the opportunity to do that, and it would have helped had they done so but they did not. Unfortunately, we are now into a war position.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Deputy Rabbitte knows the legal position on this war. Internationally, it is only for the UN or the international organisations to declare whether this war is legal or illegal. There has been a difference of opinion on the definition within the UN on this matter for many months. The view of the United States and others is that they have authority under earlier resolutions. The view of Ireland and other countries was that it would have been preferable as a political imperative to come back with another resolution, whether it was a legal certainty or not. The legal position has not been clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">As regard pre-emptive strikes, we do not believe the question of pre-emptive strikes applies to this conflict. The reason for that is that the permanent representatives of both the US, the UK and Australia wrote separately to the President of the Security Council informing him that military action had been taken against Iraq. All three said the reason was Iraq's failure to disarm, so they had complied with the rules. The United Nations Charter allows for the use of force in two circumstances, first, when states are acting individually or collectively or in self defence or, second, when the Security Council has decided that force is necessary. In our view a second resolution would have been the way to resolve all of these difficulties but that did not happen. Internationally and legally, it is not considered to be a pre-emptive strike.</p>

It is not the Government's intention to change its position. On humanitarian issues, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte, and initiatives we can take are being considered. The Minister will have important meetings tomorrow in Brussels, I think – the question of the venue had not been resolved early this morning when I last spoke to the Minister – to see what will happen. It was also suggested by some of the non-governmental organisations that I might speak to Kofi Annan and we are following that up. Anything we can do to assist the UN in the humanitarian effort will be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I am surprised the Taoiseach is trying to avoid the question of where we stand on the doctrine of pre-emptive war by denying it is happening. The leaders of the American Administration have made no secret of the fact that this is precisely what is happening and that this is the shape of world and geopolitics after 11 September. No one is denying the monstrous nature of this regime, but we have seen the horrific civilian casualties in this war, which we were told was about the possession of weapons of mass destruction, even though none so far has been found. We were then told the war was about regime change and then we were told it was about the liberation of people who would garland the troops with flowers as they went in. None of these things has happened. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the United States is publicising the names of those who will be sent in on behalf of the American Government to manage the reconstruction of and run Iraq post war? Is the Taoiseach saying he is not prepared to consider the use of procedure 377 to cause the General Assembly to meet and, at a minimum, try to limit the war and ensure that the reconstruction is put firmly in the charge of the United Nations? Will he answer that straight question?</p>

How can the Taoiseach justify this war, which he has done in response to the previous question? The horror for civilians is largely sanitised by the despicable and sordid coverage of the international media networks. Has the Taoiseach taken the time to view some of the Arab television stations' coverage of the war? Has he seen their pictures of distraught men and women and traumatised children wailing over the broken bodies of their relatives? Has he been briefed on the massacre yesterday in the town of Hilla of 33 innocent people by the United States bombing of a residential quarter, when cluster bombs were used? This is a picture in today's newspapers of a father in Hilla grieving over the broken bodies of his babies.</p>

I have seen much of the filmed reports, some by the Arabian media. I have also seen filmed reports of some of Saddam Hussein's operations, including the killing of women, which are horrific. In balance, the Deputy should remember some of the anniversaries of past events – for example, we saw the film of more than 5,500 people who were killed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and chemical warfare some years ago. Many children died at the hands of his regime. All war and suffering is wrong but let us not look at only one side of it. This regime has killed one million people in a decade.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_111">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 23, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The primary focus of my visit to the US was on Northern Ireland matters and this was reflected by the fact that Northern Ireland civic and political leaders were invited to the White House. Given the significance of the talks at Hillsborough and the proposals prepared by the Governments, it was important to ensure that President Bush, his Administration and our friends in Congress and the Senate are fully up-to-date on developments and are supportive of our efforts to secure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland with the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Accordingly, over the St. Patrick's Day period in Washington, I took the opportunity to fully brief President Bush, Ambassador Haass and our friends in Congress on the outcome of recent discussions. We also discussed the situation regarding Iraq, which we debated in the House the week before last.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I am extremely grateful for the continued support of the US Administration, Senate and Congress for our efforts in relation to Northern Ireland at this time and I know that we will receive strong encouragement from President Bush and our US friends to successfully and comprehensively finish the job. At this point, I cannot say when I will next meet President Bush.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">During my visit to Washington, at the invitation of president Jim Wolfensohn, I addressed the World Bank. In the course of my address, which was mainly concerned with Ireland's recent economic progress, I also referred to our overseas development aid programme and matters relevant to developing countries, including HIV-Aids and Third World debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">During my visit, I also took the opportunity to meet with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. I reported to the board on recent developments in relation to Northern Ireland and we discussed the international situation, in particular, the prospects of a recovery in the US economy. The total cost of the visit is not yet available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_116">In respect of the reply the Taoiseach gave in the Dáil last week, has the Government explained in detail and given all of the information in regard to the blueprint for the completion of the Good Friday Agreement to all of the parties in Northern Ireland? Is it his understanding that these parties have sufficient time to consider those details, to put them to their respective supporters in time for the elections to be called and to get on with their business?</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Last weekend at its Ard-Fheis in Dublin, Sinn Féin seemed to indicate through its president, Gerry Adams, that it was not yet ready to join the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Is this not a setback for the completion of the process at what is a fragile time in the run-up to this matter being completed?</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Has a date been fixed for the presentation of the final Bill by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there will be a complete response from all the parties to this, in order to allow the elections to take place, as was the intention, to let the people of the North have their decision in respect of the parties presenting themselves?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_77">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_119">In reply to Deputy Kenny's first question, as to whether everybody has all the information on the presentations, as far as I am concerned, they have. I cannot vouch that the smaller parties have all been briefed on the full detail but I think they have the overall general position. I have personally gone through it with the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin and I think that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State have also been talking to those parties and other parties as well. I believe that everybody has the position and I have been endeavouring for several weeks to make absolutely sure that there are no ambiguities or misunderstandings. People have been shown the text of the documents and brought through them. Right up until yesterday, we have been engaged in both clarifying and explaining the positions and trying to work through them. Obviously we have not been changing them because that brings one back to the whole round again. We have been trying as best we can and wherever we can to explain them satisfactorily or if there is something we feel we can change in regard to how something is presented we have gone back. I have gone back to the parties over the weekend trying to get agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The position in regard to what was said by the president of Sinn Féin at the weekend is different to what I said last week. It is a different position. As I heard it, the public presentation was not as I understood it. I am still hoping that is not the way it will end up, but if it is, it is different than I understood it. I just want to make clear what I meant. I understood that as part of this, we would move towards a completion of the policing issue in a shorter timeframe than the president of Sinn Féin outlined. I argued last week for policing in Northern Ireland to change and move on. The Bill currently going through Westminster brings us back very close to the Patten proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I know there are outstanding issues, and we have tried to address those in the current round of talks. My concern is that if the policing issue continues to be drawn out over a longer timeframe, it will create risks. In moving towards fundamental reform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the sooner we have a higher proportion of Nationalists and republicans joining the force, the better. That will boost the reform process and help to establish respect, trust and confidence in the force. The talks are not complete. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, myself, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Government are endeavouring to do the best we can. Despite his other difficulties, Prime Minister Tony Blair has devoted a considerable amount of time to this issue in recent days and has been in contact with us directly or indirectly every day for the past week. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the outstanding issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Our intention is still to present our plan within the next fortnight. The date is not fixed. My preference is for next week. The Assembly is currently suspended but must be dissolved by 28 April to allow elections to take place at the end of May. If we leave it any later than next week to present the plan, it leaves too narrow a period between that and the dissolution. I will continue to interact with the relevant parties to try to explain our positions and advance towards as full an agreement as possible. If a full agreement is arrived at, the pro-Agreement parties can go to the electorate with a very clear message based on what they have done and achieved. There have been difficulties, but the parties could also present a very good blueprint for the future. Without this, the parties will obviously still have to go to the electorate, but they will have a lot of difficulties explaining their position, and I would have difficulty doing it for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_123">Everybody in the House shares the Taoiseach's wish that a plan can be presented and implemented. However, the president of Sinn Féin has publicly announced that he has difficulty with some aspects of the details explained to him by both the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. Has the Government indicated to its officials that this confusion should be discussed with the Sinn Féin president so that all the details which have already been clearly outlined are fully understood by everybody? Can we take it from the Taoiseach that no further concessions will be granted? This matter has been raised on many occasions over the past number of years, and we are now at a point where all concessions that are going to be given have been given. Can we take it as an absolute that no further concessions will be given to any party and that the text of an agreement is practically finalised?</p>
          <p eId="para_124">On another matter, the Taoiseach took the opportunity to address the World Bank in Washington recently. He argued that the International Monetary Fund should not use poorer countries as laboratories for the development of economic theories originating in the comfort of offices in Washington. That is a laudable sentiment. I ask the Taoiseach to indicate what Ireland's overseas aid budget is this year. Is it true that it has been cut by €40 million?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_79">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_125">On policing, there are issues on which Sinn Féin, the UUP and others are still seeking clarification and explanations. That is fair enough. I will continue to hold discussions with the parties right up to the point where we present our proposals. I have no difficulty with that. I have spent an enormous amount of time doing this already and will continue to do so as will my officials. Deputy Ó Caoláin will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think there is confusion on the part of Sinn Féin. My preference is that we finalise the policing issue as part of this deal and move on within a shorter time frame. The president of Sinn Féin is not saying that he will not sign up to this in the long term but that he will not do so in the short term. That is his stated position. I cannot force people to agree to my preference. There are various other things I would like the Unionists to agree to which are not yet signed off. We will continue to try to achieve progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The suggestion contained in Deputy Kenny's question is correct. If one spends a long period of negotiating several different issues, it is better to try to tie them all down together. I have argued this with the British Government over demilitarisation, argued with the Unionists over declaring their position on devolved policing and argued with Sinn Féin on other aspects of the process. It is better to tackle the key issues. Most people in Northern Ireland see these issues as very important, but, as I see it, they are somewhat exhausted by the inability of all parties to arrive at conclusions. They criticise me, criticise Tony Blair and criticise the pro-Agreement parties for not tying down these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">If we do not achieve certainty on all the key issues, it creates difficulty. Deputy Kenny and Deputy Rabbitte have met groups from Northern Ireland and will know that as soon as one group declares an unwillingness to conclude one aspect of a deal, another party will then withdraw consent from another aspect. This creates a merry-go-round effect. I will go on with the merry-go-round, but my concern is for the people of Northern Ireland. It is far better to try to tie the issues down and achieve completion. It was not today or yesterday that we spelled out exactly what that means. Tony Blair and I spelled out the position of our respective Governments in mid-October 2002. Those positions have not changed, nor have the issues. To go into an election without that kind of certainty and clarity would have its downsides, to put it mildly. I would rather exhaust myself over the next week than have to continue with this process for the next six months. My view is that would be a mistake although others may take a different view.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Deputy Kenny also asked about overseas development aid. The Government is maintaining the percentage of national resources it devotes to overseas development aid. We are one of only five countries to do so. Even in a difficult year, we have committed, I think, 0.46% of GDP to aid, although I am open to correction on that. We are in a very good position, and that is why I had the opportunity, on behalf of the Irish people, of addressing the World Bank. I would not have had that opportunity but for the Irish people. Ireland is held in very high regard by the staff of the World Bank for the work it has done and the work that Irish NGOs, both lay and religious, carry out on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The point I made, which the Deputy picked up, was that going into African countries with economic theory on how they will resolve these issues, as set out in some of the grandiose documents at which I have looked, is nonsense. They have no opportunity and are not able to do what is requested of them. I think the Deputy knows where I stand. I have made many speeches over the years, including when I was Minister for Labour, about what should happen in developing countries, writing off debt and HIV-AIDS, and I took the opportunity to set out our position on those issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_130">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about his visit to Washington. Before he left he told us that the Government's position on the invasion of Iraq was different from that of the Bush Administration. Does he still hold that view? Did he take the opportunity to ask the President whether the attack on Iraq really is a war on terrorism? Did a discussion take place on the widely held view that this attack could spawn further terrorism? We already see suicide bombers in Iraq. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his statement that if Ireland is to withdraw facilities at Shannon, we would be the only country in the free world to do so? Did he forget about Austria and Switzerland when he made that statement or does he regard those countries as being outside the free world?</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Many people would agree with the Taoiseach's World Bank speech in which he said that developing countries should be given more opportunities to trade. Does the Government support debt cancellation for poorer countries? Does it support the evaluation of the social and environmental impact of all quota and tariff regimes regulating agricultural trade with non-EU members? On market access policies, does the Taoiseach agree with discriminating in favour of more sustainable production methods, such as fair trade products? Is that what he meant when he spoke about more opportunities to trade or did he have other ideas in mind?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_81">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_132">I will take the questions in reverse order. I am in favour of debt cancellation. When I was Minister for Finance I gave a fairly substantial amount from our budget towards the initiative in 1993. Within ECOFIN and the European Council, I have supported the initiatives since then. In regard to sustainable development, alternative agricultural production and assisting agriculture, I recently saw a presentation on the work of Trócaire. I support any other way we can assist these countries. There is an enormous amount we can do and this country has been very good in that regard through the development programmes of Teagasc, the State agency, and Trócaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">My discussions with President Bush lasted for about two and a half hours, 25 minutes of which went towards discussing issues with President Bush, Colin Powell and Richard Haass and the remainder was devoted to Northern Ireland. We discussed Iraq, North Korea, the Middle East and the HIV-AIDS initiative. That day and the following day, three or four days before the Azores meeting, diplomatic efforts were still being made to try to agree a resolution at the UN on Iraq. I, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, our ambassador and key officials, took the opportunity to outline our thinking and out position in regard to the UN, of which the President and particularly Colin Powell were very much aware. They appreciated our work, certainly until new year's eve when we were on the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I outlined to the President how we saw things, particularly the difficulties in the Middle East and what has happened there in the past two or three years. His support for the Sharon Administration, which is very much against the Palestinians, is not helpful to the overall position. I have held that view for a number of years and I had that same debate with President Clinton. The situation with this Administration is even more difficult because it has taken a position on the security of Israel, which I understand – nobody wants to see the security of the Israeli people affected. However, it is not a secret that President Bush is not a friend of Yasser Arafat. As the Deputy will know, I have had continuous contact with President Arafat. I detected that day that President Bush would move on with the new Administration which will be put in place shortly. He sees a lot of opportunities to do business and I hope that will assist the position in the Middle East. I made probably my strongest pitch on the Middle East because it is feeding into the problems in this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_135">The Taoiseach said diplomatic efforts were still under way in regard to Iraq when he met President Bush. I knew at that stage and for some time before, as I am sure did the Taoiseach, that the United States would invade. Did the Taoiseach tell President Bush that an invasion of Iraq would be illegal in his terms, a criminal venture, and should not be carried out? Will he give me a straight answer to that question? Did he tell him the views of the Irish people on an invasion and about the 100,000 plus people who marched in Dublin in opposition to his policies? Does the Taoiseach regret presenting President Bush with a bowl of shamrock, a symbol for the Irish people, in view of the atrocities for which his forces have been responsible since? I ask the Taoiseach not to lecture me on Saddam Hussein because he did not bring him shamrock on this occasion, although some of his colleagues might have brought him some in the 1980s for all we know.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Did the Taoiseach discuss with President Bush or any other responsible person, or irresponsible in view of what has happened since, the question of this country facilitating troops going through Shannon on their way to Iraq, overflights of US military aircraft or any other such details? Is it conceivable that the Taoiseach, as leader of this country, could go to the United States and not discuss those issues with senior people in the US Administration in view of what was about to unfold?</p>

          <p eId="para_137">To give the Deputy a straight answer, I outlined to President Bush the Irish views and the concerns of people here. I informed the President of the Irish view that we would like, more than anything else, a second UN resolution. I did not tell him the war was illegal but outlined the difference of opinion in terms of a second UN resolution. I told him we wanted a second resolution so he was aware of our position. I am not sorry I met the President of the United States. I respect him and his Administration. I am not apologetic for presenting the shamrock on behalf of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">President Bush acknowledged that Ireland had been of assistance by allowing landing and overflights. He understood this was creating controversy and was aware that three of the four carriers of US troops had already ceased stopping in Ireland. I did not go into any great detail on this and the President did not press me in any way to continue with our position.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">It is unfortunate that we must jumble the important international question of Iraq with the Northern Ireland situation in today's questions which are taken together. With regard to the Taoiseach's earlier reply to Deputy Kenny, did I understand correctly that, on policing, following the Sinn Féin Ard Fhéis, the Taoiseach is resigned to the fact that Sinn Féin may postpone its participation on the policing board? Is the Taoiseach saying to the House that the agreement which is, I hope, in prospect can proceed irrespective of the timing of Sinn Féin participation on the policing board? Is it correct that if, at the beginning of the life of a new Assembly, Sinn Féin has not taken up its positions on the board, it will be excluded thereafter? Can that be reviewed at a later stage to facilitate Sinn Féin involvement?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_96">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_152">The Deputy asked about a possible change in our position on Shannon. One can never say "never" on such issues but I do not foresee any change at present. I hope this war will end in the short term. If it does not, circumstances can change but I do not envisage any change at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">The President's view on the Middle East has switched somewhat in recent months. When I spoke to him last year on this issue, it was quite clear that the US Administration was not going to overly involve itself and it did not. It is now prepared to make more effort and to move on the road map. From my interpretation of my meeting with the President I do not believe the road map will produce results as quickly as many people think it will. However, I noted a different opinion from that of the President one year ago and a radically different opinion from that of two years ago, when I did not notice much sympathy. The President made the point strongly to me that he is now the first US President to call for two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side. That is now his formal position and is a sign of progress as it was not a position taken by previous US Presidents. The road map pushes out the parameters. The Prime Minister Mr. Blair and others are very anxious to move on it, and it can happen. I still take the view that if Mr. Sharon believes he is well protected, he will not move. The Americans will have to lean harder on him.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I am concerned that the pace of this process will be slow. There is a view internationally that until the new Administration is in and given a chance, people will not move. That seems to be the view of the UN, the EU and the US President. Perhaps, it will work out but I would like to see quicker movement with regard to the road map.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">On Northern Ireland, I have not given up and am not resigned to the situation there. However, I can understand that people have difficulties. If the President of Sinn Féin outlined to his Ard Fhéis that he saw the time scale differently to the way I would like him to see it, I will have to live with that position. That does not end anything but it would have been better to move on this, which would have increased confidence and progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The suggestion that Sinn Féin could come in at a later stage is not a real difficulty. The difficulties are in related areas. If somebody does not act on one aspect, somebody else will raise another aspect and there is a knock-on effect, which I fear. I took the opportunity to meet some of the other leaders over the weekend, including the SDLP and Mr. Trimble who came in yesterday, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has been in contact with some others.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">From our perspective in dealing with these issues in the fairest and best way, if all parties move together that would be best but, if that is not possible, we will have to try to do it in a slightly different way to accommodate that. Ultimately, it is important that Sinn Féin participates, plays an active role on the policing boards, encourages young Nationalists to join the new police service in Northern Ireland and that the party will play a significant role in the reform and enhancement of the police service. It would be better to start that now, but if it has to be later, we will have to deal with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">To deal with Questions Nos. 16 and 17, which I have tabled, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this US Administration and its predecessor have played a constructive part in the Irish peace process. Does the Taoiseach agree that it demeans the peace process and the Irish people to suggest that the Government should not strongly oppose the US-UK war on Iraq? Does he agree that it is wrong that Ireland should abandon its neutrality and independent foreign policy on the grounds that to do otherwise might offend the US President, Mr. Bush? Does he reject, as I do, the outrageous notion that we should trade war in Iraq for peace in Ireland? I have read such comments, which should be rejected, in the print media and I have heard the echoes of them elsewhere. I hope the Taoiseach will join me in rejecting such arguments. Is it not the case that Irish people, as true friends of the people of the United States, have a duty – we owe it to them – to state honestly our views in relation to the war in Iraq? The view of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, which has been demonstrated on many occasions, is one that we sincerely—</p>

          <p eId="para_184">The Deputy asked a question at the end of his contribution, although I am not so sure about some of his earlier comments. I cannot determine whether the war is illegal. Only two bodies can determine whether it is illegal – the United Nations and an international legal body. The resolution of the legal uncertainty which has existed in relation to the situation for many months rests with the two bodies. I cannot say whether the war is legal or illegal. That has been the position since 8 November last. People were frustrated by the amount of times that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I pointed out the difficulties that would arise from that. We have said all along that the difficulties will continue, which is why we said that Resolution 1441 is a good resolution which reflected many of the other issues but it did not answer the other two resolutions that people have used to justify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The Deputy also asked a clear question about whether there is a trade-off between the war in Iraq and the peace process. Nobody has taken such a position during the discussions I have attended. I know that Deputy Ó Caoláin does not like to hear this, but I repeat that I do not consider that we have changed our position in relation to neutrality nor do I think we have changed our independence or deviated one iota from it. I have held the UN position to a far greater extent that many other people. I have argued that position with my EU colleagues and I expressed that point of view to the President, although I would not say that I argued with him. Ireland has faithfully stood with the UN throughout this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">In so far as the landing and stopover facilities are helpful to the United States, they are helpful to the United States. If we had not offered the facilities, the US would have gone elsewhere. I have been asked whether the assistance counts as a friendly act, but legally, Ireland is not participating in the war. That is the international, domestic and legal position. That is the advice we have received.</p>

I invite Deputy Ó Caoláin to assess the potential perception of a withdrawal of facilities among Irish-Americans. As Minister for Labour at a time when 18.8% of people were unemployed, I answered questions and was criticised in this House. I was asked how I could justify being part of an Administration at a time when a net total of 60,000 people had gone to the United States. Some 50,000 people had gone from this country to the US five years in a row. I would not feel comfortable about saying to the 44 million Americans who claim to have an Irish heritage that this country is prepared to be totally difficult in a difficult situation.

          <p eId="para_209">The Minister for Defence offered the view yesterday that this tactic was used by the rainbow Government in the run-up to Christmas 1995. That may well be the case. I have not had the time to check his facts as I do not have as many people on the State payroll as the Minister. I will look into it. There is nothing unusual about using the guillotine at the end of a calendar year. It is unusual to use it as a governmental convenience on every parliamentary day in the first year of the life of a Government. It has been the tradition in this House that if Members on either side wish to make a contribution on a Bill, they are provided with a reasonable opportunity to do so. That tradition is not being followed in this case for no other reason than to facilitate Government business. The guillotine has become the norm. Will the Taoiseach assure the House concerning matters which have been regarded as precedent, and you, a Cheann Comhairle, have correctly ruled that precedent is important? Will he assure the House that a reasonable amount of time will be allowed between the conclusion of Second Stage of a Bill and its referral to a select committee and that the unreasonable application of the guillotine in the circumstances we are seeing every day will cease? This is not an acceptable way to do business. Since the Minister for Defence accuses those on this side of the House of wasting time, will he tell me what other parliamentary method is open to us to express our objection to this manner of doing business?</p>

The circumstances in which we are taking the National Tourism Development Authority Bill 2002 are changing all the time. The impact of the war on Iraq will mean tourism must redefine itself to take account of the consequent downturn in business. That is not to mention the appalling humanitarian crisis we will debate later. The Government is avoiding dealing with the issue and I ask that the guillotine be removed to provide Members with the opportunity to develop the debate to take account of the reality being faced. We oppose the Order of Business as it seeks to avoid dealing with the issues regarding which we are here to represent the people.</p>

The Minister for Health and Children has made clear time and time again, both inside and outside the House, his commitment to the health strategy. Within that strategy there are clear commitments to promised legislation. I would like to ask the Taoiseach about legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement to health and personal social services. The Bill was to have been published in 2002. I would also like to ask the Taoiseach about a commitment to establish a national hospital agency by the end of 2002. What has happened to that legislation? I want to ask him about a commitment made in the health strategy, including annual statements of funding processes and allocations to be published both by the Department and the health boards. This was to occur in 2002. Will the Taoiseach respond to my questions on three pieces of promised legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_382">Before addressing the amendment I would like to say a few words about the future of the human resource function discharged by CERT. I had a second meeting with the representatives of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT unions in recent weeks to progress matters generally. I noted that there had been some concern on the part of CERT staff that the agency's human resource function would be downgraded in the new set-up. I made it clear to the union representatives that there is no intention of downgrading that function. Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) makes clear statutory provision for CERT type functions. It covers education, development, recruitment and training, in other words, the “ERT” of CERT. That in itself should send a clear message.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The Bill brings the human resources and services sides to the core of tourism development. All Ministers with responsibility for tourism will receive complaints from the public about tourism related matters. What is striking about these is that so many of them tend to be related not to the physical facilities but to service or quality related issues. There is a perception that we have made huge progress on the product side but that we may be slipping somewhat on the services side. That is certainly the essence I took from the Second Stage debate in the House. Addressing this issue is part of the fundamental rationale of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Regarding the amendment, at my meeting with the unions, concern was expressed that the current text of the Bill, while it allowed the authority to encourage, promote and support training, might not allow it to engage in it. While I believe there is sufficiently broad language in the section, especially in section 8(1)(<i>b</i>), to allow the authority to continue to engage in training, I note that specific provision is made to allow the authority to engage in certain other activities. The reason for the difference is that various pieces of the text of the section come from different Tourist Traffic Acts. To remove any doubt and allay staff anxiety, I have decided to make the text more explicit and make it clear that the authority can engage in training. Deputy Deenihan's amendment has the same purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">From my contacts with the unions, the two main issues of concern on the CERT side, apart from the normal industrial relations issues, related to the future status of CERT's human resources activities under the authority and the specific concern about the text around training. I have addressed both of these today and hope that will be sufficient to allay anxieties.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Section 3 states: "The Authority may provide". The purpose of my amendment is to ensure the language used is consistent so that the section would read:</p>

I agree with him that the training and human resources brief of CERT should be emphasised after the merger and that there should be no dilution of that function. As we know, the human resource element of tourism in particular is very important at present when we look outside Ireland to recruit people for various roles in several sectors of the tourism industry, from receptionists to chefs to cooks and so on. This role of CERT will be even more important in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">In general terms I accept the thrust of Deputy Deenihan's amendment. I reflected on the matters in our most recent debate. During the Second Stage debate in the House, I was struck by the number of speakers who referred to the need to develop in a sensitive way the tourism potential around our language and associated culture. This amendment, while not strictly necessary, could send a useful signal in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The number of people who wish to visit Ireland for cultural purposes is often forgotten. A study some years ago in Scandinavia ascertained that a large number of people wished to visit the country for cultural reasons. This obtains in other countries as well. I am minded to accept the broad thrust of Deputy Deenihan's amendment for the reason that it could send a signal in regard to the recognition of culture as a valuable tourism asset.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I join in welcoming our friends from the Czech Republic. It is good to see tourists coming from there. A large number of Irish people, especially young people, travel to the Czech republic for weekend breaks. It is obviously a good reciprocal arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I thank the Minister for accepting the thrust of my amendment. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, Gaeltacht areas are an important part of our Irish tourism product. Many people come to Ireland because of the experience they get in areas such as the Donegal, Connemara and Kerry Gaeltachts and because of the difference in culture and the attractiveness of the language. If the new body is to set up tourist offices in these areas it is important that the people providing tourist information will be able to speak Irish and to give information through that medium. This provision would, hopefully, ensure that these people would be bilingual. It is a contradiction if someone seeking information regarding accommodation or local attractions in a Gaeltacht area has to deal with somebody who cannot interpret what they are saying through Irish.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_412">In page 8, after line 42, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_413">"(2) The Minister may establish a permanent inter-departmental review group comprising representatives of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Education and Science, as well as such other public bodies, as the Minister may from time to time determine, whose function shall be to advise the Minister and the National Tourism Development Authority on tourism policy especially in relation to the role of their own departments.".</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I moved this amendment on Committee Stage. The reason I move it again is that a number of reports on tourism have been published over the past six to 12 months. The reports highlight the fact that not enough attention is being given to tourism and that not enough State agencies are concerned about its value. This provision would ensure that the various Departments that have a direct influence on the development of tourism and all of the main stakeholders at Government level would be involved, in some way, in the decision making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">This would be a cross-departmental approach. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism would be the driving force. The Department of the Environment and Local Government would also have a major responsibility in regard to signposting which is a major issue for incoming tourists. There is a low standard of signposting across the country which is a cause of frustration to large numbers of tourists. People get lost on a daily basis coming into Dublin alone. They find it impossible to get out of Dublin port whether heading north, south or west.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Infrastructure is another important issue in regard to roads and the provision of sanitary facilities in tourist resorts. Planning is also an issue. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has a critical role to play. It has responsibility for our coastal areas to which tourists are naturally attracted. The potential of these areas for the development of tourism is considerable but it will not be realised unless the Department is in the decision making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The Department of Finance also has a critical role to play. ITIC published a report last September which stated that Irish tourism had lost its competitiveness and was pricing itself out of the market. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism advised at the time that the industry should reduce its costs. It is basically costs imposed on the industry by both Government and local authorities that create this lack of competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Lobbying was ongoing from September up to budget time for a reduction on the VAT rate on tourism products from 12.5% to 10%. It was expected that the Minister would make a move in that direction but instead the rate was increased by 1%. Now, at 13.5%, it is one of the highest VAT rates in the euro zone. In France, Portugal, Spain and Italy the average VAT rate on tourism products across the board is about 5%. The VAT on the charge for a €100 room in those countries would be €5 but here in Ireland it would be €13.50. We have lost competitiveness in that area instantly. The Department of Finance has a critical role to play in tourism policy and should be involved in the type of structure I propose.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Department of Agriculture and Food should also be involved. It is the food producer for the country and the food visitors eat is produced on our farms. Agri-tourism is under-capitalised and under-exploited. The Department of Education and Science has a role to play through the school system and the tourism courses it provides to students. It is training many of the leaders of the industry for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Minister rejected this proposal on Committee Stage but it is warranted now. There are similar structures in place to help other Departments both here and in other countries. It would give a more focused approach to tourism policy in the country. It would be more inclusive and would involve all the stakeholders at Government level. It would be an effective and helpful mechanism for the Minister and Fáilte Ireland. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_312" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_421">This amendment is unnecessary. This legislation is about the setting up of a tourism authority and not about my wider ministerial role. If I wanted to set up a committee, if that were appropriate, along the lines suggested by Deputy Deenihan, I could do so without recourse to legislation. In those circumstances I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">With regard to VAT rates, these are a separate issue and have no place in this legislation. VAT is a percentage of the total cost of a product and the higher the cost of the product, the higher the VAT. Recently I had the pleasure of launching, in conjunction with the Irish Restaurants Association, a new value-for-money menu for lunches and dinners in Irish restaurants which have signed up to this concept. The menu provides meals ranging from €10 to €30. This will be welcome in the context of the value for money debate in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">There is no point in us burying our heads in the sand. We have Bord Fáilte surveys which suggest that an increasing number of visitors perceive that the value for money we offer is not what it used to be. It would be foolish to ignore that. I have chosen not to ignore it and have advised the industry on the precise position and asked it to become more competitive. I am happy to say that the industry has responded positively and we are becoming more competitive. It is a tough world and we should be under no illusion but that competition in the marketplace is fierce.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">A visit to the recent world fair in London illustrated for anybody interested that more countries, in particular developing nations, are entering the marketplace. If one does not have a lean and hungry product some of the market share will disappear. It is as simple as that. Any comments I have made on the need to maintain competitiveness and to offer value for money have been offered in good faith in the interests of the industry. I am pleased the industry has responded in the food area. I sincerely hope there will be a similar response in the drinks area and that there will be a greater degree of competition in the marketplace. That is of immense importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">More than 90% of visitors to Ireland express satisfaction with the visit here. More than 80% say they would recommend it to a friend while a majority of the same visitors here perceive that value for money in Ireland is not what it used to be. If we are to maintain our share of the marketplace and increase it, we have to ensure our product is competitive. I will take whatever measure is required to ensure this happens. There has been a very positive response from the food sector and I sincerely hope a similar response is forthcoming in the not too distant future from the drinks sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">The Minister did not address the thrust of my amendment. In the context of finance I mentioned the importance of VAT to tourism competition but he availed of the opportunity I afforded him to make a contribution about competitiveness and what is happening in the restaurant industry. Obviously the Minister will not accept the amendment. If something is enshrined in legislation it would have to be put in place, otherwise it would be up to a particular Minister to put in place the type of structure I am recommending. If in the future the Minister considers this would be a useful or an appropriate structure, in the event that tourism continues to experience challenging times as at present, I suggest he look at it as a way of bringing all State agencies together which may make a contribution to tourism.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_429">Sometimes we get far more out of a direct bilateral engagement with individual Departments responsible for issues which affect tourism than from such committees. Once our institutional reform package is completed we will focus on engaging more closely with a couple of other Departments on other issues critical to tourism. For example, the issue of access is of immense importance. If we are to be effective we will have to draw on the expertise and insight of a strong national and regional tourism development structure. That will be a critical part of the authority's work. Tourism is part of a complex web of interaction. There are many things which happen outside of tourism which impact on tourism and which need attention. I understand this is a theme which is emerging strongly in the review group on tourism policy which I set up some time ago. Out of that work I hope we can get a consensus on the priority areas so far as tourism impact is concerned and the priority outcomes which the tourism sector requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Once we have those, I and my Department, the authority and the industry, can adopt a unified approach with the key players to raise the awareness of tourism needs and to secure the best outcome for the Irish tourism industry from their decisions. It would be wrong at this stage to prejudge the outcome of the review group's work or to anticipate its recommendations. There is little doubt it will have its own views on the best way to proceed. I look forward to the group's deliberations which I sincerely hope can be given effect in so far as the recommendations will serve the best interests of the industry.</p>

The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is one that should be involved in any process because the licensing laws which were designed to facilitate tourism are having the opposite effect. Certainly the extension of the licensing laws is giving us a bad reputation as visitors see what is happening on the streets late at night when young people pile out on to the streets. This is an issue about which the Minister should have serious discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Although he does not claim to be responsible, it was the Minister present who introduced the new licensing laws. Rather than make a positive contribution to the image of the tourism product they have the opposite effect and are not presenting a positive image for Ireland due to the mayhem on the streets late in the evening, in front of tourists, when young people come out on to the streets drunk and there is a major public order problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">Thank you for the opportunity. I will be brief. The reality is that the licensing laws are a separate issue. They were agreed to by all sides of the House. An Oireachtas committee dealt with the legislation and brought forward recommendations which were implemented unanimously by the House. As I recall the legislation going through the House, many Members wanted the laws to be more liberal but I did not relent. I understand there is a report from the Intoxicating Liquor Licensing Commission which will point the way forward but I am not aware of any radical recommendations in that report in relation to the actual licensing hours. The difficulties which Deputy Deenihan pointed out exist. It is important to recognise that the legislation was introduced in the main at the behest of an all-party Oireachtas committee and agreed unanimously by the House.</p>

I am sorry I did not make a stronger case at the time in respect of the continued opening hours on Sunday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. This has major implications for family life and sporting life. This is particularly evident in rural Ireland where there is a problem. It is good to have the benefit of hindsight. Obviously, in this case a major mistake has been made. I accept what the Minister has said that an all-party Oireachtas committee made the recommendations and that some Members sought greater liberalisation of the laws. I honestly believe we should reflect on that part of the legislation to see what can be done. It is having an effect on rural Ireland, family life and sports clubs, especially small rural GAA, soccer and rugby clubs, where there is a difficulty in maintaining numbers to sustain the club's existence. As we progress we should try to see whether it is possible to change that section of the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">In page 11, line 44, after "members" to insert "of which 5 or more shall be women".</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This Government and its predecessor have a very poor record regarding the appointment of women to State boards. When I was a Minister of State I had responsibility for two State boards, one of which was Bord na gCon. It was emphasised to me that at least 40% of the membership of that board must be women and I appointed three women. The Minister recently appointed one women to that board and it now consists of six men and one woman. Despite the guidelines which were put in place in 1991 and the commitment given by the Government at that time to implement the recommendations of the second commission on the status of women that Ministers and Departments should "ensure that at least 40% of all nominations to State boards would be women", the last two Governments have consistently failed to implement these guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The National Women's Council of Ireland recently produced an important document, Irish Politics – Jobs for the Boys. It outlines clearly the number of women who serve on State boards. Of the boards that are important to tourism the board of Aer Lingus has 12 members and one woman, Aer Rianta has nine board members and one woman, Bord Bia has 15 board members and three women and Bord Fáilte has eight board members and two women. Bord Gáis Éireann has eight board members and one woman, Dublin Bus has nine board members and one woman, the Central Bank of Ireland has 12 board members and no woman, the Dublin Transportation Office has 15 board members and one woman, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has ten board members and two women, IDA Ireland has 12 board members and two women, the Medical Council has 29 board members and six women, Teagasc has 11 board members and two women and Údarás na Gaeltachta has 20 board members and two women.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">That is not a complete list of State bodies but it clearly indicates a trend. Ministers have given numerous assurances in answer to parliamentary questions that the Government is striving to put gender equality in place, but it is not. I quote from the NWCI publication:</p>
          <p eId="para_444">However, the poor record of previous Governments and nominating bodies would suggest that what is ultimately needed is legislation making it compulsory for each Minister to ensure that 40% of members of each State board are women.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">That is what this amendment does. I will put this amendment to a vote if the Minister does not accept it. At least five members of the board should be women but the number need not be confined to five.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The tourism industry is driven by women at hotel level and in decision making. Most of the people at tourism industry conferences are women. The enthusiasm of the industry comes from women and some of the industry's greatest leaders, even in my own and the Minster's county, are women. That enthusiasm is not reflected on the various industry boards because women are not given the opportunity to display it. My amendment will guarantee that opportunity in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I know the Minister agrees that it is important to include women in the decision making processes of this industry. Tourist numbers are divided equally among men and women and women's needs must be taken into consideration at macro and micro level. They must be considered when broad policy decisions are made as well as when accommodation, attractions and facilities are being provided. For example, golf is very successfully promoted as one of our greatest tourism products. However, no attention is given to the golfer's wife who is not a golfer. No attention is given to providing something for her to do in a place where there might be nothing but a golf course. In the provision of swimming pools and gymnasia consideration is seldom given to the provision of creche facilities so that a woman who wants to work out in a gym can do so while her children are looked after. A large number of issues related to the needs of women are not being addressed in our tourism industry, principally because not enough women are putting forward their case at decision making level. This is true throughout the industry, from national to local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Minister would make a very good statement by accepting this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_449">When I spoke on earlier stages of this Bill I said I broadly welcomed the idea of putting the two organisations together but that my party would not support the Bill because it is fundamentally flawed in terms of integrating the tourism experience. As Deputy Deenihan has pointed out, unless the issues of road and rail access, waste, litter and justice are linked and unless a tourism body is given some clout in dealing with Departments the measure will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I support Deputy Deenihan's amendment because it attempts to put some common sense on to a highly flawed document. The Green Party recently called for a 40-60 gender balance on all State boards and among nominated members of local authorities and Dáil candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The Minister has tabled an amendment saying he shall, "in so far as is practicable, endeavour to ensure. . . an equitable balance between men and women". That balderdash is an insult to women who, in many cases, have driven the tourism industry. Is the Minister saying there are not sufficient women with the necessary business and life experience to play a meaningful role in the development of tourism policy? Either there are qualified women available for the job or there are not. Many State boards and prison visiting committees consist of political appointees whose appointments are merely a reward for a job they did in the past but who do not have relevant qualifications. Qualified women are available in spades in the tourism industry. They include people who have set up their own businesses, who employ people in the tourism industry or who have families and know what a struggle it is to transport children from one place to another. Any of these could play a valuable role in developing tourism policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I support the amendment. Women can play a role. If the Minister is serious he should support this amendment. It is practical to have at least 40% of women on the board of the new body. They have the necessary experience. If the Minister does not support this amendment he will send out a dangerous message to women at a time when the economy is in difficulty and we must add value to our tourism product. Tourism is often referred to as a product. Ireland has many visitors from abroad because of its tourism experience. I put it to the Minister that men and women being different but equal, women are much better at getting across the idea of Ireland being a tourism experience rather than a bland product. The Minister should have the courage of his convictions and support this amendment rather than putting in a wishy-washy alternative?</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I fully support the amendment. It is time we put actual numbers into the legislation rather than an aspiration as is proposed in the Minister's amendment. Aspirations are fine but the Minister of the day may find it difficult to initiate an investigation as to the best possible constitution of the board. Usually people are appointed who are known to staff within a Department or are known to members of various associated bodies. There is no in-depth investigation to ensure there is a representative cross-section.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I agree with Deputy Deenihan that women have led the charge in regard to tourism. This is evident in all aspects of tourism, from hotel ownership to promotional work and even in regard to travel companies. Women have been to the fore in advancing tourism. I cannot see why it is not possible to specify the number. It is said that politics is a numbers game but appointments to State boards should also be a numbers game. We should be committed to achieving a gender balance to ensure that women have a say in regard to this important area. The Minister has said, time and again, both in the House and outside it, that the appointment to this authority is one of the major investments in tourism. He said that he wants to have the appointments made before the tourism season starts, with which I agree. We should not accede to his amendment. We should have the courage of our convictions and stipulate a number rather than merely having an aspiration in regard to this aspect of the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_455">Deputy Deenihan referred to a number of State boards which have a low percentage of women on them. Last week I got a response from the Minister in regard to the appointment of people with disabilities to State boards. It appears that there are very few. While I agree with the case being made for women, the case should also be made for people with disabilities. In many respects Ministers only rubber stamp the appointments. In future, will the Minister appoint people with disabilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_456">In view of the dependence of the west and south of Ireland on tourism, will the Minister and the Government resist the intervention by Europe in regard to the bilateral agreement for Shannon? If the open skies policy is introduced and Shannon is bypassed, the future for the south and west of Ireland is bleak.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_457">It is my wish that there would be as many women as possible serving on State boards. Some years ago a directive was issued to the effect that 40% of members of State boards should be women. While this objective has been reached on at least some boards, it is also fair to say that there are boards where it has not been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I agree that it is of immense importance that there be a gender balance on boards, particularly on one such as the National Tourism Development Authority, which is why I proposed an amendment to Deputy Deenihan's amendment. His amendment provides that there would have to be five or more women on the board, but it does not state that there would have to be five or more men, which could give rise to the argument that Deputy Deenihan is being discriminatory against men—</p>

I am ensuring that it will be incumbent on the Minister of the day to endeavour to the best of his or her ability to ensure that among the members of the authority there is equivalence in terms of gender balance. That is reasonable. There is already a statutory imperative on the Minister of the day to ensure that there will be equivalence. No Minister can ignore that and if he or she does ignore it, he or she can be brought to account in this House for being in breach of statutory obligations. The Minister can be asked to account for how he or she endeavoured to comply with the statutory requirement. That is reasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">It is not the only provision of this kind. There is a similar provision in regard to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 and also in the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998. The problem with Deputy Deenihan's amendment, aside from the difficulty which I have already outlined, is that it is far too rigid and does not allow the necessary degree of flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">In formulating the National Tourism Development Authority, I will do everything I can to ensure there is a gender balance, in so far as that is possible. I do not think a subsequent Minister would be foolish enough to ignore the statutory provision I am proposing which allows a certain degree of flexibility but which demands that the Minister of the day endeavours to ensure there is a gender balance on the board.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_470">Unless it is enshrined in legislation, it will not happen. This was pointed out by the National Women's Council of Ireland. The Minister referred to the board of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which currently only has two women out of ten while IDA Ireland has only two women out of 12 on its board.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The regional tourism authorities, which are important for the development of tourism at a regional level, confirm that women are playing a small role in decision making. Dublin Tourism has five women out of 25; the midlands-east region has two out of 21; the north-west region has three out of 19; the south-east region has six out of 17; the south-west region has four out of 16 and the western region has four out of 16. This confirms my argument that it needs to be enshrined in legislation, which was demanded by the National Women's Council of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, might do it but who knows what will happen after that. The women of Ireland will not be happy unless it is enshrined in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I was careful to ensure that there were three women on the board of Bord na gCon in 1997 but subsequently there has been no woman on the board. If it was enshrined in legislation that 40% of board members had to be women there would still be three women on that board. I am making the argument because of my past experience of being involved in this process. That is why I put forward the amendment and I will put it to a vote.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_475">I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 109 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. While the threat of terrorist attacks in this jurisdiction is the subject of continual analysis and assessment by both the Garda and the Defence Forces, the advice available to me is that there is no current credible threat to Ireland. Notwithstanding that, it is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continual review.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place in relation to the provision of aid to the civil power and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities for a range of emergencies. In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning. The objective of the task force is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any largescale emergency. As Chairman of this task force, my objective is to ensure that such responses continue to be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The Office of Emergency Planning, which operates under my remit in the Department of Defence, is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threats from global terrorism, including co-ordination of Government emergency planning and responses by various agencies. Review and updating of existing emergency plans is ongoing to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response to large-scale emergencies. An urgent and detailed review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergencies was undertaken by the military authorities following from the events of 11 September. It included, <i>inter alia,</i> an update of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment, including the need for air defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were also reassessed. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required. In accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality, Ireland does not participate in a military alliance or in any mutual defence pact with other nations. No agreements, therefore, exist between Ireland and any other State for military assistance in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_480">I agree with the Minister the Garda Síochána has a major security role to play, but in the event of such an attack, will the Minister agree that the Defence Forces have a very important role? We are currently almost on the precipice of a world conflict between religions and cultures, and Ireland could be a target for international terrorists. I do not see how the Minister can say with confidence that there is no threat to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It is well known that terrorists go for soft targets. We all remember what happened in Bali in 2002. That was a soft target, and there are a number of such targets in this country. We need air cover to protect our citizens. Does the Minister believe that we have adequate air cover to protect ourselves, or would we have to call upon the assistance of another power, as the Minister indicated in the Dáil on 19 February? Is there an agreement, either formal or informal, with another power, such as the United States, for example? We have provided Shannon Airport as a facility to the US military. Is there a <i>quid pro quo</i>? Have they offered us assistance in the event of such an attack? Will the Minister agree that we do not have adequate resources for the rapid deployment of troops within the State? We have highly skilled and trained Army personnel, but do we have adequate air cover or do we have an arrangement with another country, formal or informal? Do we have adequate equipment and resources for the rapid deployment of our security and defence personnel in case of a terrorist attack?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_343" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_482">The Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces share information and have considerable contact with intelligence sources outside of the State. I rely completely on the advice given by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in these matters, and I am continually in touch with both. There will be a further meeting of the task force tomorrow afternoon. On each occasion, whether the meetings are daily or weekly, the first item on the agenda is the threat assessment. The advice at present is that there are no current credible threats to this country, and it is very important that people not be unduly alarmed. That said, it is necessary to take every precaution possible in the event of something happening. Nobody can give absolute guarantees.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The Defence Forces possess a range of air defence assets, including radar for detection and weapons systems. The Defence Forces possess one Giraffe mobile air defence radar with a range of up to 40 kilometres and eight Flycatcher mobile air defence fire control radar, with a range of 20 kilometres. On air defence weapons, Defence Forces have 24 Beaufort L70 air defence guns.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I made it clear on the last occasion that even the wealthiest and best armed countries have a real difficulty when it comes to air defence. Given the amount of traffic between London and Dublin Airport, one would need aircraft in the skies continually if one were to have any prospect of dealing with the type of circumstances the Deputy outlined. It is important to know that when talking about international terrorism, we are talking about the international community and about all our contacts and friends in the European Union. While we cannot discuss security issues of this nature, as it is not the practice to do so publicly, the Deputy can be assured that the resources of this State and the contacts we have would be used to the best possible extent should an attack of that kind be imminent, although the advice to me is that is it not.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">As far as the transport of Defence Force members is concerned, we have never had a difficulty anywhere in the country. We have the best transport facilities we have ever had.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 59 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The Government has decided to replace the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft King Air in the ministerial air transport role. The decision was necessary to meet the ever increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The tender process for the acquisition of the aircraft is now in train with the preparation of tender documentation in my Department. This work is nearing completion and it is expected that the requisite notices in relation to the tender competitions will issue to the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> later this week. A separate competition is being held for the two aircraft, both of which should be available for operational service by 1 October 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The replacement for the Gulfstream IV will have the capacity to operate in the long range executive transport role. The aircraft must be capable of operation from a 6,000 foot runway carrying at least 25 passengers and five crew to a destination of not less than 3,500 nautical miles non stop. It must also have the capacity to fly in excess of 5,000 nautical miles non stop. The replacement for the Beechcraft King Air must be capable of operation from a 4,800 foot runway carrying seven passengers to a destination of not less than 1,500 nautical miles non stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The tender competition for both aircraft will allow for the submission of both new and pre-owned aircraft. All options, such as outright purchase, lease, lease purchase and other alternatives, will be considered. The highly competitive nature of the aviation market at present should result in competitive packages being offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">In tandem with proposals for the supply of the aircraft, tenderers may also outline offers for the Gulfstream IV aircraft as at the proposed date of hand-over of the tendered aircraft or in mid-July 2004 following the EU Presidency. Offers for the Beechcraft King Air will also be considered in tandem with proposals for its replacement.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The acquisition of aircraft will be the subject of detailed cost benefit analysis, including value for money and comparison with costs associated with alternative arrangements. The responses to the tender process will determine the most advantageous system of payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The actual cost of the acquisition of the aircraft can only be defined after the tender competition, particularly in view of the fact that pre-owned aircraft are a consideration. There is no provision in the 2003 Defence Vote for the acquisition of the aircraft. Additional funding for the proposed aircraft will have to be identified.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeSherlock" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_496">I understand the proposed figure is around €63 million. Does the Minister accept it reflects a strange sense of priorities to spend this kind of public money on the acquisition of aircraft for the convenience of Ministers at a time when an elderly woman lay on a hospital trolley for 16 days, children with a disability are being deprived of hot meals and people are being deprived of the home help service? Does he accept that the decision is a slap in the face to members of the Air Corps who were told only last year – I understand the Minister made this point – that there was no money to acquire long promised medium lift helicopters which are urgently required for air rescue service operations? Is it intended to bring forward a Supplementary Estimate for the provision of this jet?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_346">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_497">Let me scotch the notion that there is a set figure for the purchase of these aircraft. It would be very injudicious in the context of tendering that that should be the position. In the event of the purchase of second-hand aircraft or of leasing or lease purchase over a five or ten year period, the type of money about which one would be talking would be infinitesimal compared to the amount the Deputy contends it might be. In regard to the impact that would have on the services about which the Deputy spoke, there is no provision this year. It could be very late this year before any aircraft is acquired and there may be very few funds to be provided this year, so we should not jump to conclusions or make a comparison in the way the Deputy has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In the context of the work of Ministers in Europe and elsewhere, critical decisions are taken about this country in Europe and the service this transport provides and the capacity it gives to a Government to represent this country and to do what needs to be done to protect its interests is very valuable. The Gulfstream IV has, by any standards, earned its cost over and over in terms of the facilities it has provided to successive Governments. We were able to purchase that aircraft at a time when 16% to 17% of the people were unemployed. We now have a 4.7% unemployment rate. We have one of the strongest economies in Europe and a major factor in that has been the advances we have made in the European Union and the way we have been able to negotiate funds for a wide range of services for this country which have dramatically improved and helped to develop our economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_499">I draw the Minister's attention to another aspect of the Government jet and the running of the service. Is he familiar with the information which became available at the weekend in regard to the high cost of providing sustenance and creature comforts to those travelling on the Government jet? We were led to believe it cost in excess of €100,000 for one year to provide gourmet meals, vintage wines, handmade chocolates and scents and perfumes of the designer kind. It is reminiscent of the one of the chapters of the dying days of the Roman Empire or of an Ottoman sultan's court. Can this be justified? When the rest of us are tightening our belts – Deputy Sherlock mentioned some of the cuts – members of the Government are loosening their belts at the expense of the taxpayer. Who is responsible for the purchase of these provisions? Are any accounting procedures adhered to? What financial controls are in place? Are fair tendering processes engaged in? Will the Minister confirm or deny these reports we read at the weekend about the bill for food and drink on the Government jet being sky high?</p>

          <p eId="para_500">As the Deputy knows, the Government jet has been in service for 12 years. Before I came into the House, I checked the record to see whether the rainbow Government Ministers had complained about the services of the Gulfstream IV during their term in office only to find that they praised the Air Corps for its professionalism, dedication and commitment. It is important to note that the service provided is business class. Wine and other products are purchased in a normal, commercial manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Having said that, I have travelled on the jet on a number of occasions and have experienced no excesses. I stand over the work of the Air Corps which provides for a significantly higher number of hours than stated in the press article to which the Deputy refers – I think the article mentions 386 hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">The figure should be 513 hours. The jet catered for 1,600 passengers, including the crew. I have tried since I became Minister for Defence to achieve value for money wherever possible. The record will show that the Department of Defence faced up to the challenges before it, whether it was the sale of surplus property, hearing impairment claims or otherwise. Purchases must sometimes be made in other countries but I will work to ensure that we obtain the most economic provisions and that there are no excesses. The Government led by Deputy McGinley's party was very happy with the services provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">Does the Minister accept that the morale of the Air Corps has been damaged by this proposal in view of the promise to provide medium lift helicopters? If such progress is being made in getting the deal together, will the Government require a Supplementary Estimate?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_505">In response to the Minister's reply, I recently travelled business class on Aer Lingus and was given only a bun in a poke. Some sort of meal used to be provided but one now gets a bun in a poke between Dublin and Brussels, which is quite adequate for my needs. At a time of economic retrenchment when there have been cutbacks with regard to carers, housing and education, and people are being treated on hospital trolleys, we could legitimately expect Government economy in this area also.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">In reply to Deputy Sherlock, the question of a Supplementary Estimate does not arise at this stage. That will depend on how the tender process develops, what resources are required this year and what other arrangements are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The morale of the Air Corps has never been higher. If the Deputy drives to Baldonnel, he will see a beautiful new hangar which cost £4 million. When I became Minister for Defence, there was only an old prefab for the helicopter unit, which was a scandal, and I swore we would get rid of that. A fantastic new building is now in its place. Some €6 million has been spent on improving the runway and the Air Corps has a €60 million contract for flying aircraft. The Air Corps has never been better looked after. I would welcome a visit from Deputy Sherlock to meet Air Corps members and to satisfy him about what I have said.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_510">On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999. The Permanent Defence Forces are now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Forces will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Forces will take place over a period of approximately six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Forces. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to take part in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I am very mindful of the need to preserve and retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">As regards the future of the reserve in the Sligo area, no final decisions have been made. While I can confirm that it is proposed to retain the 5 Field CIS Company as a reserve unit, no decision has yet been made as to its future location. I assure the Deputy that there will continue to be a reserve presence in Sligo, but it may have a different role in the new organisation than it has at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">It seems that there is a possibility of relocating the signal unit to Athlone. What is the logic of that? This unit not only trains young recruits in the operation of signalling equipment but in the operation of information systems. Does the Minister not agree that if there is one unit which is suitable above any other to relocate away from a parent unit, it is one which depends on information technology? It makes more sense to transmit information by computer than to have to move heavy artillery. There is no logic to moving the signal unit. Much is heard about the roll out of broadband and of technology to the regions. If this transfer occurs, it will surely mean a roll back. It would only be possible to recruit 25 new members for the Reserve Defence Forces in the town. Sligo town is earmarked as a growth centre and a gateway. Does the Minister not agree that, were this to happen, it would amount to the removal of opportunities for training and participation in very positive activities in terms of the comradeship and affirmation that many young people need? Much is heard at present about the lack of facilities for young people and related alcohol problems. It would be a backward step if this unit was taken from Sligo. These opportunities are crucial for young people in Sligo town.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I agree with Deputy Harkin with regard to the geographical spread, the importance of the voluntary ethos and the service the force provides. It is important to note that the basis of this is a reorganisation of the reserve which the reserve itself wanted in the context of declining numbers and inadequate clothing, training and equipment. This is an attempt to prepare for the future in terms of having a much improved, enhanced reserve. It would have the capacity, for the first time, to engage in training at a level which would enable members of the Reserve Defence Forces to serve overseas, should they so wish if they meet the special criteria that will be outlined. These are ambitious targets which will be met over the coming years. No decisions have yet been taken about the location of any service and the process will take a number of years to settle down. I have received broad proposals from the defence forces but there are no specifics with regard to where units will go. I do not foresee reserve centres closing down in any part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">However, because there is a need to enhance training, there is a need for more centralised training, which might be in Sligo, Donegal, Roscrea, Templemore or elsewhere. However, there must be geared-up training for the type of service which it is expected the reserve will provide. It is also important that we realise that we will not attract young people into the FCA, as we have done in the past, if facilities and equipment are out of date. We have to be much more modern and to provide much better facilities, which is why I tried, in the interim, to provide new equipment such as star rifles and clothing to indicate to the Reserve that the Government is committed to improving the service, including the training days.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_520">The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was commented on in the report of the Gleeson commission in 1990. The matter had been of serious concern to the military authorities for a number of years. The age profile of the Defence Forces personnel was also the subject of severe criticism by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consultants who had been engaged by the efficiency audit group to conduct an in-depth study of the Defence Forces. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The group's report was accepted by the Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five-year contract basis, with a Reserve Defence Force commitment of seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The recruitment of personnel on five-year contracts was introduced following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. Agreement was reached with PDFORRA in 1997 on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, which applies to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provides that service for private soldiers is initially for five years, with an option of being extended to a maximum of 12 years. Any extension is subject to the individual soldier meeting certain criteria, including standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service are envisaged for junior and senior non-commissioned officers. The 1997 policy represents a substantial improvement for personnel who would otherwise have had to leave after five years' service. It continues to address the issues of age profile and fitness levels in the Defence Forces. I am satisfied with these arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">PDFORRA recently submitted a claim, under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. As discussions on issues raised under the scheme are confidential to the parties concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_523">Did the Minister's reply mention that the claim made under the conciliation and arbitration scheme is being considered? I understand that PDFORRA made a submission under the scheme. Can the Minister tell the House how many members of the Defence Forces are likely to be discharged in 2006? Does the Minister think it is reasonable to train people for early discharge after 12 years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_524">It is never easy to make decisions about manpower and putting in place the best system. The basis for the policy change, which resulted in the five-year contract, was that the age profile in the Defence Forces was too high and was out of line with the rest of Europe. The maximum service of 12 years was then negotiated. PDFORRA's submission under the conciliation and arbitration scheme is being considered at present. Some 118 privates who joined the Defence Forces in 1994 are still serving. It is clear that a number of them will be promoted to the rank of corporal before 2006, so it is not possible to say how many will be discharged in that year.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Soldiering is a business for young men and women internationally. Age profile is a tremendously important matter as it affects the fitness of the force. There needs to be a balance, however, as people who are highly trained and dedicated should be able to serve the country as members of the Defence Forces for as long a period as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 69, 94 and 108 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve Defence Force. The group, which I established to undertake a study of the Reserve Defence Force, reported to me in September 1999. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes will take place over a period of six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its nationwide geographical spread, an aspect which will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Defence Force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units, in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have been taken on the location of the proposed newly amalgamated units, but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve force consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units, to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will comprise the overall Army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Members of the FCA are seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing, improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops, there will be additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the Reserve Defence Force, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the Reserve Defence Force with the Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">An important change recommended in the study of the Reserve Defence Force, which was also contained in the White Paper on Defence, is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions in other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation. Any matters relating to overseas service by members of the Reserve Defence Force which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The security of civilian employment for the members of the Reserve Defence Force who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I emphasise that I am mindful of the need to preserve and retain the many traditional and well-established strengths of the current Reserve Defence Force system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_539">Perhaps the Minister's reply contained the information I seek, but I will ask my question anyway. Can the Minister tell the House whether a definite decision has been taken to allow members of the FCA to participate in overseas peacekeeping operations, as they have sought? If so, what efforts have been made to ascertain the various skills that they would need to have? Is it planned to audit the skills of the Reserve Defence Force?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I was delighted to include a provision in the White Paper on Defence, the first ever such paper, to enable members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve overseas. It is quite common, as I said in my reply, for reservists from other countries to serve on overseas peace support missions. We are looking forward to developing the Reserve Defence Force in a certain manner. Additional training and extra facilities will provide new opportunities. It will take some time. Specialist areas, where we have shortages and regular difficulties meeting overseas mission requirements under UN mandates from the Permanent Defence Forces, are the first issues that must be addressed. Reserve members have other employment which they must be sure is available to them when they return from overseas duty. There are also questions of dealing with the representative associations and deciding how the new arrangements will ultimately operate. The principle has been established and the plan to ensure that the training is put in place is evolving. Ultimately, we will achieve our goal.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_541">Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that prior to members of the Reserve being allowed to participate in international peacekeeping operations, there must be an amalgamation of the Reserve and the Permanent Defence Forces? If that is the plan, what are the implications for FCA installations in parts of the country in which there are no PDF facilities? I may have missed reference to the matters in the Minister's initial reply and I would appreciate clarification.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I am not sure I covered those aspects of the matter adequately. Reserve members will not join the Permanent Defence Forces. Under the new arrangements, 2,656 members of the Reserve will be brought up to PDF standard through more centralised training. For geographical reasons, it will not be possible for members in every part of the country to attain PDF level, although I would love to think we could do it. I need to be practical and honest about this. The closer Reserve members live to headquarters and to mainstream facilities, the better are their options. Otherwise, they would have inordinately long journeys to make which would affect their ability to protect their permanent employment and their family life. The process does not involve membership of the PDF, it involves opening to Reserve members for the first time the facilities to train and advance their capacity to enable them to participate in overseas missions. As I observed to Deputy Sherlock, the process will initially begin with more specialist groups who will not have to engage in the type of training I am referring to. Doctors, dentists, mechanics and those who have specialised training in communications technology or a raft of other areas are the people I have in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">Will primary or secondary legislative changes be required to allow reserve members to serve overseas? What are the cost implications of bringing the reserve up to the standards the Minister points out are required in terms of man hours, extra equipment and training? Have projections been made in that regard? Does the Minister plan to expand the role of the Reserve to include drug interdiction or other matters, or will its primary function continue to be training?</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_546">Under discussion is an enhanced contingency role. We will not recruit committed reservists unless we continue to evolve opportunities such as overseas service. It would be impossible to define the cost implications, although there will be some. There may also be hidden savings if this develops as we think it might. I do not intend to go into them, but Deputies will be able to work them out quickly for themselves. The tendency is always that there are additional costs while savings are rare.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">No legislation appears to be required to permit overseas service by reservists. If we need to introduce changes, we will have the opportunity to make provisions through primary legislation. I would rather postpone a decision on that until we have developed the negotiation process.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I agree with the Minister that this is a young person's game. Perhaps it is just as well that there is a prohibition on the participation of Members of this House. I wonder about the compatibility of equipment for the reserve if we get to the stage that its members are deployed overseas. Will significant funding be required to upgrade and procure weapons and equipment?</p>

          <p eId="para_551">I do not want to take unwarranted credit for changes, but I was ashamed of the resources provided to the FCA when I became Minister for Defence. Since I took office, all the new uniforms have been provided and the Steyr rifle has been made available. We are improving equipment as much as we can. There will be some cost implications, but Deputies should realise that amalgamated units and centralised training will provide opportunities to avail of many existing provisions. Over time there will be some cost implications, although it may be possible to off-set them in other areas. There is no point in talking about developing the reserve if we do not provide it with the resources it needs to perform to the full extent of its ability.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_376">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_553">The Petersberg Tasks are unquestionably included under UN mandates. The question of peace enforcement could arise, but it is not something one can make a judgment on before a particular case occurs. To engage in such missions, Dáil and Government approval would be required and there would be a need to ascertain security risks through proper reconnaissance. To anticipate in advance and commit oneself to something without reference to a particular example would be injudicious. We will just have to wait and see.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_554">How long will it be before members of the reserve will be able to serve overseas? Will the Minister ensure that the section of the reserve that will not be integrated will not be left on the sidelines? Could he tell us what their role will be? How would they be deployed in any operational work? What expanded role could they have in order to make it interesting for them as well?</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I would expect the first members to serve overseas in the life-time of this Government. That is subject to concluding negotiations with the representative associations to work out the question of secure employment and various other things with the employers and ensure that people are not obligated but free and secure when they return to take up their posts. That applies primarily in the more specialised areas in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Deputy has asked an extremely difficult question with regard to the 9,500 members of the reserve for whom this is not an option. It would be tempting to say we intend to apply this to them all, and the Deputy would know that was false. A great number of the members are based in parts of west Cork, Donegal, and Mayo. I would love to be able to say the same thing about Dublin City, Cork City, and Limerick where we need to involve people in the voluntary service of reserve. Much of the early work will involve efforts to establish the reserve in places such as Tallaght, Clondalkin and elsewhere where that fantastic ethos which is being built around the reserve can be built up. We can then see what additional work and services it can provide and enhance its equipment. However, we must make that judgment call. We must distinguish between what is possible for a limited number and what will not, for a variety of reasons, be possible for the rest. It is a difficult question to answer. We cannot foresee now how exactly this will develop, but I am open to ideas and suggestions about what can be done.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_558">It required a change of legislation prior to the expedition to Somalia in 1993 to facilitate an engagement of that kind. This is not something that can be pre-judged. It depends on the options, what one is asked and expected to do, the nature of the crisis, the part of the world, and what the reconnaissance people say about it. I do not want to judge any of that. I said it would happen in the life-time of this Government. It is certainly a couple of years away yet.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_561">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 81 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I am aware of the statements made by PDFORRA in relation to its concerns regarding the deployment of ships engineering staff. The position is that the level of operational activity of naval vessels has been reasonably consistent in recent years with each vessel being away from the naval base for an average of 161 days in 2000 and 2001 and an average of 170 days in 2002. I expect that the level of activity in 2003 will be in keeping with recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">PDFORRA has raised concerns about two particular groups, engine room artificers and electrical artificers. The position with engine room artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 76 to 85 following the reorganisation of the Naval Service arising from the White Paper on Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">A total of 70 engine room artificers are serving at present and a further nine will complete their naval training later this year. The situation will continue to improve as significant numbers of trainee engine room artificers complete their training and come on stream over the next four years. In addition to the nine I have already mentioned, a further 29 apprentices-trainee technicians are currently at various stages in the training process. They will all come on stream over the next four years and will both meet the current shortfall and replace any further wastage that may occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The position with electrical artificers is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased from 42 to 48 following the reorganisation of the Naval Service. A total of 32 are serving at present. A further 24 are currently in training of which three will qualify and become operational later this year. The balance are at various stages in the training process and will come on stream in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that when fully implemented all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore based appointment followed by a ship based appointment. In this regard, I should point out that two years in a ship based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">While the increase in the number of appointments for both engine room artificers and electrical artificers may have created some short-term difficulties, I am assured by the military authorities that the arrangements in place to provide suitably trained and qualified personnel will see an early improvement in the situation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_568">What response has the Minister made to the concerns expressed by PDFORRA on this issue? Does he accept that expecting people to spend such long periods at sea can lead to unacceptable levels of stress?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_569">I do not know how to answer this question. There are many jobs which involve unacceptable levels of stress at times. One example is the stress Deputies put me under from time to time. As I have outlined, there are short-term problems which are being remedied by the numbers of people being trained. In spite of that, the number of days at sea has increased in recent years and we still had a ship doing virtual commercial work for us in Hong Kong for St. Patrick's day in 2002 and in Savannah and Miami this year. There were also other expeditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I am not saying there are no areas where there is not excessive stress from time to time. That is part of life. There is no Utopia where everything is in apple-pie order every day for everyone. There is no point in pretending otherwise. We depend on the capacity, ingenuity and commitment of people to manage situations during difficult periods until we are in smooth waters once again. That is what is happening without undue stress. The Naval Service has been doing extraordinarily well.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_571">Would the Minister agree this is a vicious circle? Would he agree that during the past five years, from 1996 to 2001-02, 43 mechanics and engineers left the Naval Service, many because they were suffering from work-related stress directly as a result, they maintain, of the fact that they are obliged to spend two years out of every three in service at sea. They claim that the ideal objective is a ratio of two to two. Negotiations are going on at present between PDFORRA, the representative body, and the Department. Will the Minister indicate whether there is any chance of going back to the original situation where the ratio was two to two?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_572">There is no chance of that. I have looked at the international statistics in this area. This was examined in the context of the White Paper on the reorganisation of the naval service, the service plan, investment in the ships and galleys and other improvements. In recent years in various areas and professions a number of people have opted for alternative job opportunities, pay sometimes being the decider as it has slowed down considerably in recent times. That is something one has to live with.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">People with special expertise are offered other opportunities. I have met many people in the Naval Service in the past number of years and they appear to have excellent morale. We have purchased the <i>LE Niamh</i> and the <i>LE Róisín</i> and improved facilities in general. I have received many complimentary reports from abroad about the Naval Service and there is no cause for alarm whatsoever.</p>

Is it true that as a result of a recent change in regulations, if a person wishes to transfer from the Naval Service to the Army he or she must first resign from the Naval Service and re-enlist at the bottom of the ladder?

      the progress made to date by the independent monitoring group recommended in the report of the external advisory committee on the Defence Forces dealing with allegations of bullying and sexual harassment within the Defence Forces; when it is expected that the implementation plan on the reforms recommended will be put in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [8935/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_580">Dr. Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report to me in March 2002. I accepted the report in full together with all of its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The following action has been taken on foot of the recommendations of the report. An independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle has been established to oversee the implementation of the fundamental reforms which the report recommended. The monitoring group is meeting regularly to formulate proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations. The most significant development is the genuine and growing collaboration between the military authorities, the two representative associations and the Department of Defence in relation to implementing the recommendations. The first stage of disseminating the findings of the report has taken place. A number of focus groups have been set up by the group to identify appropriate ways of enriching training at all levels in the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">An equality steering group has been established and is meeting regularly. Since its first meeting in September 2002, the equality steering group has been engaged in an equality audit of various Defence Forces regulations and instructions. The group is examining a range of matters including the legislation, regulations and administrative instructions, practices and procedures under which the Defence Forces operate. This examination is to take into account the current legislative requirements, best practice in employment in Ireland, the particular requirements of the military environment and the Challenge of the Workplace report. The equality steering group will ensure that progress is made both in relation to legislative requirements and best working practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The monitoring group has recently appointed a private specialist body to provide the recommended independent confidential help line and counselling service. This body will provide a 24-hour freephone care line to all serving members of the Defence Forces. A counsellor will be available to answer the care line 24 hours a day for 365 days of the year. If a caller wants telephone help only, that is provided. More structured help from a counsellor is provided as necessary and at a time and venue to suit the user. The monitoring group plans to review the service after six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The monitoring group has also recently appointed an independent body to design, distribute, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire for Defence Forces personnel. A questionnaire will be tested in a pilot phase before being administered to approximately 300 personnel who are leaving the Defence Forces. Exit interviews will be part of the process and a comprehensive report will be presented to the monitoring group. Total confidentiality is assured in relation to any individual member of the Defence Forces who participates in the work of the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Agreement was reached in January 2003 on a new administrative instruction A7 on interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces, which sets out policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships, including negative workplace behaviours such as bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment. This new administrative instruction has been brought into line with workplace legislation. However, no document will of itself promote trust in the organisation and the need for a parallel structure remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"><i>Additional information</i>The monitoring group agreed on the importance of training for those who will implement the revised procedures, and within the associations which have a crucial role in representation of their members. The success of the new administrative instruction as a formal structure for dealing with complaints will depend on the people who interpret and implement it. Training in human resource management is crucial. The military authorities have engaged an associate of IBEC to provide initial training on a pilot basis for commanders and senior NCOs. The focus of the training is to be the prevention and resolution of interpersonal conflict aspects that the monitoring group had previously identified as important in organisational change and development. The monitoring group will review this pilot work.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The monitoring group has agreed that the informal approach to dealing with bullying issues should include contact persons with appropriate support skills. The most appropriate way of identifying and training the contact persons is now being considered.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_589">We do not make that information available. Suffice to say that we regarded the complaints as a significant warning of something fundamentally wrong which needed to be addressed. There is no place for bullying in training or anywhere else in the country. We have taken very serious steps to address the issue. Dr. Doyle has had co-operation from the military hierarchy and support from my Department. It is heartening to see the reaction of the Defence Forces as a whole to this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I was delighted that my Department was approached by another organisation who wished to know the steps that had been taken because we seemed to be leaders in our approach to this problem. I am not anxious to be leading in this area; I like to see the Department taking a lead in finding remedies for problems but not necessarily as a leader in the area of high numbers of cases of bullying and harassment. I do not wish to see people leave the Defence Forces or be subject to that kind of treatment in their daily work. We will do our best to eliminate it.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_595">The proposed legislation to institute an office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces will be passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas by the summer. We are addressing some problems of agreement with the association and that is well advanced at this stage and I am anxious to see that through.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Challenge of the Workplace report produced by Dr. Doyle and her colleagues stated the percentages and numbers. A genuine effort has been made to make the system as confidential as possible in order to encourage people to give as much information as possible about the problems they were facing without the worry of being identifiable. The number of people working together in barracks, for instance, could cause people to be inhibited. I will make the statistics in the report available to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The existing system for the redress of wrongs still stands and is always an option. Personnel may report to the chief of staff, to their commanding officer, to a chaplain or a medical officer. There are many options available. Direct access by telephone to Dr. Doyle is also available because she opened up her office and facilities on a confidential basis to people troubled in this way. A variety of ways of upward communication have been provided.</p>

People felt they wanted to change the system but as far as I am aware there has been no claim so far for financial compensation. It indicates that people genuinely want change but they are not anxious to go down the road of compensation. I will let the Deputy know if I become aware of anyone seeking compensation. However, one is talking about infinitesimal numbers as against the percentage of original complaints.</p>

If the Deputy took note of defence spending in recent years he would be complimenting me on the extent to which I found resources, which no previous Government could find, to improve Defence Forces equipment without asking taxpayers for an extra penny.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">This is a document, not a Community decision. Some people have views on the issue because they see to what extent Europe's total expenditure is probably as high as America on the whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">When one adds up the whole lot and puts the percentages together, as far as all the equipment is concerned, there is a wide difference. Some people have ideas about that. As far as the Government is concerned, it makes up its own mind. It decides on the allocation to the Defence Forces and it will not be dictated to by anyone in regard to what it should or should not spend. There has been no pressure on me as Minister for Defence, at Council level or elsewhere, to do what the Deputy is asking. He can be assured that I will not let him wake up some morning, even if he wants to believe it himself, so that he can make political gains out of my stupidity or someone else's stupidity. I have taken action in the Department of Defence to safeguard the funds for education and health by raising resources from our property profile. I will continue to do so to the Deputy's consternation.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy F. McGrath – the plight of the Palestinian people and the urgent need for more international attention; (2) Deputy Gogarty – the need to re-open or re-assess the findings of the Scott investigation into approximately 350 incidences of alleged abuse in what is now known as St. David's in Artane and send some of the files to the DPP; (3) Deputy Donal Moynihan – the need to discuss the extreme hardship caused to pupils and staff of St. Colman's boys' national school, Macroom, County Cork, roll no. 15597W, and St. Joseph's primary school, Macroom, County Cork, roll no. 10047I, due to the decision of the Department to terminate posts allocated under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme; the applications made by these two schools under this disadvantaged programme; to outline the process of appeal; to ascertain if the up-to-date information supplied by these two schools was reviewed by the ERC; to provide details of the scoring system used, the method of calculation of the points for inclusion and the cut-off points for inclusion in the scheme; (4) Deputy Ó Caoláin – the need for the relevant State agencies to act immediately in response to the closure of the CPV plant in Clones, County Monaghan, with the loss of 85 jobs; (5) Deputy Costello – the need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain why he has failed to ensure there is sufficient funding to the Mater Hospital to maintain its full bed capacity and to prevent the proposed closure of 115 beds; (6) Deputy Naughten – the need to rescind the decision to introduce a double penalty on special beef premium applications of over 50 animals; (7) Deputy Murphy – in view of the Minister's statement in the Dáil of today, Tuesday, 1 April, stating the SPA for hen harriers should not interfere with the granting of planning permissions, whether the Government will consider extending the time limit for Aer VI in view of the fact that certain planning permissions have been held up; (8) Deputy Morgan – the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to address the findings contained in the report of the Health Research Board into adverse effects of landfill and incineration that found, first, the lack of compliance of existing incinerators with current emission regulations; second, that the EPA does not have facilities to monitor emissions and, third, the appalling record of incinerator operators who completely fail to maintain dioxin emission levels within permitted limits and the need to prohibit the development of this dirty industry in Ireland; (9) Deputy Crowe – the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to urgently address the legitimate concerns of human rights activists at the prejudicial statements made by senior Colombian military, judicial and political figures relating to the trial of three Irishmen, Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley in Colombia, and the need to clarify if the Minister agrees that these statements make it very difficult for these three Irish citizens to receive a fair trial; (10) Deputy Crawford – the urgent need to restore the CPV plant or an alternative in Clones so that the 140 workers who have now lost their jobs will have an opportunity to work in their own area; (11) Deputy Deenihan – the importance of keeping The Rice House (The Old Presbytery) in Dingle, County Kerry, in public ownership in view of its historical significance.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_612">I am pressing the amendment because of the poor record of the Government in appointing women to State boards. I indicated the number of women on numerous State boards dealing with issues in which they would be much involved such as tourism. The inequity in appointments by successive Ministers to various State boards is not justified. A recent publication by the National Women's Council of Ireland recommended that gender balance on State boards should be a statutory requirement. It recommended that it should be legally compulsory for women to make up at least 40% of each State board, which is the spirit of the amendment. Prominent women involved in the tourism industry throughout the country are supportive of this amendment. They want no more or no less than their male counterparts. All they want is fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. He has tabled an amendment which may achieve the same result. However, women do not believe what Ministers commit to because the record indicates a poor performance by Governments in this respect. They want to enshrine in legislation this requirement. France introduced a parity law in 2000 which is working well in relation to the membership of boards and the involvement of women in political organisations, etc. It is time we adopted the French model.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it has been tabled and in the interest of the thousands of women involved in the tourism industry. They are the principal driving force in many instances, including in bed and breakfast accommodation, guesthouses, hotels and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_621">Will the Minister consider this amendment given the importance of employee input into the authority? We have seen where the expertise and advice of the relevant people who comprise an authority can be supported by members of that authority or company. We have seen this with worker directors in semi-State bodies and it has been successful in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">When the Civil Defence Bill was before the House, I asked the then Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Brennan, if he would agree to insert a similar amendment in that legislation. While he did not agree to insert it, it is on record that he agreed to implement such a proposal and, in fairness to him, he did so. When the board of the Civil Defence was appointed, the then Minister of State also appointed one of the employees of the Civil Defence to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">If the Minister cannot agree to include the amendment in the legislation, will he give a commitment similar to that given by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, regarding the Civil Defence? Having employees as board members of either semi-State bodies or authorities can only be of assistance in that while they may not have the same expertise in the field, they may be valuable members of the relevant State body or authority. Given the value of this legislation which the Minister is seeking to put in place before the tourism season begins, having an employee on the authority would be of immense importance and value. I hope the Minister either gives a guarantee to the House or accepts the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I support the amendment. I tabled a similar one on Committee Stage and the Minister rejected it on that occasion. I understand that a member of the union is on the board of Bord Fáilte, that this has been the custom for some time and is probably the precedent for other ministerially appointed boards. It would be better to copperfasten this in legislation and that is why I agree with Deputy Wall. Two unions represent staff, SIPTU and the NUJ. Even if the Minister could give a commitment that a representative of one of the unions would be a member of the new board, this would satisfy workers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_409" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_625">There are many organisations that would like to be represented on the new authority and it would not be possible to legislate for all of them. It is important to point out in the first instance that there is no provision in the legislation for management to have automatic entitlement to membership of the board. That is just one example. There are other groups that might credibly argue for inclusion on the board of the new authority and who clearly will not have representation on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">This brings me to the question of the new national agreement and the Labour Relations Commission review. I do not know exactly what shape the review will take. I anticipate that consideration will be given to the question of worker directors. I know that we have had representatives of workers on commercial bodies in the past, but this is a development agency and I am not aware of any other development agency where there is provision for worker representation. That said, I am of the view that there should be representation of one kind or another for people working in an organisation such as the National Tourism Development Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In that respect the commitment which I will give to Deputy Wall is that I will seek to ensure that there is union representation on the authority. I think it best to do that outside of the framework of legislation as it will not then be prescriptive. This in turn means that nobody can suggest that the legislation is discriminatory as regards one sector or another. However, the fact that I reiterate my intention to have union representation on the authority is indicative of a response to the concerns which have been expressed by Deputies Wall and Deenihan on Committee Stage in regard to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I am glad Deputy Wall put down the amendment and that we have had the opportunity of discussing it. I hope the assurance I give him will assuage any fears he had in regard to the possibility of union representation being excluded from the authority. I look forward to constructive participation by the representative of the union on the authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">I would like to thank the Minister for his co-operation on this Bill. We had a good discussion on it. An issue I raised on Second Stage was the issue of the industrial relations process. I urge the Minister, if he wants to establish this body – I think 1 May is establishment day – to ensure that any outstanding industrial relations matters are addressed as soon as possible. I understand that no meaningful discussions have taken place to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The first organisational staff chart was rejected by the unions. Chart two has now been presented but my understanding is that no agreed talks have taken place to date. There are outstanding issues like pensions, conditions of service and so forth that need to be addressed. I just point these out to the Minister to be helpful. It is important that this body be put in place for the sake of the industry. Due to the challenges facing the industry at this time there should be no long drawn out process such as there was with the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited where it took 100 hours of negotiation. To ensure this does not happen in this case, I urge the Minister to see that meaningful negotiations start as soon as possible including management and union representatives.</p>

I also take the opportunity of thanking them for their co-operation and input into this important legislation. I have indicated that it is my intention to appoint Mr. Seán Quinn, chief executive designate, as chief executive of the National Tourism Development Authority on establishment day. We already have an interim board in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I am glad to say that I again met the union representatives in recent weeks. I am also pleased to say that negotiations with the unions are taking place in order to finalise as much detail as possible prior to establishment day. It may not be possible to clear up all aspects but I sincerely hope that we move a long way towards doing so. A facilitator has also been appointed and this will be helpful in reaching a satisfactory resolution of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">May I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate CERT on its performance over the years in the services sector on behalf of young people. I thank CERT for its wonderful contribution to the Irish tourism product. In that context it would be remiss of me if I did not, on this historic occasion, also take the opportunity of acknowledging the outstanding effort of Bord Fáilte in the development of the Irish tourism product over so many years. The men and women who served on the board and those who worked for it are owed a deep debt of gratitude by the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Bord Fáilte's contribution to the development of Irish tourism down through the decades, in good times and bad, is something which every true blooded Irish man and woman would wish to acknowledge. From extremely small beginnings it succeeded in building up and marketing a tourism product in this country to the extent that both the product and the marketing strategy became the envy of many governments across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">It is important to record that Bord Fáilte succeeded where few other Irish semi-State companies did. It succeeded in growing the industry to be one of the biggest in the State. Today the revenue it generates for the economy amounts to €4.3 billion making it, certainly, one of the largest industries we have. Its vibrancy, growth, resilience and confidence are due to the work of the men and women in Bord Fáilte whom I would like to salute this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I was going through the Law Society's business law and technology committee. I do not think the issue I am about to raise was dealt with on Committee Stage. It has to do with the right of access and the Sex Offenders Act 2001. An organisation such as the ISPCC requires employees to seek their personal files from the Garda Síochána under the Data Protection Act. This is a backdoor system for the organisation to get information about these individuals. Once section 5 is enacted the ISPCC would be committing an offence if it asked a potential employee to make an access request. The response from the Department over the past year has been that this is dealt with under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 but the Law Society has raised some questions about that. Ultimately it is asking for a review of both laws to see how they meld together.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 it is an offence for a sex offender to apply for a job that involves unsupervised access to a child or other vulnerable person without informing the employer that he or she is a sex offender. The employers cannot ask for this information. The onus is on the sex offender to supply that information. There is a difference. Perhaps the Minister of State would comment on that. It is an issue that should be raised with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">What will happen is that an organisation such as the ISPCC will have to go to the Garda in the locality for an informal vet and ask about a particular individual. However, there is no formal process to ascertain the background of that individual who could end up working with young children. This is a serious issue so far as that is concerned. The Law Society suggests there is no clarity as it pertains to the Sex Offenders Act and the Data Protection Bill as it stands, and there may be some outstanding questions that need to be looked at under a review.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The Law Society says that the Sex Offenders Act also requires sex offenders to notify the Garda with relevant information such as their names and addresses. It is unclear how these requirements will interact with the Data Protection Bill on issues such as how long the Garda can retain this information and the conditions under which gardaí involved in other criminal investigations can access information notified to the Garda under the Sex Offenders Act 2001. The Law Society asks that a review be undertaken of how the Data Protection Bill will integrate with the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Last year the director of the ISPCC asked for a three step approach with regard to the vetting process: an extension of vetting procedures to all organisations working with children; enforcement of such procedures on a statutory basis and the creation of new vetting systems which complemented Garda clearance checks. The Minister of State understands from where I am coming on this issue.</p>

My advice is as follows: the issue of enforced access in the context of employment where the potential employer requires the job applicant to make an access request to his or her former employer has been the subject of considerable discussion and we have discussed it at some length on Committee Stage. Some people consider it may interfere with existing practice in relation to clearance for certain jobs in the voluntary and other sectors.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_664">Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, which were tabled on Committee Stage and submitted on Report Stage were discussed at considerable length. The definition of "indoor event" as set out in section 2, when taken together with the prescribed classes of indoor event requiring a licence under section 5(1) which will be prescribed in the proposed regulations, will clearly identify those indoor events which fall within the scope of the licensing system. I have serious concerns that the amendments will both restrict the type of event to be regulated and lead to the Minister being approached by promoters seeking exemptions to narrow the scope of the regulations further.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">As public safety is paramount there can be little justification in removing certain performances prior to setting number thresholds for such events for which powers are provided under section 5, which will, of itself, rule out many performances. The original purpose of the definition of "other events" in line 9 is to enable the Minister to prescribe other classes of events, such as large scale indoor sporting events, seminars, conferences or exhibitions such as the young scientists exhibition or ideal homes exhibitions. The amendments proposed would result in the licensing system being restricted only to musical, singing or dancing performances as given in the definition of indoor events.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Parliamentary counsel has stressed that the entire structuring of the licensing Bill and regulations has been focused on providing for the prescribing of certain classes of indoor events which will require a licence and to provide for a licensing system for large scale indoor events. The system is not designed to exclude individual events, as safety considerations must apply to all such events. To try to include this amendment could lead to serious difficulties with the legal basis and structure of the Bill as drafted or could lead to the Minister being approached on a regular basis to amend the regulations to facilitate the exemption of certain events from the requirements of the licensing system. This was not the intention of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The note circulated to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government on the proposed regulations has clarified the thresholds of 1,000 plus for adult audiences and 750 plus for child audiences. While all such events will require a licence, fees will only apply to events being held for profit or gain and may be waived or reduced at the discretion of the fire authority. Accordingly, the new licensing obligations are not so onerous or costly as to require the removal of some events from the licensing requirements designed for all such events to ensure public safety. For those reasons, I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3<i>a.</i>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_670">Thank you for that clarification. I welcome this Bill. It is a move in the right direction and is overdue. Nevertheless, some aspects need to be amended. This is particularly true with regard to amendment No. 2<i>a,</i> which deals with the costs incurred in administering the measures of the Bill. The Bill requires that the administration be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas. I fail to see why the hard-pressed taxpayer should subsidise events featuring multi-millionaire performers such as Paul McCartney or U2, or equally wealthy promoters such as Wonderland or MCD. This amendment provides for levies to be applied to such wealthy promoters and not to the beleaguered taxpayer. I thought this a reasonable proposal and hoped the amendment would be accepted. I trust that multi-millionaire promoters are not in the same category as the stud farm owners of Kildare. Perhaps the Minister will demonstrate this by accepting this amendment so that these very wealthy people will bear the cost of administering this Bill when enacted. We can see from their lifestyles that they are not short of a few bob and could pay the levy, especially as they are making millions from Irish citizens every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Amendment No. 3<i>a</i> places the responsibility for providing a safe environment on the managers of the facilities in which events are held and on their security personnel. We know from ongoing court actions that individual bouncers have been wayward on occasion. I am aware that regulation to deal with this problem is on its way but this amendment seeks to include as many of the salient issues as possible together in one Act and in doing so make it easier for promoters, entertainers and facility management to understand their responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Amendment No. 3<i>a </i>also deals with the rights of customers and audiences. People are entitled to have a clear understanding of the responsibilities of the promoters, facility management and security personnel. That is the primary aim of these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The amendments also propose a small number of technical changes. I hope the Minister will consider the thinking behind these amendments. They do not claim ownership of the Bill. My purpose is to spread the burden evenly and fairly among those who can most afford it.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I seek clarification from the Minister of State on a couple of small points relevant to the amendments we are discussing. The Minister of State referred to "a performance which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and comprises music, singing, dancing and displays of entertainment or any similar activity in respect of which members of the public may or may not attend". Would the performance include any or all of those activities or must it consist of a combination of all of them?</p>
          <p eId="para_675">In Galway city, for example, a novena is held in the cathedral every year. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people attend each session, of which there are several every day and there is music and singing at each session, although very little dancing. Would this event require a licence and would it be subject to a fee? A collection is taken up at the novena but it is not a money-making event. Would the organisers of the novena be subject to the licensing system?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I am also concerned about the timescale of getting a licence. What happens when events have to be arranged very quickly? What if, for example, the Dáil collapsed and candidate selection conventions had to be arranged suddenly? There are several areas where 1,000 people might attend a convention. What would happen in such a case? How is the time limit to be overcome if an event has to be organised at very short notice? Would such an event be subject to a licence fee?</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_679">The provision set out in amendment 3<i>a</i> by Deputy Morgan has been specified in a more powerful manner in the Bill. I refer Deputy Morgan to section 10 of the primary legislation. This area does not rely on regulation under the Bill. The protection of attendees, their health, safety and welfare at indoor events is embedded in the procedures of the licensing system under the application procedures for the licence and the statutory duties of care of the event organiser, which is set out, as I already said, in section 10.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The licensing system we have developed in this Bill creates a culture for the protection of those attending indoor events. The purpose of the licensing system set out in the Bill is to ensure the safety of crowds of people who attend indoor events to be licensed under the Bill and to provide for a safe environment for attendees. There is also a statutory duty on the licensor – the fire authorities – in considering applications for licensing to ensure that these issues are provided for in the applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">In regard to the expenses, this section is a standard provision dealing with expenses that might be incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill as in section 7 of the Fire Services Act 1981 or section 242 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. It is not expected that the Minister will incur any significant expenses in regard to the Bill or the regulations to be made under it. The licensing system that is proposed will be self-financing with both application fees for licences provided for in section 5(9)(<i>d</i>) of the Bill and fines payable under the penalty provisions of the Bill provided for in sections 18(1) and (2) being payable to the fire authorities. On summary conviction, fines of up to €3,000 and on conviction on indictment fines of up to €1.3 million are provided for. Some administrative expenses will arise for the Minister and the Department in regard to the organisation or information seminars and workshops for fire authority personnel on the regulations of the new licensing system. Some costs will also be involved in the preparation and publishing of information and guidance for fire authorities on the provisions of the Bill, any new codes of practice developed under section 27 of the Bill and the operation of the licensing system under regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I regret that I am unable to accept any of the amendments. In regard to Deputy McCormack's point about one or more event, I refer him to section 5(6)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill, which states that the fire authority may:</p>
          <p eId="para_683">grant the licence authorising the holding, in a specified building on a specified date or dates, of an indoor event or a specified number of indoor events and may attach one or more conditions to the licence as the fire authority thinks fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">It can be one or more event. In regard to the question about conventions, I hope we will not be thinking of that for a number of years.</p>

          <p eId="para_693">Another point raised by Deputy McCormack, which was also raised on Committee Stage, was in regard to religious service events. This could be an issue as a great number of people could be accommodated in Galway cathedral, for instance. I will repeat the definition of "indoor event" as it appears in the Bill. It is defined as:</p>
          <p eId="para_694">(<i>a</i>)  a performance which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and comprises music, singing, dancing, displays of entertainment or any similar activity and in respect of which members of the public may or may not attend, or</p>
          <p eId="para_695">(<i>b</i>) an event which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and is prescribed under <i>section 4 (2</i>),</p>
          <p eId="para_696">other than an event to which Part XVI of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">It is the view of the Department and that of the Parliamentary Counsel that religious-type services do not fall within the definition of "indoor event" in section 2. Religious services do not fall within the definition as a performance, nor is it the intention to prescribe them by way of regulation. I wish to give that assurance to the Deputy and the House. If the Minister considers at some future date that such services should be licensed, he may prescribe in regulation that religious services above a particular threshold shall require a licence but we do not foresee that arising.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">It is exactly 14 years ago since the Hillsborough disaster, following which, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton was asked to inquire into all aspects of crowd safety and crowd control. His group first met in May 1989 and its terms of reference were to look at all events where crowds would gather such as major sporting events, open-air and indoor concerts, indoor events and major race meetings. It was to look at over-crowding, fire safety and prevention, structural standards and the physical layout of the venue. The Hamilton report made 73 key recommendations, many of which were related to indoor events such as pop concerts where the anticipated attendance would exceed 2,000, which was one of the parameters of the inquiry. He recommended that all such events be licensed on an individual basis by the District Court and that a minimum of two months notice be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Despite the fact that the committee reported in February 1990, it was October 1996 before any action was taken on that report when the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, addressed the issue and set up a working group chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The code of practice prepared by that group was published in 1998 and came under 13 headings. I cannot understand why it has taken a further five years for the legislation to reach this point. It is hard to credit the snail's pace at which such an important issue with implications for public safety was conducted.</p>

This Bill adds yet another layer to the system of permits needed to occupy a building. I am not convinced that we should proceed with this Bill, and I ask why we are introducing another layer of bureaucracy when we cannot even implement the rules and regulations already in place.

          <p eId="para_713">I impress upon the Minister of State that we are dealing here with something of a very serious nature, and the amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore were designed to improve the Bill and ensure that it is specific. They were not put down simply as a mechanism to oppose the Government or because we are in Opposition. The Bill already is specific, but the amendments are designed to achieve clarity, to avoid the degree of over-regulation about which Deputy Cuffe spoke and to ensure the safety of people at events, whether they are there as performers or consumers. It is regrettable that the Minister of State is not prepared to take any of the amendments on board, although I accept that Amendment No. 2<i>a</i> is out of order.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">That is what I seek clarification on. The Bill says explicitly that moneys will be made available by the Minister for Finance, but it does not state who sets the levies. Is it local authorities or the Minister? Are the levies collected by local authorities or by an officer acting on behalf of the Minister? I tabled this amendment as I would appreciate clarification from the Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_717">The Bill states that it is possible to submit an application for a multi-licence for a premises. If a licence had to be applied for in the case of every event, the cost would be astronomical and prohibitive, so the multi-licence will cover events such as conventions. The fire authorities have 28 days in which to issue a decision after the receipt of a valid application. Section 6(1) provides, however, that such decisions will be taken as soon as practicable. Decisions will be issued as soon as an evaluation has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Some Deputies have suggested that the Bill creates another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. I do not agree. These matters may appear to be covered by a plethora of existing legislative provisions, such as the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2001, the Fire Services Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990 and the Public Dance Halls Act 1935. I agree with Deputy Allen, however, that this Bill has been around for a long time, and I appreciate the cross-party support to ensure that the Bill is enacted and put into effect as quickly as possible. The Bill arises from the need to implement an outstanding recommendation of the Hamilton committee on crowd control at indoor concerts dating back to 1991. The development of the 1998 code of practice for safety at indoor events and The Review of Public Safety Order 2000 indicated that existing licensing systems governing such events did not adequately cater for matters such as public safety. We all would agree that public safety, crowd management and regulatory support for the codes of practice are absolutely essential. We must ensure that this Bill is enacted as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">To answer Deputy Morgan's question, the new arrangements will be self financing. We will go into the issue of fees later. I gave an assurance to Deputies on Committee Stage that we would offer a very clear indication of what the thresholds and application fees would be. Section 5(10)(<i>d</i>) provides for the prescription of charges. There was reference to a charge on the Minister, and that is common practice and is provided for in all Bills. We do not foresee any major cost implications and are pleased to provide whatever little is necessary for seminars and provision of information by way of pamphlets and leaflets. Apart from that there will be no other charge on the Exchequer.</p>

Will they cover entrance and exit locations, first aid rooms and door openings? Will promoters and venues post notices in regard to special needs for the disabled, the elderly and children who may attend? Will they post details about prohibited items, crowd activities and penalties? To the amusement of some, I went into the detail of those during the Second Stage debate. Will there be advice on updates and performance schedule changes if changes are made? Will it be obligatory to give information and maps in regard to emergency situations? Will there be regulations covering sound and noise levels inside the concert site? Will the promoters have to report first aid data and arrest information so that music fans, if it is a music event, parents, medical professionals, crowd safety consultants, safety and law enforcement officials and legislators will be able to better judge the safety of events in their communities? Will the regulations drafted help the event organisers, artists and contract staff to offer a safe environment?</p>
          <p eId="para_730">As we know, much of the concert scene is greatly influenced by international trends. Will there be ongoing monitoring of the international concert industry in terms of new trends in music performance and musical acts? What assurance do we have that the regulations will keep up to date with the inevitable changing tastes in music and in crowd behaviour? I am seeking an assurance that the codes of practice and the regulations stemming from this legislation will recognise the international influence and the changes which will result from that influence on performances, performers, organisers and audiences.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_464">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_731">This is a common sense amendment not only in relation to this Bill but to many others. I am always very conscious of ministerial regulations, no matter who is the Minister or what party he or she is from. When we pass legislation, which is our duty as legislators, we seem to have no control over ministerial regulations which may be introduced as a result of a Bill being passed. Where the Minister intends to bring forward regulations even if they meet with the approval of everybody, it is important that they are brought before the House for a certain period of time so that Members could familiarise themselves with them. Sometimes when regulations are introduced by a Minister, members of the public think they are part of a Bill which Members of the Oireachtas have passed. Although we may give a Minister the authority to introduce regulations by passing a Bill, we have no say when they those regulations are introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">This would be a common sense approach to adopt in that the amendment states that regulations may not be made unless a draft has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas after an expiry period of three months. I do not know whether three months is the right period of time – perhaps a shorter period, a month or two months, might do. It is important that Members of the House have an opportunity to digest and investigate any proposed ministerial regulations before they are made.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_465">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_733">I am sure the Minister and his staff will find somebody to take on the onerous task of deciding on the emerging tastes in music and look forward to their publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> On a more serious note, I am concerned at the web of bureaucracy being added to permitting events to take place. This Kafka-esque web will strangle initiative and will require a layer of bureaucracy which will impose an undue burden on us all. If the Minister sincerely believes this Bill is a good one, he would at least repeal some of the rather primitive legislation on the Statute Book – for example, the public dancing and singing Acts which date back to the 1930s. Surely, if we are trying to bring in a new Bill, we should at least get rid of some of the detritus which still imposes a burden on concert promoters and on us as concert goers. If we are reviewing this area, I would like to see a much more comprehensive review.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The planning system, which has an adjunct licensing system, has recently been reviewed. We have a building control system which has a very specific system of fire control. We also have the liquor licensing legislation. My worry about all these layers of legislation is that there is very little attempt to bring them together. Most of the civil servants implementing the legislation are not looking to see what the other branches of a particular body are doing. I know from my experience on Dublin City Council as a councillor for ten years that there is not enough liaison between the different branches implementing the law. A simple requirement, which is in place abroad, is that the maximum capacity of a venue is displayed on the wall of the venue. That would go a long way towards improving safety at indoor events. If people knew the maximum capacity when walking into a pub, concert or church and to whom to make a complaint, the public safety at indoor events would increase. I am concerned about this and think a few common sense proposals would go a long way.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I am also concerned about the exemption with regard to religious events. This is either a good Bill or it is not and to allow a significant dispensation for religious events is not a good thing. From my limited experience of religious events, a huge number of candles are used at some services causing a significant threat to public safety. We must have a comprehensive system of regulation that does not favour or discriminate against particular ceremonies. I am nervous of the way in which this legislation is drafted, giving various exemptions to political and religious organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Good amendments have been put forward but I query the nature of the Bill. We should reconsider some of the elderly statutes on the books rather than adding another layer to an already complex system of legislation, regulations, and standards.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_466" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_737">This amendment, originally tabled by Deputy Gilmore, is ostensibly about the three month period versus 21 days. When this amendment was debated on Committee Stage, Deputies requested that a briefing note be circulated to the members of the select committee prior to Report Stage to inform them of what the Minister proposes to include in the regulations. I agreed that this would be arranged. The briefing note was circulated and provides information on the draft regulations dealing with the main issues of concern to Deputies and is intended to clarify the Minister's intentions, particularly with regard to setting the threshold numbers for the licensing requirement for indoor events and the proposed licence application fees to be set in the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">To deal with thresholds, the regulations will provide that a licence will be required under section 5 of the Act for an indoor event as defined in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act, which will be prescribed under section 5(2), and at which the audience exceeds 1,000 people where the audience profile is mainly adult, or at which the audience exceeds 750 people where the audience profile is mainly children under 16 years of age. A licence will also be required for an indoor event which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and is prescribed under section 4(2) of the Act by the Minister as follows: indoor sports events where the audience exceeds 1,000 people, conferences, conventions, seminars, exhibitions, trade shows and fairs where the audience exceeds 2,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">With regard to licence application fees, which were discussed at length, the proposed one-off application fee in respect of an indoor event being held mainly for profit or gain is €1,000. Many events will attract multi-licence applications and that has been taken into consideration. The proposed application fee in respect of a multi-licence for any number of similar events in a year for profit is €1,500. In addition, the fire authority will also have absolute discretion to refund all or part of the fee payable in respect of a particular application where it is satisfied that the payment in full of the fee would not be appropriate and I have made explicit provision for varying the fee under amendment No. 10 which I propose to move later in this debate. This decision will be taken with regard to the nature, extent or purpose of the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The scale of application fees has been set in consultation with fire authorities to ensure that they will be self-financing while not being levied on charitable events, school concerts or similar events. The fee provisions are similar to those included in the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations, 2001. The Minister will also issue guidance to the fire authorities on the interpretation and application of the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Indoor events with an audience below the threshold number specified in the regulations as requiring a licence will continue to be regulated under relevant legislative provisions such as the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Fire Services Act, 1981 and related codes of practice, the Building Control Act, 1990 and building regulations, and any other licensing controls which apply such as an annual dance licence, liquor licence or music and singing licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">As I pointed out on Committee Stage, if this amendment was to be accepted, instead of dealing with what may be immediate public safety issues with possible consequences for large numbers attending events, a period of three months would have to pass and Dáil and Seanad time be given before the matters could be dealt with in regulations or such regulations be amended. The Bill proposes a standard provision of regulations laid before the House for a period of 21 days and Deputies are still afforded an opportunity within that 21 days to annul any proposed regulation. A period of 21 days is, by and large, the norm and should be sufficient to give an opportunity for the House to annul such a provision. The existing range of legislation and regulation, which under section 7 also applies to such events, should reassure Deputies that positive regulation by the Houses would not be required in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Deputy Allen referred to posting of notices and the general information that should be made available in section 5(7). This is to ensure that information about the licence is displayed by the holder of an indoor event to persons attending the event. It will also assist the authorised officer when inspecting an event. These notices will be in a format required by the fire authority and will be displayed at each entrance to the indoor event. Anyone attending the event will be able to see at a glance that a licence exists as well as the important details pertaining to the licence such as the maximum attendance, the layout of the building, emergency assistance information and public liability insurance. Any authorised officer visiting the building will be aware from his or her records that a licence exists, but having the notice displayed will assist the officer in giving instant access to details which he or she can inspect on the spot.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Deputy Cuffe referred to religious events, and that issue, I hope, was adequately dealt with in the debate. I hope Deputy Lynch will consider withdrawing the amendment. A period of 21 days is more than adequate and is the norm.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I note the Minister is concerned with the public safety aspect of not accepting this amendment in that a regulation might have to be quickly introduced. I seek further clarification on the meaning of the 21 day period. Can the House annul a regulation the Minister would propose to introduce? This Bill is slightly different in that public safety is at issue and a quick decision might have to be made with regard to a regulation. I am concerned that a Minister can make a regulation, where it is provided for in the legislation, without the Members of the House having an ample opportunity to examine or discuss it. I am sorry Deputy Cuffe has left the House.</p>

This legislation will not mean that they have to get a licence.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">My amendment proposes the substitution of the word "holding" with the phrase "any place in which it is proposed from time to time to hold". It seeks to attach the licence to the location rather than to the event. There was extensive discussion of this on Committee Stage and it is not my intention to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> the argument that was made then. We had a long discussion on this on Committee Stage and I do not want to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> the entire argument that was made at that stage. Essentially the Bill proposes the licensing of events, which means that each individual event or each class of event will have to be licensed, and the duration of the licence will be 12 months. Venues such as the Point Theatre or the RDS would have to apply separately to the fire authority for a licence for each individual event or each class of event held at those venues. That seems quite unnecessary. If the venue itself is found to be suitable from the point of view of fire or crowd control, the location of the exits and all of the various items which would be examined by a fire officer for a particular type of event, then it should not be necessary to apply separately for each individual event. It should be possible to attach the licence to the venue. Obviously there would need to be regulations and restrictions on that. For example, a venue might be licensed to hold 750 for events targeted at people under 16, 1,000 for music events or concerts, and 2,000 for conferences. Given those parameters, it should be possible to licence a venue for those events with those conditions attached to the licence, rather than requiring a separate application for each individual event, taking up the time and resources of the fire authority in having to licence each event and having to renew those licences every year. The mechanism I propose would ensure the same degree of attention was given to public safety and the issues attaching thereto, while reducing the amount of bureaucracy and time, and reducing the commitment of resources which would be necessary. It would also enable event organisers to plan better on a longer term basis. I will come back to an argument I made on Committee Stage that the requirement to apply each year for a licence means that events which have to be arranged more than a year in advance would be somewhat at risk or certainly in some doubt if they have to renew the licence after the one year period.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_761">There is great merit in this amendment because if a venue is licensed it has to meet the standard required for safety. If a licence on a venue has to be renewed every year, the venue will have to be examined every year. If the venue meets the fire and other safety regulations in terms of emergency doors, lighting and whatever else is required to obtain the necessary certificate of safety, it would make sense to eliminate the tremendous amount of bureaucracy attached to having to apply separately for a licence for events at a venue that is meeting all the safety requirements just as this venue does; every time there is an event here, every time the Dáil comes back we do not have to get a new licence. If several events are held during the year in a venue, provided the venue meets the required standard of safety it should be satisfactory to have one licence rather than having a licence for every class of event that takes place in that venue. I would like the Minister to consider this amendment, which is a very reasonable one. I can see no loopholes in it. The only exception would be if there was an extraordinary change in the type of event taking place at the venue. If, for example, it was proposed to have a football match in a concert hall, that would be something entirely different. However, once the same type of use is envisaged for the period of the licence it should not be necessary to have a licence for each and every event in a venue that meets all the necessary safety requirements.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_762">The Licensing Bill is designed to licence an indoor event in relation to the safety and crowd control issues surrounding the event. The system has been developed to implement the Hamilton committee report recommendation in relation to crowd control and safety issues at large-scale indoor events at which 2,000 or more people are in attendance. The Bill arises from the need to implement the outstanding recommendation of the Hamilton report.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">As I pointed out during the debate on Committee Stage, on these amendments the Bill is concerned only with crowd control and safety issues surrounding the holding of such large-scale indoor events. It is considered that venues would already have planning permission to carry out indoor events and would only require a licence when an event of the scale requiring a licence is being processed. Venues are already covered by a multiplicity of laws, including the Fire Services Act, the Building Control Act and other legislative requirements such as the Public Dance Halls Act of 1935 and the Hamilton committee considered that the smaller events and venues were already well regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The aim of this Bill is to ensure in respect of the larger type of indoor event that the promoter is made responsible in law for the safe running of the proposed event. In order to satisfy the fire authority that the proposed indoor event could take place safely, the operator would in any event have to supply documents, including lay-out plans and safety management plans, in order that the fire authority can be assured that the operator could run the proposed event safely. This is what the licensing system requires, and for the fire authority to make a judgment call on the safe holding of any proposed event in the absence of the licensing process would in our view be unacceptable where public safety is at stake. It would also leave the fire authority open to approaches from both well-meaning charity fund raisers and unscrupulous promoters to approve events, and if a tragedy were to occur at such an event permitted by the fire authority, the authority would be in an extremely vulnerable position. It would involve a fundamental shift of responsibility from the promoter or the operator onto the fire authority. The net effect would be to delay the licensing procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Minister proposes to provide in regulation that the fire authority would have discretion to refund all or part of the fee, as appropriate, while checking out the event's safety under the licensing procedure. There is general acceptance of the principle of this Bill. We are all concerned with the safety and crowd control management plan, not the venue. I take Deputy Gilmore's point about having to apply for different types of events. In terms of the Point Theatre, for example, the application is for similar types of events. We do not envisage it having to apply for each individual one. Deputy Gilmore raised this on Committee Stage. He wanted some indication of the regulations and these were circulated to members of the select committee. We have given a very clear indication of what the regulations will be. From the financial perspective, it will cost €1,000 for a single application. The fee for a multiple application for venues such as The Point and others will be €1,500. We can deal with the two year application when discussing amendment No. 9 which was tabled by the Deputy. I accept that Deputy Gilmore's amendment was tabled in all good faith in an effort to reduce the bureaucratic system and to lessen pressure on the fire authorities but much of the information required will already be available. This Bill is to deal with crowd control and not necessarily to legislate for the buildings.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">I do not think any of us are in disagreement about the necessity to ensure that indoor events are properly run and regulated and that fire regulations and so on are in place. I repeat a concern I have expressed earlier in the debate. I see some of the same issues arising in proposals relating to the abuse of alcohol among young people and I think we are in great danger of regulating fun, enjoyment and entertainment out of existence. This is a pretty grim country for a teenager to grow up in. There is not much organised entertainment activity that can take place. We are regulating it all out of existence. Nobody in his or her right mind would organise a youth club now with the number of regulations which must be observed and with matters such as insurance, fear of litigation and <i>in loco parentis</i> to deal with. Under this legislation anyone organising a concert or a big event will have to pay €1,000 for a licence followed by insurance costs and all the legal obligations which attend such an event.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I thank Deputy Gilmore for allowing me to intervene. He took the words out of my mouth. We are regulating business out of existence. We are becoming a police state. It is a case of more jobs for the boys and girls and more expense for the business sector or for anybody organising any kind of event. Deputy Gilmore is correct: the day has come when nobody wants to organise anything any more. If a shopkeeper puts a sign outside his shop, he will be visited by the health inspector, the council and every agent of the State including the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Our legislation is helping to create more civil servants and more jobs for the boys and the girls who are not answerable to anybody. When somebody wants to create a venue for enjoyment every obstacle possible is put in his way by the State. I agree that safety procedures and regulations should be in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">I know of small public houses who are visited by the fire officer and they are put out of business within six months as a result. The people are getting angry and they are sick and tired of being regulated. Rules and regulations are being introduced but there is nobody to implement them.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I challenge any Minister or any civil servant to ring any State agency or council office or office of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. They will be answered by an answering machine. Yesterday I got through by telephone to the health board and I was speaking to a young woman who could not get rid of me fast enough.

          <p eId="para_775">The Minister of State has been abroad in a place called Europe and I say the regulations coming from Europe are daft. We are rubber-stamping everything that comes from Europe. The people of this country are marching against war, and rightly marching for BreastCheck clinics and I foresee the business community closing down for about six months in order to bring the Government to its senses. It is impossible to operate a business. We are a police state being regulated by health boards, councils and civil servants. Most of them never provided a job for anyone else in their lives and never worked outside the public sector. Their pay cheques are always there every Friday. I remember when Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Education and the teachers took over his office because their salaries were not paid on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I was self-employed for 25 years. I did not know what I would earn from one week to the next. I was asked what I liked most about being a Member of the Dáil and I replied that I love the first of every month because the cheque comes in the post. Self-employed people never know what they will earn or what problems they will encounter. This proposed legislation will create more problems for the business sector.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_482">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_777">I thank Deputy Ring for his supportive contribution. I have a different perspective to Deputy Ring on the Bill. I am thinking of the potential customer, the person who will attend an event. I make the case that indoor entertainment aimed at young people is virtually non-existent outside of public houses. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spoken about legislation coming before the House dealing with age limits and identity cards. If we are serious about allowing for entertainment activity, fun and enjoyment for young people outside of the environment of a public house in an alcohol-free environment then we must ease up on the restrictions that are being placed on the organisation of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I referred to this example on Committee Stage. Student unions in the universities and institutes of technology are some of the biggest organisers of musical entertainment. They are often events organised at short notice, for instance, the lunch time concert on campus. Those events can very easily attract an audience of more than 1,000 adults, as defined in this legislation, and for which a licence would now have to be applied for in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">That is a ludicrous regulation. It ought to be possible to have a regime whereby a place of education such as a university or an institute of technology would simply apply to be licensed for events which would then take place on an impromptu basis. I do not see why it should involve so much red tape and bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">This legislation will give rise to either of two scenarios. People will either not bother organising events, and there will be a further reduction in indoor entertainment, particularly for young people, or, they will simply bypass the law. It will make the situation worse because events will be organised outside the loop altogether. There used to be a big ballyhoo about rave parties organised on beaches and so on. They emerged because there was no alternative. If there is not a reasonable regime for organising and running indoor entertainment, events will either sprout up illegally, probably in a much more dangerous environment, or those who would otherwise be involved in organising events in a regulated and safe way will not organise them.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">We could unwittingly encourage a type of black market for entertainment events, which will be much less safe than events which we now consider to be unsafe in the mainstream entertainment industry. Events could also be made more expensive. A regime which costs €1,000 for a licence, including insurance and various costs, will consolidate entertainment events into more expensive and commercial type events which will be less accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Perhaps one way of dealing with the matter would be to licence the venue rather than the event. From a safety point of view, it would achieve the same outcome but from the point of view of freeing up the regulatory environment, it would make it less difficult to organise indoor entertainment events.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_483" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. P. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_783">I appreciate what the Deputy said in regard to impromptu college events. While all such events will require a licence if the figures exceed 1,000 adults and 750 up to the age of 16, a fee will only apply to events being held for profit. College events may not be held for profit, therefore the question of a fee would not arise. I do not think anyone is opposed to what we are trying to do. That is a sensible aspect of the Bill. The cost may be waived at the discretion of the fire authority. Deputy Gilmore's concerns may be overcome if a college event is held impromptu. He said too much regulation and bureaucracy could have an effect on the future. This has not happened in regard to the licensing of outdoor events. Promoters and audiences have indicated that such events are better organised when licensed.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">What we are licensing is crowd safety control and crowd dynamics at particular events. Each event will require different crowd control levels, depending on whether they are rave parties, discos or whatever. These issues are not covered by issuing a general licence to a venue because there are different types of events. The fact that a fee will only be charged where an event is held for profit might allay some of Deputy Gilmore's fears. Multi-licence applications will cost an additional €500. To repeat what I said on Committee Stage, this measure will be self-financing and there will be no question of charging exorbitant fees. The Department and the experts, including the fire chiefs, believe the level the Minister will set down by way of regulation will ensure the measure is self-financing. The fire authorities may waive in its entirety the fee or part of the fee.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">This relates to the duration of the licence. The Bill proposes that a licence should last for one year. I propose that it should be valid for two years. The reason for this is that some of the larger events would probably need more than one year of a lead-in. One will not be able to book a big act one year in advance. These people arrange their schedules much further in advance. It is unreasonable to expect promoters to commit themselves to booking acts two years in advance if they can only get a licence which is valid for a year. They do not have certainty that the event can proceed within that time frame. The fear I expressed on Committee Stage, which I again repeat, is that if the validity of the licence is for just one year, the danger is that we may lose the type of event which would otherwise be part of a schedule which might be arranged more than a year in advance. For example, the tour of a major international act might need to be scheduled more than a year in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">If the promoter can only get a licence that lasts for a year, how does he make a commitment to engaging an act with the certainty that an event can proceed? I seek flexibility in this area. The amendment proposes that the period should be extended to two years. The Minister of State indicated on Committee Stage that this would be considered before Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_793">On Committee Stage I advised Deputy Gilmore that the legislation seeks to achieve a balance. I did not consider that a one year validity period for a licence would pose any difficulty, but I agreed to consider the matter further before Report Stage. The advisory committee established to assist with the preparation of the licensing of indoor events regulations was consulted further and advised that a one year period would not pose any difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The licence relates to public safety and crowd control issues for events. It is, therefore, only appropriate that it should be applied on an annual basis so that any problems arising at previous events can be identified and addressed at subsequent renewal applications. This is the norm for other licensing systems, including the outdoor events licensing, to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">On Committee Stage, some Deputies expressed concern that the one year period of validity for the licence might cause problems for events booked in a venue for some years in advance. That happens, especially where tickets go on sale some time in advance of events. However, the application can be made up to 28 days in advance of an event and, if granted, will be valid for a one year period. We envisage that the bigger venues, such as the Point Depot or the RDS, will get a multi-licence to cover similar types of gigs or events. Such multi-licences, obtained at the beginning of the year, will ensure that events will take place without difficulty. It would not be unusual for acts to be booked over a longer advance period, subject to licence. In many cases that is the norm in terms of booking a venue and ticket sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The same situation would apply to large conference centres and hotels which host a number of seminars during a year. They would also probably apply for a multi-licence at the beginning of the year to cover a number of similar events. I understand this is the norm with regard to other licensing systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, but events can be arranged within a 12 month period subject to licence. We have received no representations nor have we encountered major problems with the outdoor events system. The holding of indoor events should be similar. The advisory committee has recommended that we should adhere rigidly to the one year norm.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">Will the Minister of State be more specific? For some time I have been concerned about the cost to the public of attending some indoor events, such as pop concerts involving international stars.

          <p eId="para_803">Young people in this country are hugely exploited in this area. The prices of concerts involving international pop stars are unjust. Some of the promoters must be multi-millionaires. Not only must young people pay the huge cost in terms of admission charges, they must also pay credit card and handling charges. Some years ago Members in this House called for an investigation into the overall cost of these tickets.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I have little sympathy for promoters or arena owners who seek licences for such events because of the serious exploitation of young people in terms of the charges they must pay.

          <p eId="para_808">If events are profit making, the cost should be absorbed. I would like to think my party can organise events that would attract more than 1,000 participants. We would not be anxious to regulate this aspect of fund raising or community events. The fire authorities should be given discretionary powers to allow for exemptions or refunds. For example, if an application is submitted but will not qualify, it would be wrong for a fire authority to retain the application fee in full, although it may be necessary to retain some part of it, depending on what stage the application has reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">This is a sensible amendment as it allows the fire authorities to use their discretionary powers in this area. It would be wrong to regulate it. I hope good sense will prevail and that it will not be for the politicians but the fire authorities, the manager and his advisers to decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Deputy Allen's point about cost is another aspect. There are exorbitant costs for many people from peripheral areas travelling to events in Dublin or other areas. These costs include travel, admission and an overnight stay. I hope those who run these events for profit absorb the cost in question. In case the impression is given that each event that is held will result in an additional euro being charged to each person, I hope that many centres will integrate this on a multi-annual basis and that, <i>per capita,</i> it would be a much lower figure. We will have no control over the cost charged by promoters but perhaps they would incorporate this cost in their initial charge rather than making it an additional charge on those attending the events.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">Amendment No. 11 concerns the appeal to the District Court. Where an authority refuses to grant a licence or where there are conditions with which an applicant is unhappy, the Bill proposes a three week period within which that person can appeal to the District Court. Three weeks is a short period. I am thinking more in terms of organisers who would not necessarily be professional or commercial promoters. Someone organising an event could make an application to the fire authority and go on holidays, during which the decision of the authority could be made and the person may not return before the three weeks have elapsed. It should be borne in mind that, during that three week period, that person will presumably have to consult legal people, legal documentation will have to be prepared and the appeal made to the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I propose that this period should be extended to six weeks. While it is reasonable that it should not be open-ended, six weeks is not an unreasonable extension. While some applications must be decided upon within 28 days and in time for an event to take place, there should be some latitude that allows a reasonable period for an appeal to be made. The effect of limiting it to three weeks will result in people being prevented from appealing to the District Court either because they were away when the decision was made or did not have sufficient time to consult legal people, get the paperwork and so on in order and submit the appeal.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">The Minister of State should accept the amendment. Even though we have a responsibility to challenge legislation, we have been reasonably lenient in dealing with the Bill. I am concerned that bureaucratic impediments are being placed in the path of people who deal with the authorities. This three week period is another, and the argument put forward by Deputy Gilmore is reasonable. There are situations where people may not have the resources or ability to deal with a negative decision. They may, as Deputy Gilmore said, be on holidays when a decision is made. This time period is another example of a bureaucratic impediment being put in the paths of ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">An Bord Pleanála is an example in this regard. Even the most intelligent and clued in people are often fooled by the vagueness of documentation from the board on planning appeals. A recent example in Cork where a decision was made by a local authority involved professional people lodging separate appeals against that decision which were deemed invalid because of the vagueness of the terminology used by An Bord Pleanála. The appellants were informed that their appeals were ruled out on a basic technicality. No leeway was given nor was any flexibility shown. The heavy hand of bureaucracy came down on ordinary people attempting to defend their rights as citizens and property owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">This three week period is another example. It is too short. I have not heard a convincing argument from the Minister of State against Deputy Gilmore's proposal and I am sure this is an issue on which we would take a stand. We appeal to the Minister of State to compromise on this issue for the reasons stated.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">Can the Minister explain if there is a valid reason the period is only three weeks? What is the thinking behind that and what would be wrong with a longer period? It would not affect anyone except the applicant and it is reasonable to seek a longer period. Unless there is a valid and compelling reason, I cannot figure out why a period of only three weeks would be allowed in such cases. Sometimes people must have their appeals professionally prepared and that is not easily done within a short period. What is the reason for the inclusion of the three week period in the Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_820">The period of three weeks provided in the Bill is longer than the 14 day period permitted for an appeal against the fire safety notice to the District Court under section 20 of the Fire Services Act. The District Court can, in any event, extend the period, if required. As a gesture of goodwill and an appreciation of the contributions of all parties in the House, especially those Members directly involved in debating the legislation, perhaps they might accept an extension to four weeks, bearing in mind that the District Court can, in any event, extend that period if required.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">It is preferable for the fire authority to know within a reasonable time – I would have thought three weeks sufficient but other Members think it should be six weeks – if an appeal is to be lodged. If a four week period, as opposed to the three weeks suggested by me or the six weeks suggested by the Opposition, can be facilitated, I would not have a difficulty with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">None of us is interested in prolonging legal processes but it is a dangerous principle to enshrine in legislation restrictions on the rights of citizens to use the courts. There may well be some issue which arises at the District Court where an applicant feels that he or she has received an unfair hearing, or some legal issue or circumstance may arise which an applicant might feel justifies a hearing at a higher court. People should be entitled to exercise that right and the legislation should not restrict that. It should be left to the discretion of the people concerned. If they want to use the courts, let them use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">There is a right of appeal to the District Court. The legislation should be silent on the question of the use of the courts thereafter. That is something, obviously, that the people concerned speak to their lawyers about and, if they have sufficient grounds they proceed and justice takes its course. For the Bill itself to prohibit going to the Circuit Court in any circumstances is wrong and should not be part of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">At this stage I am sure the Deputies take the view that I am being totally unreasonable with them but I am not setting a precedent here today. This provision does not set a precedent. The amendments proposed by Deputy Gilmore would delete the subsection which states that no appeal will lie to the Circuit Court from a decision of the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The intention here is to provide a right of appeal to an applicant as is right and proper. This is not a third party appeal scenario. The promoter in amendment No. 12 will be further appealing a decision taken in the first instance by the fire authority as an expert licensing authority, and subsequent to that to the District Court, all in the interests of public safety. As I said at the outset this does not set a precedent.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I draw the Deputies' attention to section 21(7) of the Fire Services Act 1981 which allows no further appeal to the Circuit Court following service and confirmation of a fire safety notice. The provision in this Bill is identical to that section of the Fire Services Act 1981. One might ask why we cannot change that. It has served us well and has created no difficulties in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Under amendment No. 26, if the fire authority makes a decision regarding the withdrawal of a fire safety notice, and the District Court independently confirms and accepts the fire authority decision, there is no good reason to permit a further appeal to the Circuit Court. If this were to be permitted, I believe it would lead to fire authority personnel spending lengthy periods preparing court papers and appearing in court cases. The provision already exists in respect of section 21 (7) of the Fire Services Act 1981 which allows no further appeal to the Circuit Court following service and or confirmation of a fire safety notice.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">This is an amendment which I understand had been recommended to the Minister by the Chief Fire Officers' Association. Basically, the problem here is that the legislation as it is drafted really applies to circumstances where licences have been granted but where conditions attached to the licences are not being complied with. The authorised officer will have the power under the legislation to go in and inspect the event. If something is not in order, the authorised officer has the power to order that the event cease under the notice of cessation in section 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The arrangement which applies, as I understand it, in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act is that where the authorised officer sees something wrong, for example a fire escape door that should be unlocked, he can simply go in and order that it be opened rather than have the event closed down. What I am looking for in the legislation is something similar to that. In other words, if there is a condition of the event licence that is not being complied with the authorised officer can go in, find the organiser or whoever is in charge and simply ask him to comply with the regulation. For example, if there was a large public meeting or entertainment event which required that the participants be seated, the authorised officer might go in and find that there is a group of people standing up around the walls. The sensible solution is to instruct the owner to go out into the adjoining ballroom or whatever and bring in the extra chairs required and seat the people concerned, but the authorised officer will not have the power to do that. The only thing the authorised officer will have the power to do is to create the circumstances for a riot and to go in and say he has to close down the event and everybody must go home.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">It would be much more sensible to give the authorised officer in these circumstances the same type of power as already exists in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act. The officers should simply correct what needs to be corrected rather than order the organiser to draw the curtain on the event and send everybody home.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_846">If this amendment is not accepted the authorised officer would have no option but to close down an event. Particularly when dealing with issues of safety and crowd control the authorised officer would be bound, even against his own judgment, to order the closure or ending of an event if it did not comply with the Act, even in regard to minor matters, such as some of those suggested by Deputy Gilmore. If this amendment is accepted, the authorised officer would have the option of using his common sense to take either the ultimate step of closing down the venue or correcting whatever fault he found in his inspection or visit to the function. The Bill, as drafted, leaves the authorised officer with no option in the matter. That is very restrictive. It would be restrictive to the point where the outcome of closing a venue down might be worse than the offence. If, for example, 2,000 people, young or old, are interested in and enjoying a particular event and suddenly an authorised officer enters and says that because the organiser is in breach of X, Y or Z the venue has to be closed down, that could have serious consequences. The authorised officer who would be working under his superior's orders would have no option in the matter. Where everything is not in order but can reasonably be put in order, the authorised officers should be allowed some discretion.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_508" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_847">I have considered the proposed amendment in some detail in consultation with departmental fire advisory staff and senior fire officers of local authorities. I am still satisfied that improvement orders or notices will not be relevant to decisions under the licensing parts of the Bill, Parts 1 and 2, having regard to the timeframe of 28 days for decisions to be made by the fire authority. The improvement or prohibition orders, referred to by the Deputy, have lengthy and complicated appeal and court procedures and are not suitable for application in the licensing system proposed here. In this Bill we are dealing with an application for a licence to hold a large scale event safely from a crowd control point of view and a public safety perspective and the fire authority has roughly 28 days to determine the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">When dealing with the application the fire authority will have to examine plans, layout documents and a safety management plan for the event. If the fire authority's authorised officer considers that the venue cannot safely accommodate the event applied for because some improvement works need to be carried out, there is no problem if the works can be done within the timeframe before the event takes place. It is open to the fire authority to attach a condition to the licence that such improvement works can be carried out. If, however, the improvement works are substantial and could not possibly be addressed prior to the event, the fire authority has no option but to refuse the licence for the event. It must be remembered that the licensing system proposed in the Bill focuses on the safe running of the event and not on the venue. I am satisfied that under the Bill, authorised officers have sufficient powers of inspection, including a special warrant card, which will identify them clearly to the promoter as being empowered under the Bill by the fire authority to enter a premises, seek information and request that licence requirements are adhered to. The officer has substantial powers and can request that any matter he or she considers to be in breach of the licence and posing a threat to public safety be addressed. Promoters will also be aware if they are in breach of any aspect of their licence, whether a minor or a major breach, that records will be kept by the fire authorities and details sought at any subsequent application made for licences which would affect any future applications made by that person.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">With regard to Deputy Gilmore's suggestion of prohibition notices, as explained on Committee Stage I consider that the cessation notice proposed in the Bill is a more appropriate mechanism for dealing with an indoor event which poses a serious risk to the safety and welfare of persons attending the particular event. Other powers exist under sections 18 and 20 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended by this Bill, to deal with the improvement or prohibitions required at any venue at any time, quite separately from the licensing process. This issue was debated at length and a number of examples were outlined. If a venue was to accommodate only 900, it would not require a licence. If it was to accommodate 1,100 and there were only 950 seats and if the extra seats could be provided at short notice before the event commenced, I have no doubt the authorised officer would exercise discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">This is a matter of transferring responsibility from the promoters. The responsibility for crowd control and public safety is with the promoters. It is not a matter of transferring this responsibility to the authorised officer. The authorised officer can easily say, "if I were you, this is what I would do" but it is a matter for the promoters to control the crowds and ensure public safety. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment. If simple matters can be dealt with on the spot prior to the event, they should be dealt with by the promoter.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_851">Of course minor matters could be dealt with prior to the event. Suppose the authorised officer attends shortly after the event commences or, perhaps, when the crowd is gathering and there is a shortage of seats which could be provided, has he or she discretion at that stage? That is the important question. An hour or a day before the event the authorised officer would not know whether people would be standing at the wall, whether the door would be closed, whether the floor would be wet or whether something would be contrary to the regulations or the licence. What authority has the authorised officer any time after the event commences?</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_510" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_852">The authorised officer has very little authority after the event commences. It would be highly irresponsible of us to suggest that the authorised officer should have discretion after the event has commenced. This discretion should be exercised prior to the event. The provision in the Bill states that the authorised person may issue or serve a cessation notice. It does not require him to do this. We are dealing with a breach of a licence at an event in progress and that is too late for improvement works. The improvement works should be carried out prior to the commencement. The improvement works procedure is too lengthy for a licensing scenario when the event is taking place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_511">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_853">In the course of this exchange, we have unearthed two additional problems with the legislation. I take issue with the Minister painting a picture that the authorised officers can only take action before the event commences. If the authorised officer looks at a venue and discovers something is wrong and informs the owner, he will point out that unless it is corrected a cessation notice can be served. If he inspects it the following day and it has not been dealt with, he can serve a cessation notice saying the owner cannot proceed with an event to be held on the following Friday night. That is fair enough and I understand it. The legislation provides for the authorised officer to take action while the event is taking place. The Minister of State is saying that he does not envisage events being inspected at all while they are taking place. If that is the case, we are passing legislation which the Minister has no intention of enforcing. We are passing legislation about licensing conditions, but what the Minister has in mind is that the fire authority will not send anyone to the venue on a Friday night, for example, when an event is taking place. The fire authority may, if it gets around to it, send someone on the Wednesday or Thursday beforehand but there appears to be no serious intent to carry out inspections while the event is taking place. We are passing legislation which is not going to be enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">When I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage I thought we were dealing with a situation where there were going to be inspections of events as they took place. I was concerned that a fire officer would find himself in a ludicrous position of being at an event, seeing something wrong and being unable to do anything other than close the event down. It was to remedy that defect that I tabled the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">We raised the question on Commitee Stage of what resources would be available to local authorities to enable them to administer and enforce this legislation. It is clear that the Government is bringing in legislation for the optics. The Hamilton committee's report must be implemented and we must pretend to the public that we are doing something about making indoor events safer but there is no serious intent to have fire officers inspect them. If there were such an intent, we would be dealing with matters in the way I suggest in the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The Minister of State's response to the amendment makes it clear that there will be no departmental guidelines for fire officers. The reverse will, in fact, be encouraged. The legislation will discourage inspection. If fire officers know that the only thing the legislation allows them to do if they visit an event is to close it down, they will hardly be encouraged to do so. Unless a fire officer happens to be particularly brave he will not be encouraged to carry out inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">We have stumbled on another case of the Government legislating for the optics with no serious intent whatever to enforce or implement legislation in practice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_858">Of course there is a serious intent behind this legislation. I draw the Deputy's attention to section 11 which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Where a fire authority is of the opinion that an indoor event in respect of which a licence is required under section 5 is taking place or is likely to take place (a) without a licence, or (b) in contravention of a condition attached to or the terms of a licence, the fire authority may serve a notice of cessation on the owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Of course there will be spot checks where necessary and authorised officers will inspect venues. That will be essential. There would be no point in enacting such a Bill if there was no intention to carry out inspections prior to and during such events. While the inspection is being carried out, if the event is without a licence or is in contravention of a condition attached to the terms of the licence, the fire authority, or the authorised officer, may serve a notice of cessation on the owner or occupier of the building concerned or on any person who, in the opinion of the fire officer, is holding, organising or is otherwise materially involved in the organisation of the indoor event. A notice of cessation may require all or any of the three requirements set out in section 11(2) <i>(a), (b)</i>and <i>(c)</i> of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">If the impression was given that fire officers would only visit prior to and at the commencement of events, that was a wrong impression. It is clear from the Bill that authorised officers, who will be appointed by the fire authority within the local authority, will have the power to inspect prior to and during events. It is the intention that they will do that.</p>

Nothing happened between 1989 and 1996 even though Mr. Justice Hamilton issued his report. In 1996 the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, set up a working party which reported in 1998. Now, five years after the publication of that working party's report and 14 years after the tragedy in Hillsborough we are presented with legislation which we are being asked to nod through.</p>

We should add the words, "through its chief fire officer or inspection officer". Any decision made by an officer of insufficient rank or experience could be tested successfully and the fire authority would be open to challenge.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_876">I welcome the opportunity, with other Members of the House of all parties, to affirm and endorse support for the major humanitarian effort currently under way in Iraq. It is worth remembering that humanitarianism has its origins in conflicts and wars where people decided that the civilians and non-combatants had to be protected. The humanitarian impulse has always been non-political, and non-judgmental in regard to the victims of war, both civilians and combatants. Our international systems of humanitarian relief grew out of the disaster of the Second World War and they have proven remarkably robust both legally and operationally since then. The United Nations has always been at the centre of this system and it must remain so.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The current humanitarian crisis in Iraq has come about as a result of two international conflicts, the Iran-Iraq war and the Gulf War, ten years of international sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and now this war. In 20 years Iraq has been reduced from a state of relative prosperity to one of mass poverty and ill health. Because of this deterioration in the basic living conditions over the past decade the population of 27 million has very weak coping systems and is far more vulnerable to the shocks and battery of this war than it was in 1991. The ongoing and defiant refusal of the regime to comply with the UN resolutions and the resulting sanctions has resulted in 16 million or some 60% of Iraqis being dependent on Government rations for their food through the oil for food programme. This programme was stopped at the start of the current conflict and left millions of people without access to food.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Security Council has recently passed Resolution 1447 authorising the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme for the next 45 days and possibly longer. It is difficult to see how this can be done since, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins pointed out last night, it involved 40,000 Iraqi workers before the conflict began. It is absolutely essential that the UN, which has now been given a mission to reinstate this programme, be allowed to do so without the militarisation of the humanitarian effort. As we debate this motion our thoughts and concerns are with the vulnerable civilian population who are caught up in this conflict. Their situation is becoming more hazardous and pathetic with every passing day. Those of us in positions of influence who watch in horror the scenes on our television screens must not allow ourselves to become passive observers or accept the inevitability of this war continuing <i>ad infinitum.</i>It is not enough for Ireland to respond to the humanitarian aid effort. We must use our authority at the United Nations and galvanise international support for ways in which to moderate the bellicose excesses of this war and to argue that it be brought to an end as quickly as possible so as to minimise human suffering and death. This becomes even more imperative with the news that today a hospital was bombed in Baghdad.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The major casualty of this conflict apart from the innocent lives which have been lost has been the authority of the United Nations. We have seen the United Nations emasculated to an extent, which is deeply worrying for everybody's future and for our collective security.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">We fervently hoped that this military action could be averted. We hoped that Iraq could be disarmed peacefully and that any military intervention would have the backing of a second UN resolution. Because we were central to the negotiation and unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441 and because this war is being prosecuted in the name of that resolution there is a real discomfort, unease and shame among Irish people that in some way we are complicit. This war is not the outcome which the Government sought. On the contrary, it is exactly what we always wanted to avoid.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">From the earliest days post-11 September, as a member of the Security Council we tried through diplomacy, friendships, contacts and clout to moderate the reflexive instincts for vengeance and unilateral retribution on the part of the United States and its allies. We argued for a multilateral response and insisted that the war against terrorism should front-load the humanitarian issues and ensure they were not sidelined. During the war in Afghanistan prosecuted under UN mandate we insisted at all times that humanitarian issues were centre stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The humanitarian arena is where we have credibility in international affairs. We are a non-aligned, traditionally neutral country. Our tradition is very strongly and unequivocally one which highlights the peaceful settlement of international disputes, which upholds the primacy of the United Nations and which places development, justice and human rights central to our foreign policy. We have a reputation for excellence, professionalism and even-handedness in peacekeeping and peacemaking. To our credit, we are a leading donor of overseas development assistance. We do not favour wars and we have made plain we will not participate in this war. We favour peacekeeping and conflict resolution and we invest heavily in a long-term way in building up partnerships with developing countries in the poorest parts of the world, defending human rights, building robust democracies in poor countries and defending the rights of the vulnerable and the poor in natural and man-made disasters. That is what we do. We also respect the sovereignty of nations. There should be an immediate involvement of the UN to guarantee the integrity of Iraq after the military conflict ends. The UN should be working flat out to ensure the stability of the region is maintained and that there will be no extension of hostilities beyond the boundaries of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Already our NGOs are active in Iraq and there will be no shortage of funding. We have a large humanitarian budget, which has flexibility and can respond very quickly to emergencies such as this. Yesterday we had briefings from two Irish operational agencies, GOAL and Concern, both of whom stressed the need for the immediate demilitarisation of aid and for the UN to come back centre stage in the planning and implementation of the humanitarian effort. This is vital for the security of humanitarian workers and also because humanitarian agencies have an independence and a professionalism in the distribution of aid which cannot be replicated by soldiers. The chaotic scenes of aid being thrown off lorries by soldiers to fit young men rather than in an orderly fashion to the most vulnerable civilians have shocked those of us who know how such food distributions should be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Many people are shattered and deeply conflicted by this war. This stems from the fact that, notwithstanding great diplomatic efforts, international consensus at the UN was not achievable, and we now have a war whose legality is disputed by many. This has divided Europe, NATO and even the British Parliament. Nobody doubts that Saddam Hussein's regime is a ruthless and bloody dictatorship. Nobody denies that Iraq has been in wilful defiance of the international community. Nobody denies that the suspicion that it was in possession of weapons of mass destruction posed a potential threat to the security of the world. What is at issue is whether we had definitively reached the point of last resort to justify an attack of this magnitude by two superpowers against a country whose civilian population is so vulnerable in a conflict, one which has the capacity to destabilise the whole region and inflame tensions between the Muslim and western world.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">As a former Irish Minister responsible for our aid programme, I am concerned that the world is being diverted and distracted from the humanitarian disaster unfolding in southern Africa. It is a tragedy that there are currently more than 30 million people in acute need of food aid in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Eritrea, but this has slipped off the world's agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">This is a hugely expensive war with the cost of the first 30 days of the military intervention estimated at $62 billion according to a budget supplement issued to the US Congress last week. The allocation for reconstruction was $1.7 billion and the humanitarian interventions allocation was $500 million dollars. The humanitarian budget is therefore 3.5% of that for the prosecution of the conflict. This is a big war in every way. The jingoistic media coverage from the US networks is quite an offence to thinking people. As it develops and as the civilian casualties mount many people are reduced to head-hanging despair, not only for the loss of life but for the perceived dearth of intelligent discourse at the highest level in the United States. Divisions are emerging in the Bush administration about post-war Iraq. Colin Powell's State Department has a different view from that of the Pentagon. Where does this leave the UN? It appears that the only role envisaged by the Pentagon for the UN is the distribution of humanitarian aid under US supervision. Kofi Annan has argued for the operational independence of the UN relief agencies, which I wholeheartedly support.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The UN must play a central role in preparing for the ultimate outcome of the Iraqi people running their own, sovereign country. That is being lost in the din of war. Meanwhile, attention has been averted from the wider conflict in the Middle East, which is disastrous. It is imperative that the road map for peace and security be published and form the basis for negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinian authorities. The Palestinians have appointed a new prime minister and are ready for negotiations. The US should take the lead in driving these negotiations. It is very important that, as the Arab world views the conflict in Iraq, the Middle East is being forgotten.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_888">I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that one of the casualties of the war has been the authority of the United Nations. There is no question that this war has damaged the UN. The failure to arrive at a second resolution was a disaster for the UN which, in spite of this, continues to have a very important role. Everybody acknowledges that the UN is an imperfect system. Allowing five nations to carry a veto is not an exercise in democracy. It is not what one would expect of a national parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">As a result, international law is imperfect, but it is the only law we have and we must proceed on that basis. It is disappointing that the attitude of the United States is unilateral in so many respects. It is unilateral in failing to endorse a ban on landmines, in failing to ban nuclear testing, in failing to respect anti-ballistic missile treaties, in failing to back the Kyoto Protocol and in so many other respects, including the failure to sign up to the International Criminal Court. It conducts many bilateral agreements with other countries in order to try to avoid the effects of that court. All of this is disappointing and is damaging to the United Nations, to multilateralism and to international law, with all its imperfections.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">After the Second World War, Winston Churchill berated neutral Ireland for frolicking somewhat with the Japanese and the Germans, to the point where the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, signed the book of condolences for Adolf Hitler at the end of the war at the German Embassy in Dublin. Churchill said that the British were very restrained in not invading Ireland and resisting the provocation of our attitudes to Japan and Germany. Mr. de Valera, very wisely, delivered a measured and temperate response, saying that Britain's need should never become a moral code. It strikes me now that the US need, which is a real one, has become a moral code and a way of steam-rollering institutions that have been built up with great difficulty and effort. US need is not a moral code but multilateralism is. It has served the test of time, with all its imperfections.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">There is no question that the United States will win this war, as it won the war in Afghanistan. The question is whether it will win the peace. It arguably did win the peace after the Second World War because the Soviet Union had as repressive a regime as the Nazi regime that was toppled in 1945. Many wars end in military victory, but what constitutes peace and the successful achievement of war aims is quite different. The American war aim in Afghanistan was clearly to crack down on terrorism, but neither Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar or the al-Qaeda network generally were captured or conquered. Thus, one must question whether the specific war aims of the US were ever achieved. One must also ask whether any commitments were properly delivered upon in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The major powers, including the European Union, met in Tokyo in January 2002 and commitments were made for humanitarian relief to help Afghanistan out of the position in which it found itself. It was acknowledged at that point that a sum in the region of $9 billion to €15 billion was required to reconstruct Afghanistan. The Afghans have been let down in terms of the commitments made in Tokyo, and we must learn from that. There is no guarantee that the funds that will be promised after the war in Iraq – assuming it ends the way I think it will – will be delivered. This Government is doing its bit by providing €5 million, and that is to be applauded. It is a worthy effort and is in keeping with Ireland Aid's great contribution over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">US Aid has failed to deliver the contribution it said it would make over 12 months ago in Tokyo. I came across a website called www.developmentgateway.org, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_894">In January 2002 at a conference in Tokyo, the world's richest nations pledged to give €1.8 billion dollars in aid to Afghanistan by the end of 2002. However, aid trickled slowly into the country throughout the war. The Government of Afghanistan, NGOs and multilateral institutions called upon donors to deliver on pledges they had made. More than half of the pledges for humanitarian efforts at the Tokyo conference were based upon a preliminary needs assessment for reconstruction assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">There is a problem here. Let us take the intentions of the United States at face value, putting aside all our scepticism and cynicism about what are its real motives. Even if it makes commitments after wars like that in Afghanistan, it is not delivering upon them. That is the lesson we must take on board in this debate about humanitarian aid to Iraq. The US failed to carry out its promises for post-war Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan failed to achieve its aims – neither the military aim of finding Osama bin Laden and getting rid of al-Qaeda nor the humanitarian aims of reconstructing the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Another website pointed out in March 2003 that families evicted from a high school in Kabul were forced to seek shelter in a nearby neighbourhood, living in makeshift shelters. Of the 87 families evicted from the school, 27 have been identified by the UNHCR as eligible for return assistance, while the remaining 60 families have received non-food items from the assistance community. Thus, there is an ongoing humanitarian crisis in that part of Kabul. Nothing has been solved by war. I hasten to suggest that the current military action will achieve as little and that nothing will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The difference between Afghanistan and Iraq is that there was a humanitarian presence in Iraq prior to the war of 2001. It was able to return there afterwards and deliver services quickly. It will be all the more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid to Iraq after the present war, so the omens are very bad. Another bad omen arose yesterday at the meeting of the committee on foreign affairs, when GOAL's John O'Shea pointed out that the military is heavily involved in Afghanistan at the moment. My understanding is that US helicopters are delivering food aid and have taken over from NGOs. Trust that has been built up in the community has been eroded as a result and NGOs are losing their footing in the community. People in the community are unable to make the distinction between NGOs and the military. As a result, the entire humanitarian effort is undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">US Aid has said that this direction to use the military has come straight from the top, from Washington. It strikes me again that the United States administration has a narrow, blinkered and purely military outlook on changes which may take place in these countries. At best its view is not rigorous or clear. There are many failings. My concern is that in Iraq, the military will be used to deliver humanitarian aid when the war is over. What will be needed when this war is over is mine clearing. There will have to be dignity in the delivery of humanitarian aid. What we have seen on the television where trucks are unloaded and food boxes are flung at people is typical of a military trying to deliver humanitarian aid whereas NGOs have far greater experience in such matters. There needs to be local delivery by local people and NGOs have that skill. As I said, I do not believe military involvement is helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">We should not forget that there are many humanitarian crises around the world, none of them quite as fashionable as the Iraqi one. <i>The Economist </i>has a big piece this week about the Congo where 3.5 million people have died since 1998. Not a single word has been spoken or question raised in this House about how we will help them or energise the UN or the EU to try to help. There are also humanitarian crises in Chechnya and Tibet. There are many humanitarian crises around the world yet, unfortunately, they are not on everybody's lips at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Many Members said that we, on this side of the House, cannot speak out of both sides of our mouths because, on the one hand, we are assisting the war, but I do not believe that. Our neutrality has operated hand in hand with our policy on Shannon for over 45 years. What we are being asked to do is to abandon that form of neutrality for a different form of neutrality. That is a fair point to make.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">One can call it whatever one wants. What we have had so far is a militarily non-aligned neutrality and we propose to continue along those lines. If one is asking for a new departure and a new type of neutrality, that is also a legitimate request to make but one should be clear about that. We are not departing from a particular policy but the Opposition is looking for the Government to depart from the traditional policy. If that is the wish, it is something we can discuss but it is not something we would do lightly and it would require nationally based consultation and a national forum on neutrality and the totality of our relationships with the United States, NATO and the UK, whether political, economic or military. All these issues would have to be discussed, ideally, away from the emotive atmosphere of a conflagration such as this.</p>

It is due not only to this war but to the previous Iran-Iraq war and the subsequent mismanagement of the Iraqi economy since then. The population has been weakened and has become very vulnerable. This is very clearly illustrated by the figures from the United Nations human development index which show that Iraq has fallen from 96th to 127th in the world. That is one of the fastest falls of any country in the world, if not the fastest. It is an appalling indictment of the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">I understand over 60% of the population of Iraq is dependent on the UN oil for food programme. As we all know that programme has been suspended since the start of the conflict and we can only imagine how more than 60% of the population of that country are suffering because of lack of food and other help.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">This issue raises the importance of the United Nations. The authority of the United Nations has suffered a severe dent because of the action of the US and UK Governments in going into Iraq. If the United Nations is to re-establish its moral authority, now is a very opportune time for it to do so. Resolution 1447 gives the UN Secretary General the right or ability to administer aid for the next 45 days. It is imperative that any humanitarian aid which goes into Iraq goes in under the guise of the United Nations. It is wrong for aid to go in as a pay-off for the military action taking place at the moment. Like Deputy O'Donnell, I found it appalling to see soldiers handing out aid from the backs of lorries with the clear implication that it was coming from one of the invading countries. Now is the time for the United Nations to re-establish its moral authority and I am delighted that this country is going down the road of using the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">As part of the war problem, much damage has been caused to the health service in Iraq. I am aware there are some excellent hospitals in Baghdad. My only worry is that some of those hospitals would be used for the republican guard and Saddam Hussein's extended family only. Some years ago I had occasion to spend time working not in Iraq, but in a neighbouring country. It struck me that while their hospital facilities were among the best in the world, they were very deficient at primary care level. I have no reason to believe the situation is any different in Iraq today. One can only imagine the dreadful suffering which is occurring as people flock to hospitals, some of which have been bombed, and are basically deprived of primary care at any level. It is also upsetting to learn that stocks in hospitals are at a very low level. I understand some hospitals have as little as three weeks supply, and it might even be less now.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">At the best of times many of the peripheral hospitals would not be of the standard of the tertiary hospitals in Baghdad. The doctors and nurses there are labouring under intense stress. I have no doubt that with the casualties coming from the war – I believe there are severe casualties – the stress of trying to alleviate those patients' sufferings must be immense.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">It is important that water and electricity are re-established as soon as possible. The sewerage and water systems are dependent on electricity. Unfortunately, the generating stations have been hit by bombs and it is imperative that in a country like Iraq with a warm climate, both sewerage and water systems are of the highest standard, otherwise prevalence and incidence of diseases will be immense. I noted with interest on Sky News or on CNN that the UK army was busily trying to re-establish the electricity connections to one of the southern towns which it had damaged. It was obviously a great publicity coup but it is distasteful to think that it happened as a result of a war instituted by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the Government for very promptly allocating €5 million to alleviate suffering. This is a small country but it has built up a worldwide reputation for helping those in distress. Much of our aid in the past few years has gone to Africa. There is a huge crisis now and the swift and prompt allocation by the Minister of €5 million to Iraq is to be warmly welcomed. I also welcome the fact that he is allocating it through the NGOs and the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">This is the way forward. One of the things that has upset me about this war is that if history teaches us anything, it is that when empires are unopposed, they tend to get expansionist ideas. Invariably, they will expand beyond their own areas and cause distress and loss of life. All human life is sacred. I hope that what is happening in Iraq is not the sign of an empire beginning to go out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I commend the motion and congratulate Fine Gael for putting it before the House. It is important that help is got into Iraq now, not in 20, 30 or 40 days.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_913">Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of speaking on this motion. Before I go into the details, I want to put on record once again my total opposition to the war in Iraq. This war is immoral, illegal and, above all, wrong. The vast majority of Irish people also support this position and it is essential that we respect that view if we are serious about democracy. So far in this conflict, the Government has walked away from its responsibilities, shown a complete lack of leadership and is out of touch with people on the ground. The use of Shannon is wrong and a breach of our neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The humanitarian crisis has begun and it is essential for Members to put past differences aside and to support this motion. Despite the fact that I was dismayed and disappointed by the lack of support from Fine Gael and the Government for the anti-war march last Saturday, I will be supporting this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">It is important that we take heed of the warnings of the aid agencies and get assistance in quickly. We now have significant malnutrition in children under five years old, one million malnourished children, some 60% of whom are without clean water, 60% of the Iraqi people are dependent on Government food subsidies, there are major shortages of essential drugs and antibiotics, innocent people are being slaughtered and conscripts with white flags are being shot and killed. We have also seen the slaughter in the cities and at road checkpoints by US and British troops.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">We have to intervene with aid and assistance but that should always be with the UN and aid agencies. It is time to put the so-called military strategists in their box and protect the people of Iraq. It is never too late and let us not be afraid to challenge those that say it is too late and that we cannot do anything. This type of cop-out politics must be faced down. We can always do something and this motion is an effort to prevent a disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Section 11 of the motion calls on the Government to work to ensure that the UN plays the lead co-ordinating role in the humanitarian relief. We need to ensure that this happens and we have to win back the UN from the wreckers and ensure that the UN remains the central body in world policing, not the United States, Great Britain or NATO. Then we all win, not just the Iraqi people. If we do not go this route, the whole world is at risk and the violence, death and slaughter will worsen.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">This is a wake-up call for all our people as well as the smug sections of Irish society that understand this war or privately support it. Sadly, those people are in Government and it now seems that some of them are pushing their own agenda regarding Irish foreign policy. The Bushites in the Cabinet have to be exposed. People can huff and puff as long as they want but the reality is that those with big business interests in this country, Britain and the USA all support this horrific war.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">Let them stand up and deny this. Their silence over the last ten days is deafening. The big players seem to have no problem with spending over €132 billion on war yet ignore humanitarian efforts and famine. I reject the remarks made last night by Deputy O'Connor regarding the anti-war movement. The anti-war movement is peaceful, open and democratic and deserves our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">This motion is about real people, real life and, above all, it has the potential to save life. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_530">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_921">The condition of Iraq and its people, as depicted in this motion, is harrowing, and, in what has been dubbed the first war of the 21st century, is evocative of Dante's inferno. The coalition of the willing has reduced the once-proud country of Iraq to this state; and, speaking of coalitions, I recall an old definition of "coalition" which could not be more appropriate to the co-operation between the United States and the UK against Iraq. In the <i>Devil's Dictionary,</i> the word “coalition” or the alignment of groups was defined as the co-operation between two thieves, who have their hands so deep in each other's pockets that they cannot rob a third person separately, though that is no reflection on Members on the opposite side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The Americans and British are possessed by an unquenchable thirst for reconstructing. The trouble is that in order to rebuild something, one has to demolish it first; if there is no destruction, there can be no reconstruction. The British and Americans are preoccupied with destroying Iraq systematically. Missiles, bombs, tanks, artillery, ships and infantry – everything is employed to facilitate the reconstruction of the country. The main objective of the urge for reconstruction is, of course, Baghdad, a city of five million people with miles of buildings and streets which can be reconstructed after their demolition. If Baghdad becomes the site of Stalingrad-style street fighting, house by house and street by street, there will, indeed, be a lot to reconstruct.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Large American conglomerates are already quarrelling about the spoils but, of course, no foreigners come into this. To quote an American saying: "To the victors belong the spoils."  An obnoxious sight, even before Iraqi towns and cities are destroyed, is that of corporate giants dividing among themselves the profits of war.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Anglo-Americans are obsessed with humanitarian aid. That great humanitarian, Donald Rumsfeld, has ordained that no ceasefire shall take place to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged city of Basra. The policy is to keep bombing the people until they are ripe for aid. Accordingly, it is the humanitarian duty of the Americans to take hold of the oil fields as quickly as possible, not for themselves – perish the thought – but for the Iraqis, in order to help them and do good. All this comes after UN sanctions, imposed as demanded by the Americans, that have for many years accomplished most of what is contained in the preamble to this motion and destroyed Iraqi infrastructure in the name of oil for food. The new humanitarianism is clear. "We had to destroy Iraq over the past 12 years and in the past two weeks, in order to save it. Who will we save next?"</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The role of the UN in spearheading the real humanitarian aid effort will be crucial and, as it has done in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo in recent years, it can be relied upon to provide humanitarian assistance to affected and vulnerable populations, whether inside Iraq or in neighbouring countries. Its previous practice has been to provide such assistance in strict adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the mandates of the United Nations and its emergency response agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The UN's preliminary estimate with the commencement of hostilities is that €2.4 billion will be required to assist the Iraqi people over the six-month period until September 2003. It is essential that it receives pledges of funds and resources from the donor countries and, presumably, from the oil-for-food programme when it is reinstated, for an effective response with emergency life-saving assistance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_531">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_927">It is fair to say that Ireland's role in regard to the Iraq crisis has been a dismal failure of foreign policy. We have tried to play to both sides of the conflict. We said that we would support a new resolution but when that did not come, we backed America anyway. Despite that, our actions have earned us no new friends in America because we waited so long. Even our European colleagues will see us as fair weather friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Over 100 countries voted for Ireland's term on the UN Security Council. I wonder what is their impression of the Government's response to the crisis. Do they watch with shock and awe or do they feel just as cheated by the Government as many of those who voted last May? It might be seen as funny to watch the Government moving not towards Boston or even Berlin, but ever closer to the mythical Ballymagash. Sadly, we are showing an immature reaction to this war.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The hype on international news channels makes a mockery of what war is about. We are watching the most powerful nation in the world pulverise an impoverished desert nation ruled by another despot. The cool, clean heroes of the American army drop nine tonne bombs from 35,000 feet and fire cruise missiles over 200 miles from their final destination while their effort at humanity is to kick food off the back of a lorry to starving, innocent civilians.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Our own experience in Northern Ireland has taught us that war will always be a tragic event. I fear that irreversible damage has already been done to international relationships. The chances of future stability in the region can be improved if a massive humanitarian effort is commenced immediately. The Government can be proactive, for once, and can be seen to make a genuine effort to do the right thing by supporting the humanitarian effort. It should insist on the involvement of the United Nations in the delivery of the humanitarian aid and in peacekeeping duties in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">When the Taoiseach frets about the airport of choice for moving 100,000 troops to the Middle East, he may not realise that the majority of US soldiers, most of whom come from the poorer sections of American society, do not know the difference between Shannon and Frankfurt. The Government has gone along with this war because, in some respects, it wants to believe that it is a just war. If this is not an oil-grabbing exercise, the US will be delighted when the Taoiseach proposes that it and other members of the coalition of the willing should hand over to the UN those sections of Iraq that are under their control. I commend this motion to the House and I hope that the Government takes action as a result of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_932">The House is aware that the Taoiseach wears many hats. He was wearing his pacifist hat this morning when he told the House that "all war . . .  is wrong", a statement of which Mahatma Ghandi might have been proud. If all war is wrong, it is fair to presume that the war in Iraq is wrong, and if the war in Iraq is wrong, surely the Government should stop assisting the US war effort which is killing innocent Iraqi women and children. How many broken bodies, broken lives and tragedies have to be witnessed before the Government revises its view of the war?</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The Fine Gael motion before the House should have dealt with the matters I have mentioned. Although it is worthy, it lets the Government off the hook because it does not make it face up to its responsibilities. It allows the Government to overlook the obscenity of the fact that the Iraqi people have been bombed and then, subsequently, provided with humanitarian assistance. An Iraqi woman said on "Prime Time" last night that she would be happy for humanitarian assistance not to be given to the Iraqi people. She said that they will not require it if they are not bombed. The distribution of humanitarian aid has featured chaotic scenes involving soldiers. We know from the United Nations that more humanitarian workers have been killed than UN soldiers, which is an incredible fact. It is obvious from what is happening in Iraq that the soldiers who are distributing humanitarian aid there have not been trained to do so as they are simply throwing it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I predicted before this war that it would destabilise the Middle East region, create the conditions for further terrorism and result in this humanitarian crisis. I take no consolation whatsoever in being proved right. We are told that humanitarian aid is being distributed by the soldiers as a confidence building measure. Those involved in this war want to be seen as liberators and not invaders. We were told that roses would be thrown in front of them as they arrived in Iraq, but it has not worked out like that. I believe that the crisis in Iraq will work out like Northern Ireland or the West Bank. Iraq will be destabilised as the Shiite and Sunni communities, as well as others, fight each other, and perhaps also the invader, over a long period of years. It is clear that the Bush administration has made a bad miscalculation in this matter. The dangerous people I would single out would be Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Perle, Mr. Cheney and, of course, Mr. Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">When the Taoiseach spoke about the dangers of Saddam Hussein this morning, he said that it is necessary to deal with a man who has not lived up to his obligations. It is not worth spilling Iraqi blood to deal with Saddam Hussein, however, as Iraqi people will testify. We have to ask ourselves a simple question, would we sacrifice our children to get rid of a dictator? The answer is "No", we would not do so. The Taoiseach and the Government have to face up to their responsibilities. When the Taoiseach was asked a direct question about pre-emptive strikes this morning, he said it was not for him to give an opinion on whether they are legal or illegal. We have become used to such responses. The Taoiseach should know that other neutral states have given their opinions on this matter – they have said clearly that such strikes are illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I do not accept for a moment the disingenuous views put forward this evening by Deputy Andrews, who said that to stop the use of Shannon Airport by the US military would represent a "departure". If the policy being pursued by the Government in relation to Shannon is its normal one, why did it not say so before a decision was forced on it? If the Government is serious about peace and humanitarian assistance, it should put down a motion which calls on all countries to unite for peace under the United Nations.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">Sinn Féin welcomes any motion brought before the House that unambiguously opposes the Government's support for the invasion of Iraq. This motion makes us face the devastating humanitarian consequences of the Government's present policy of complicity, a policy that is about to be condemned by the Irish Human Rights Commission. The Government's endorsement of this motion, which recognises the terrible humanitarian consequences of the war, is not to be welcomed as it amounts to disgusting hypocrisy. The Government seems to believe in a twisted Jekyll and Hyde version of neutrality as it is content to help the United States to wage war while professing its intention to help the people of Iraq to recover from that war. The Government hopes to be able to straddle the fence, but it cannot have it both ways. I do not believe that this policy represents real neutrality and I do not accept the Government's crocodile tears for the civilians of Iraq, including children.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">It is not enough for the Government merely to play a full role in the international relief effort – it must take every diplomatic step available to it to stop the conflict. This process must start with the withdrawal of the Government's logistical support for the war. While it is desirable, it is not enough that the Government intends to work to ensure that the United Nations plays a leading role in the humanitarian effort, to ensure that the EU and the UN fully fund the effort and to ensure the funds are not diverted from the ongoing needs of other regions. The UN, the EU and Ireland should not have to underwrite a mop-up operation for an illegal war that is being waged against the consent of the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">There must be no diversion, appropriation or redistribution by the invading forces of humanitarian aid. Food and other forms of aid should not be used by such forces as a propaganda tool, as part of a hearts-and-minds psychological operation against the Iraqi people, or as a form of bribery. The invaders should pay war reparations, which should be independently administered by the United Nations and other international non-governmental relief agencies. There must be no foreign military rule in Iraq at any stage, even on an interim basis. The Government must condemn, publicly and unreservedly, the obscene waste of billions of dollars on this invasion at a time when 14 million people are facing starvation in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The people of many other parts of Africa, such as north Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Burundi, Malawi and Mozambique are facing food insecurity.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Sinn Féin is calling on the Government to campaign actively for an immediate end to the war, including the invasion. It should cease its participation in it. Government policy should embrace a policy of positive neutrality which includes a multi-front war against poverty. The Government should press for these aims bilaterally at the European Union and the United Nations in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people. The Government should clearly state its opposition to this war and promise the withdrawal of all support for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_943">I rise to support the Fine Gael motion and to commend our party leader, Deputy Kenny, and our spokesperson on foreign affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for bringing it before the House. I commend the Government also for endorsing the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">There was stark evidence of the devastation in Iraq last night on "Prime Time". For those of us who saw them, the pictures were frightening and terrible. Nobody should suffer in the way we saw, but my focus in this debate is on the children who are suffering in this war. To do so is not to minimise the suffering of women and men, the old and the infirm and those with disabilities. In Basra alone, UNICEF reports that 100,000 children under the age of five are at risk and the Government should urge the United States and the United Kingdom to cease their aerial bombardment of cities. It is taking the lives of children on a daily basis. Prior to the start of the war, humanitarian agencies and aid workers repeatedly stated their concerns that a conflict would lead to the deaths of thousands of Iraqi children. Their estimates were based on the fact that nearly eight million of Iraq's 13 million children depend on a highly centralised Government-run food distribution system. Most of that food distribution has been curtailed which means that eight million children are at immediate risk. Of Iraq's children, 500,000 suffer from severe malnutrition, mostly as a result of the sanctions. Child mortality rates are 2.5 times greater than the levels prior to the Gulf War while more than one in eight children die before they reach their fifth birthday. This is one of the world's highest mortality rates and is obviously a result of the sanctions. Only 40% of Iraqi children have access to fresh water.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The disruption to food and water supplies and to access to medicines and health care is having a catastrophic effect on children in Iraq. US and British war planes are reported in the media to have targeted communications, transportation and urban infrastructure which will obviously cut off the supply of food. We have seen cuts in the electricity and water supplies and though some of it is reported to have been restored, we do not know what the true situation is. If the water is cut off, children will die. The Children's Rights Alliance provided the Taoiseach with copies of its report on our common responsibility which states that a study of the impact of a new war on Iraqi children was conducted by a Canadian-led international team through a fact-finding mission to the country earlier this year. The study's authors included independent experts in the fields of health, nutrition and emergency preparedness who concluded that, while the exact number of child deaths could not be predicted, casualties among children would probably be in the tens of thousands and possibly in the hundreds of thousands. Events to date have reinforced their findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Steps can still be taken to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Raymond Dooley, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance in Ireland, has pointed out that tens of thousands of extremely vulnerable children stand at the brink or are dead. The war has further disrupted their access to clean water, food and medical care and many will die. Most will not be killed directly by bombs, bullets or fire, instead, already weak from malnutrition, they will succumb to common and preventable diseases resulting in diarrhoea and dehydration from which they will die. The number who die will be determined principally by the intensity and duration of the aerial bombardment of Iraqi cities and the extent to which the war is prosecuted in urban areas. To help save the lives of thousands of children, the Government must call on the United States of America and the United Kingdom to cease the aerial bombardment and withdraw their forces from urban areas. If enough countries and people insist that the fate of millions of Iraqi children be accorded central rather than merely peripheral status in the moral calculus of this war, deaths may be averted.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The United Nations Security Council may have been brushed aside, but world opinion, the statements of governments and, potentially, the General Assembly of the United Nations can still make a difference. With the fate of so many children hanging in the balance, each of us is morally obliged to speak and act on their behalf and to do all we can to save their lives. Maura Quinn, the executive director of UNICEF, has said it is a fact that children will die in this war, but the question is how many can we protect. That must be a priority now. The aid agencies claim that reports from Baghdad confirm that children in the city are suffering obvious signs of trauma consisting of continuous crying, fear of loud noises and nightmares. The closure of schools and the resulting ending of normal life exacerbates the problem.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_948">I watched like everybody else for the last week or two the war coverage on Sky News, CNN and Fox News. War is not a football match or a western movie, it involves real people and real lives and I am appalled by the way it has been portrayed. I compliment RTE whose coverage was balanced and showed viewers the effects of war through images of women and children lying dead in the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The winners in war are the weapons manufacturers who make millions of dollars. The losers are the women who pick up the pieces and the children who suffer. The women and children of Iraq will be affected by this war for the next 30 years. The only winners in war are the multinationals who are involved in supplying weapons to all governments. I am pleased Fine Gael moved this motion and I am pleased to note the Government's support. However, that support must take the form of real money to assist the people of Iraq when this war is ended. I hope the Government, even at this stage, will call on the Americans and the British to allow fresh supplies of medicine into Iraq for one day at least to aid dying women and children. Hospitals are unable to look after the sick and dying. If America and Britain have any guts they will allow the United Nations one day to get these supplies in.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">There are no winners in war.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Government must provide as much money as possible. It can find money for everything else, from the Bertie bowl to Government jets. This war is the greatest tragedy to hit the world since the Second World War and I call on the Government and all the political parties in this House to make sure that the money and resources, whatever is necessary, are made available immediately the war is over to help the people, particularly women and children, of Iraq. We should not just talk about it, we should go in and do something. We should not heed America or Britain, or anybody else. We should support the UN to make sure that the women and children suffer no more.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The people outside are appalled by what they saw on television last night, and I compliment RTE again. The Government must take the necessary action to deal with this, but wherever the Government finds the funding, it should not be at the expense of the aid we are supplying to other Third World countries. There are other tragedies that have been forgotten because the number one agenda now is the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">I want to finish where I started. The losers are the women and children. It is terrible that innocent people are being slaughtered, and that is what is happening now. They are being slaughtered on the streets of Iraq. We should give whatever help we can when the time comes. I hope the British and American Governments will provide a chance to get the aid in for a couple of days to try to deal with the people who are dying. It must be terrible to have a child on an emergency table and no doctor to deal with him or her, no medication and nothing that can be done. Have they not suffered enough because of one lunatic? It is a pity the Americans and the British could not have taken out that lunatic without killing innocent people. It should be remembered that it was not previously beyond the capabilities of the British or the Americans to take out dictators, and they could have done so this time if they had wanted to.</p>

          <p eId="para_954">Like other speakers, I am opposed to this war. We as a country must take an honourable and a principled stand on the question of humanitarian aid. This resolution is one which, for once, unites this House and all parties. It unites the whole country behind the concept that Ireland cares. Whatever influence we have in the world community should be brought to bear on the warring nations and particularly on the United Nations to insist on the primacy of care and concern, as so eloquently put by my colleague, Deputy Ring, for the women and children, the innocent people who suffer in this war. They should be given a priority and that priority has to be a political priority given by countries other than the combatants.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">In the last century we had the war to end all wars, the war to rid the world of fascism, the war to rid the world of communism. All these things are still with us. It is my personal belief that wars do not solve anything, but are a means of aggrandisement, of progressing political aims. Whether there would be a war if there was no oil in Iraq is a fundamental question. My belief is that if Iraq only grew bananas or corn nobody would be the least bit interested in the country. What we see on our television screens every night is the reality, these awful, chilling, horrific pictures of innocent people who have died, particularly children and women, brought to us by embedded reporters in the various media. I do not say it is a bad thing that we have this coverage because it is important that people see the realities of war and that war is not just a Playstation game that children play on their computer screens. It is real and real people are dying.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I and other Members of the House received through our e-mail images of the war which came from some of the Arab stations, and what is being done to human beings by the munitions that have been used is really horrific. What we do not see is what is going on and what has gone on for a long time in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein. His regime has certainly been an evil and unacceptable one. He is not a democrat. He has no ballot box. He has his rifle and his death squads. He has nothing whatsoever to recommend him.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">It is important that Ireland has played a very significant role in the United Nations as peacekeepers, as the Minister for Defence obviously acknowledged, that it has been accepted in all parts of the world whether Christian, Muslim or Hindu. If Irish troops are needed as peacekeepers they are there and they are respected and wanted. They play a significant and important role. We must keep that role in the world and within the United Nations. Our role in history, the role of our Army has been a peacekeeping role. The Government, which has our support on this issue in the context of bringing humanitarian aid to Iraq, must insist with all pressure in all possible ways that the primacy of the United Nations be established again in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">America and Britain are not listening to the United Nations when they are prosecuting the war, but the question of humanitarian aid must not be left to the combatants. Yesterday, the aid agencies made it clear that this must not be done, that humanitarian aid must not be carried out by the British or the Americans. It is extremely worthwhile that the ship <i>Sir Galahad</i> went into the port in Iraq to deliver aid, but the images we saw on television of soldiers firing pistols in the air to control the crowd who were looking for food and water is not acceptable. Neither is it acceptable that the people prosecuting the war should be the ones giving the aid. The Minister, Deputy Kitt, must be given the full authority of this State to put that view forward as strongly and as firmly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">It is very difficult for young people, particularly children, to watch television these days, although I accept it is good that the war is shown on television because it enables us to see, know, feel and understand what is happening there. However it frightens very young children and it really is awful that children are being brought up in a world where they have to see images of real events as they happen which are literally "in your face".</p>
          <p eId="para_960">We are a caring country. The Minister has been given a mandate to prosecute the humanitarian case at the United Nations and he has our full support in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_539">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_961">This has been a very valuable debate. I have listened carefully to the wide-ranging concerns which have been expressed here today by all the speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">During our time on the Security Council the Government worked hard in support of the international efforts to avert conflict. It is a matter of regret that these efforts did not succeed. We also contributed, as has been acknowledged, to the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1441 which offered Iraq a last opportunity to bring itself into compliance with its obligations. However, war is here and that is the terrible reality. We hope the participants will make every effort to minimise loss of life, particularly by sparing the civilian population from the worst consequences of military action. We urge all combatants to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">It is clear from the statements made by Members of this House today that we must as a nation assist to the greatest extent possible in ameliorating the suffering of those most affected by the conflict. We must focus on saving the lives of the most vulnerable sections of the Iraqi population, mainly women and children, the elderly and the disabled. I reassure the House that the Government's primary focus will, as always, be on the most vulnerable sections of the population and especially on those whose capacity to cope has been severely eroded over the years. The Government acted promptly in responding to the humanitarian crisis which is unfolding before our eyes. Ahead of many of the governments who have yet to indicate levels of assistance, our Government announced last week a significant emergency humanitarian funding package of €5 million with a particular emphasis on the needs of women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, and his officials have been working closely with Irish NGOs and international agencies which are best placed to assess needs and to deliver the services required. They have the capacity and experience to respond effectively. Grants totalling €1.5 million are currently being disbursed to UNICEF, ICRC and IFRC for their emergency appeals. Further disbursements will be made shortly on the basis of proposals submitted by the NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I agree with those Members who said that the horrors of this war and their portrayal on television is akin to a high technology virtual reality event. The reality is that war is brutal and cruel and innocent victims get caught up in it. With the outbreak of hostilities the humanitarian situation in Iraq is becoming more difficult with every passing day and we are seeing the atrocities at first hand through the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The challenges facing the international community in dealing with this humanitarian crisis are formidable but they can and must be met. We have gained valuable experience and lessons from similar humanitarian situations, most recently in Afghanistan. The key lesson is that co-ordination between all the agencies and NGOs is essential for effective humanitarian relief. The principal focus of the Government's attention for now will be on assisting the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and these needs are of a breathtaking scale. It is difficult to find a precedent for the volume of food aid which must be supplied if large sections of the Iraqi population are to avoid starvation.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">I believe that effective UN co-ordination of a civilian-led humanitarian effort must be established as soon as conditions allow. Many Members of the House have echoed this view in this debate. The world needs an effective United Nations. In the weeks to come, the people of Iraq and the wider region will need the support and assistance which only a united and cohesive United Nations can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The unanimous decision of the Security Council, through Resolution 1472, authorising the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme for the next 45 days and possibly longer is welcome at this time. I hope that the resumption of the programme will mean that despite the difficulties, basic food assistance can once again reach those who are most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">The issue of neutrality in the delivery of humanitarian assistance is of primary importance and safe and secure access to ensure that humanitarian assistance is delivered in a neutral and impartial way must prevail. Military forces should do everything they can to create an enabling environment for this. There is a need to provide humanitarian space for the UN and NGOs to operate effectively and I hope this will be provided in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Recent scenes of food being thrown off the back of military trucks are an object lesson in how not to deliver humanitarian assistance. Only specialised agencies can identify those who are most in need, and only these agencies with their vast experience have the capacity to deliver assistance effectively. The Government will continue to play its part in helping these agencies to carry out their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">In addition to direct casualties, the conflict will bring great destruction and dislocation. There is no doubt that we will face a grave humanitarian emergency during and after the conflict. Ireland stands ready in assisting the people of Iraq in recovering from this emergency. We are in a position to respond rapidly and to support the international effort to deal with this crisis as it develops. We will work hard to ensure that assistance reaches the most vulnerable and those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The humanitarian situation will call for united action by the entire international community so that the long-suffering people of Iraq can recover from the consequences of the immediate crisis with the shortest possible delay. With such support, we hope to see the people of Iraq make a rapid transition to the reconstruction of their country after years of suffering from conflict and sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Ireland believes that the UN should be at the heart of the reconstruction process. It has the experience, capacity and perceived neutrality to carry this objective forward. Its work in East Timor and Afghanistan is perceived as having been successful. The European Union also believes that the UN must play a central role during and after the current crisis. The House can be assured that every consideration will be given to any request for assistance from members of the Defence Forces in a peacekeeping mission under UN mandate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_540">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_974">I wish to share my time with Deputy Durkan. The Fine Gael motion before the House is a worthy and decent one and my party will support it fully. There is something wrong, very wrong indeed, about a Government that is willing on the one hand to support a motion like this, and on the other to continue to facilitate the activities that make such a call on our humanitarian instincts. As we speak, the casualties of this war on both sides can still apparently be counted in the hundreds, but we have no reliable information about the indirect fall-out. The battle for Baghdad city has yet to begin, the decisions about who should be bombed to secure a surrender have yet to be made. It is inevitable that the casualties will mount into the thousands.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">People are dying in the most horrible ways and from everything we know, these are a people already weak, already with a high mortality rate among children, already very vulnerable. People fled from Baghdad before the war started, but these surely were the lucky ones, the ones with sufficient affluence to be able to do it. Those left behind are in a poor position to fend for themselves, let alone to defend themselves. They are ruled by a tyrant, a man for whom surely they have no love. However, the signs are that they are willing nevertheless to fight and die to defend their country from invasion, as they see it. We have yet to see any evidence that these are a people waiting with bated breath for liberation, waiting for the opportunity to strew rose petals under the tracks of the tanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">We are debating the humanitarian needs of these people. We cannot do so, in my view, without including the most humanitarian thing our Government could do. If our Government is serious about the suffering, the pain, the injuries and deaths that are mounting every day, then it will reverse its policy of facilitating and supporting this war. However, our Government seems incapable even of expressing a view.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">In today's newspapers we read of an American plan that all aid should be distributed in Iraq – even in post-war Iraq – under American military supervision. The conqueror will reserve the right to decide who deserves aid, and presumably who does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Government backbenchers have expressed the view, quite rightly, that a policy of that sort is an affront to the humanitarian spirit. The Taoiseach, however, has nothing to say on the subject and the same backbenchers look the other way. Neither has he anything to say when it is put to him that even a small country like ours not only has a duty to try to stop this illegitimate war, but can actually offer a lead in doing so. Under the rules of the United Nations, countries like Ireland can call for the General Assembly to be brought into session to discuss the war and the stage it has reached. This mechanism, known as Procedure 377, is designed specifically for those moments when the Security Council has failed, for one reason or another, to secure a position that can maintain the peace. I have put it to the Taoiseach in this House that he should, on behalf of Ireland, invoke Procedure 377. On behalf of Ireland he should lead the way in insisting that the world community be heard on this grave issue. He should be standing up at every opportunity for the voice of the United Nations to once again intervene. It may not succeed in stopping the war because, after all, Mr. Rumsfeld has made it clear that nothing will stop the war but the head of Saddam Hussein. However, it is surely vital that the voice of the United Nations not be stilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Our Government, of course, supports the UN and it will issue a platitudinous statement a day to reassure us on that score. It will just not do anything to give expression to that support or to substantiate it. Our Government is against the war, and opposed to suffering of all kinds. More platitudes are issued every day in case we would ever doubt it. It just will not do anything to stop the war, or to express any unease to our friends and neighbours about the way it is being conducted.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">This war is being fought on the basis of principles that have no place in a democratic world. The precedents being established here such as the principle of pre-emptive war owe nothing to any concept of democracy I know of. There is a scene in one or other of the TV shows, perhaps "Hill Street Blues", where the senior station master says each evening, "Do it to them before they do it to you."  The view of the world that enables national and international policy to be developed in accordance with first-strike tactics like that is a worrying one.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I have tried on several occasions to get the Government to agree that pre-emptive war is a dangerous and unacceptable principle, but without success. Instead the Taoiseach has developed a new side-step which argues that because the US, UK and Australia "wrote separately to the President of the Security Council informing him that military action has been taken", this somehow makes it all right. Similarly, the Government is unable to find itself in a position where it might have to condemn, or even mildly disagree with, the notion of regime change.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">We know now that the war is not about liberation. It does not appear anymore to be about weapons of mass destruction, proven links to established terrorists, providing stability in a troubled region or extending the values of democracy and justice to people who have been long denied them. This is a war being fought to construct a scenario that is congenial to American interests now and in the future. We know from the documents published by key participants in the war that it is about establishing American pre-eminence wherever that needs to be done. Humanitarianism comes last in the list of objectives implicit in that policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Ireland will stand ready, as it always has, to help the suffering and maimed when the war is over. This time, perhaps, we will go about our humanitarian tasks with a slight sense of shame that has never been there before. We could have done more to avoid a facilitation of the war.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_541">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_984">I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on bringing the motion before the House at this time. I thank the Minister of State and the Government for bringing about a situation whereby the motion is being agreed. It is symbolic that agreement is reached on this issue at this time. It is unfortunate that the same degree of unanimity did not occur in the debate a couple of weeks ago in regard to the war itself. It appears that those of us on this side of the House were correct in our assessment at the time. However, we will live and learn. I thank, in particular, Deputy Rabbitte and the Labour Party for their support and encouragement to my party leader. Likewise, my thanks to Deputy Ó Caoláin and Sinn Féin for their kind support, Deputy Sargent on behalf of the Green Party and all the Independent Deputies who supported the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The stark reality has now begun to dawn on everyone. Various pundits predicted the outcome of the war, the length of time it would take to come to an end and so on. It now transpires that this is reality. It is not a TV soap, it is real people, real bullets and real injuries, and there are no miraculous recoveries the following day. Nothing extraordinary happens and real pain is being suffered by real people. It brings home to all of us the tragic reality of war and emphasises the need to ensure in future that in the event of something like this occurring again – I hope it will not occur in our time – all other means will be used to resolve it rather than go down the route of the US and its colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">I thank all those who contributed to the debate. It brought home to the House the sentiments privately and publicly expressed in the past by various people on different sides of the House. I want to dwell for a moment on what is likely to take place now and congratulate the Minister on his humanitarian work in the past. However, a new challenge is about to be presented. This is a new era. Something like this has not happened in our time to the same extent. Ireland can now play a major role in influencing internationally the level and degree of humanitarian aid and the efficacy of that aid in a war. We have achieved a great deal of expertise in this area in the past which we can now bring to the fore. We can use it to good effect in influencing others to assist.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I do not want to go over the various points made by people in the House in the past 24 hours, particularly in relation to dispensing humanitarian aid from the back of a truck to all and sundry. That image on television screens throughout the world does not inspire confidence, to say the least. I sincerely hope that the Minister will use his influence to ensure an end is brought to that type of haphazard reaction to what is a very tragic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The other thing that needs to be established at this time is the primacy of the UN in this arena. The UN had already established itself to a great extent in this area in the past, not just in the Middle East but in the Balkans, Africa and various other locations throughout the world. It is important from the point of view of restoring the confidence the UN had in the past to give it the support it deserves to carry out the work that is currently needed. The inspiration to continue can only come from countries like Ireland and from Parliaments which have taken the decision this Parliament has taken. It is imperative at this stage that the Minister use his influence with the European Union to bring about a change in thinking so that the UN and EU's roles can be restored to the primacy they had previously. If that does not happen, there will be a further erosion of the confidence each country had in the UN and, laterally, in the EU. That can have nothing other than the most serious consequences for world peace. It will have much wider implications than anything we have witnessed or anticipated so far. Now is the time for this country to impose its influence in a positive and meaningful way on its colleagues in the UN and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">As we sit here tonight bombs are falling on Baghdad and other locations throughout Iraq. People are being killed, guns are being fired and the smell of death and destruction is everywhere. The least we can do is offer whatever sustenance we can by way of humanitarian aid and influence to try to bring about an end to the war as quickly as possible. The longer the war continues, the greater will become the need and degree of destruction. As this debate comes to an end, I hope that in some small way we have been able to influence the remainder of what is a truly tragic situation. At this stage all we can ask is that the Minister use his influence in the various locations to bring about an end to the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I convey the thanks of my party leader to each Member of the House who contributed to the debate and to the Government for facilitating unanimous acceptance of the motion.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_542">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_991">I join with Deputy Crawford in making what is a very important appeal to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is represented here this evening, to exercise all possible energies and explore all possible avenues to help save the CPV, Container Pressure Vessels, plant in Clones, County Monaghan, and the current workforce of 85 people. The people of Clones and County Monaghan are devastated by the news that broke only in the past 24 hours, indicating that the workforce would be made redundant and that a negotiation process between the parent company of CPV, Terex Corporation, and a proposed new company to take over the plant, had failed. The 85 workers have been laid off, but that figure only tells part of the story. At its zenith, this plant employed up to 140 people and would have been the largest manufacturing concern in Clones and one of the largest in County Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">There is a history to this closure. Five days before Christmas, the then workforce of 99 people, their families and the wider community were shocked to learn of the decision by the parent company to close the CPV plant. They recognised their jobs were in jeopardy with a date for final closure set for the past week. It had been known for some time that there were difficulties with the CPV enterprise at Clones, not in relation to its viability or because of relations between management and workforce – far from it – but because of the absence of a commitment on the part of the parent company to regard CPV as an integral part of its wider manufacturing base. It was taken over as part of the bigger Powerscreen take-over by Terex Corporation in recent years and was not a natural element in its focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Earlier last year, as a result of the indications made to us by the management of CPV and Terex representatives, I and other Deputies raised directly with the Minister the difficulties facing the company. We urged her to meet the management and that the various State agencies would employ their best efforts to stave off the final closure. Following the Christmas announcement, to which I referred, I again contacted the Minister's office urging her to act immediately to rescue these crucial jobs for the workforce and the wider community in Clones, for whom this is a devastating economic blow. Shortly afterwards, the management, workforce and community were given hope by the prospect of the company being taken over and the jobs being saved. Only a small number of redundancies occurred, with the result that up to 48 hours ago, more than 80 workers were still in place and hoping and praying for a successful conclusion to the negotiations between the parent company, Terex Corporation, and NT Logic, a new player.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">However, this week came the crunch news that the prospective take-over of the plant by NT Logic had collapsed. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister my appeal and that of Deputy Crawford and all opinion who recognise that the loss of these jobs in Clones, County Monaghan, will have devastating consequences for the workers, their families, the town of Clones and the Border community in County Monaghan. This closure will have consequences similar to what would happen if there was a closure of a plant of proportionate size in Dublin employing thousands or in other major population centres.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_995">I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this vital issue. Like my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, I was shocked to learn the news this week that the negotiations between Terex Corporation and NT Logic had broken down. CPV has had a long and proud record in Clones, a town that has suffered more than any other as a result of the long period of Troubles in Northern Ireland and the Border region. For many years Clones was cut off from its natural hinterland. In spite of these problems, CPV was established and maintained, giving first class employment to people from both sides of the Border. It was a true cross-Border project. Many efforts have been made to establish cross-Border projects to bring together people from both sides of the Border, yet CPV is to be closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">Up to last autumn, CPV gave employment to at least 140 people, but the last 80 employees received their walking papers on Monday, 31 March 2003. All the local people and politicians have worked through the local chamber of commerce in a united and tireless fashion to find an alternative buyer and a straight take-over, thus avoiding redundancies. Major questions arise over how so much work, goodwill and promise failed. Nevertheless, I pay tribute to Terex Corporation personnel, the directors of NT Logic and others at the ABN-AMRO group for their openness and frankness.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must ensure that every possible effort and commitment is given to any potential group or individuals who will reopen this plant. Orders are still available and new products can be produced by the factory to provide much needed environmentally friendly products. Enterprise Ireland can give support to provide a new beginning with a long-term future to an Irish based or perhaps even a Monaghan based group. People, many of whom have long experience in this kind of business, are committed and interested. IDA Ireland has a role to play with potential outside interests. However, I favour local involvement, as it has proved in the past to have long-term commitment and pride in maintaining such industry in the local area.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The people in Clones and the wider Border region have received little benefit from the Celtic tiger or the peace process by way of new jobs. The infrastructure, such as roads, railway or broadband, is not the best. The CPV plant stands on the site of the railway station, which has been closed since the middle 1950s. At that time we were promised that roads would be built to replace the railway.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The workers at the plant are of the highest calibre and are capable of doing a first class job. Terex Corporation never saw the pressure tank business as part of its core business and from the outset made clear it was not committed to it. There is an opportunity here. The Minister of State on behalf of the Minister, and the Minister herself, must make a major commitment to this hard pressed Border region. They must make an all-out effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">We could call for the establishment of a task force and consultancy groups, but we do not want that. We simply want the Minister to use the available structures to give whatever financial support she can to reopen this plant. The redundancy payments will be paid this Friday, the doors will close but the plant and machinery will still be there. The personnel and goodwill is available to reopen the factory in the shortest possible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">An insurance issue is involved in this. Part of the downfall of the plant was a problem with insurance. The Tánaiste and her office have a major role to play to ensure this never happens again and that there are bonding and guarantees. The closure could not have happened north of the Border because the plant would have been covered by the state there when the insurance company went bust.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_544">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1002">I thank Deputies Ó Caoláin and Crawford for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I learnt with grave disappointment of the decision by Terex Corporation on 31 March to close its subsidiary, CPV Limited, with the loss of 98 jobs. I am conscious of the effect the closure of this plant will have on Clones and, most immediately, the employees and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">In December 2002, Terex announced that the Clones facility would close unless a suitable buyer could be found by 31 March 2003. In the past three months several parties had expressed interest, most recently NT Logic, a United Kingdom based company. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have maintained contact with the local management and will continue to provide whatever support is most appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">In reaction to the closure announcement at CPV Limited, FÁS, the national training authority, contacted the company to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS is making available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">In terms of finding new investment and providing new sources of employment in Monaghan, I am determined to do everything I can to see that this happens. The State agencies continue to aggressively market the area, which forms part of the Border, midland and west region which is a priority location for jobs promotion by the agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The agencies are also committed to bringing about balanced regional development, with IDA Ireland having a target of locating 50% of all new greenfield investment in the Objective One region. The availability of suitable premises and a committed and motivated workforce are major selling points.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment and encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential. Enterprise Ireland, as part of its regional development, also encourages Dublin-based companies to locate their business expansions in the BMW region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">In addition, Enterprise Ireland is actively promoting the Lough Egish food park for any companies which are considering locating to the region. The park is a flagship project to attract food companies to the region. A number of companies are already located there and negotiations are ongoing for the new start-up businesses in the prepared consumer foods sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The designation of Monaghan town as a hub in the national spatial strategy will drive its development within County Monaghan and help to capitalise on the town's strategic position within the overall Border area. There is emphasis in the national spatial strategy on building upon the strong small and medium enterprise base in the central part of the Border area to extend the diversification of employment. The national spatial strategy will utilise the network of towns in Monaghan and strengthen their ability to provide a wide range of service functions for their hinterland areas and act as further economic drivers in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The State development agencies under the aegis of my Department will continue to market County Monaghan for investment and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by the closure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1013">As a result of the over-subscription to the special beef premium by farmers which has led to a national quota overrun, beef farmers are set to take a severe cut of 20% on special beef premium and extensification payments this year. This overrun is as a direct result of the 47,000 premium rights lost by Ireland at the Luxembourg Farm Council meeting in June 2001. As a result of this and with the leaking of the document from the Fischler mid-term review proposals in early December which stated that 2002 would be a reference year for the calculation of the proposed single decoupling payment, there was a 37% increase in the number of applications for the special beef premium in December 2002 compared with December 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">It was agreed between the Minister and the social partner farm organisations to change the rules in the event of an overshoot in the national quota in 2002 by exempting farmers who applied on fewer than 50 animals from a reduction in payments should the national quota ceiling be exceeded. This agreement must be upheld. As this exempts 50% of animals, a 10% overshoot in the national quota effectively means a 20% reduction in applications on more than 50 animals to bring the total number under the ceiling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Minister for Agriculture and Food must find an immediate solution to prevent 10,000 livestock farmers from suffering a severe €20 million cut in income as a result of the overrun in the special beef premium. Livestock farmers face an average cut of €2,000 in each of their special beef premium applications. This will have a dramatic impact on many farmers, especially full-time farmers. In my constituency, 25% of farmers have left the land since the current parties in government took office almost six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">This 20% cut equates to €46 per head which is over the profit made on the animal. Some 50% of the premium is gone at the time the animal is purchased in the first place. As a consequence, many farmers will be hit severely, especially finishers who will be put out on the road. Farmers need much more than 50 animals to be commercially viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Political intervention is required between the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Commissioner. The Minister must find a solution to this special beef premium fiasco, especially given that it is a direct result of two issues outside the control of farmers: the Luxembourg beef premium quota cut and confusion caused by a leaked document from the Fischler proposals on what would be the base year. This leak alone caused a 70% overrun in the number of applications submitted in 2002. That was outside the control of farmers. Action needs to be taken now by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_548">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1018">I thank Deputy Naughten for sharing his valuable time. When farmers read the eligibility regulations when applying for the special beef premium in 2002, there was nothing to suggest that there would be a 22% clawback on any premium. The most people expected was a 9% clawback and I understand that all farmers were agreeable to that. I do not need to tell the Minister of State, given the part of the world from where he comes, that if full-time farmers, especially winter fatteners, are surcharged to the tune of 22%, this will put them out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I do not understand why the senior Minister is so slow in devising an answer to this. I will not go back over what Deputy Naughten said because he outlined the case very well. Surely there must be a system whereby the aggregate applications for even the two years 2002 and 2003 could counterbalance each other. Everyone knows that the number of animals applied for under the special beef premium this year will fall far short of last year. It is against that background that the Fischler announcement just before Christmas put the kibosh on the matter. The year 2002 was a year of record payments and every farmer knew that if he or she did not make the application he or she would lose out for a lifetime. No farmer could be blamed for doing that. I ask the Minister of State to convey to his senior Minister, with whose inaction on this matter many farmers are unhappy, that something can be done about it. This is not rocket science. I put it to the Minister of State that there is no beef farmer in this country who can take a 22% cut in his or her special beef premium. That is just not on. There are few beef farmers there already but this will drive them out altogether.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamAylward" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_549">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</from>
          <p eId="para_1020">I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this Adjournment debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">By way of background to the issue, I want to explain the context that has given rise to an overshoot on the special beef premium in 2002. Ireland's quota for special beef premiums was set at 1.077 million quota rights as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement and came into effect in 2000. As part of the decisions to bring the quota into effect, and to ensure that Irish farmers maximised their entitlements under the new arrangements, the Minister decided, after consultations with the main farming organisations, to apply the flexibility afforded by the regulations to target the application of the premiums rights in a manner best suited to Irish conditions. There was general acceptance of the need to tailor the quota in a manner that guaranteed the optimum take up of quota rights and consequently of premium entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Two decisions were taken in conformity with the views of the farm organisations. First, to increase the number of animals on which premiums could be applied from 90 to 180. The effect of this decision meant that farmers could apply on 360 animals in total, thereby facilitating the maximisation of the quota. Second, to apply an exemption for smaller farmers with up to 50 animals so that such farmers would not have their applications reduced, and their income for that matter, in the event that an overshoot on the national quota arose in any given year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">In the event there was no overshoot in 2000 nor indeed was there any overshoot in 2001. In fact the number of applications in each of these two years was about 3% below quota and therefore no reduction in premium entitlements for either of the two categories of producer arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">However, in 2001 as part of a mini reform of the beef sector, which came about in an effort to restore market balance which had been adversely affected by the occurrence of BSE in mainland Europe, all member states had their quota rights reduced. In the case of Ireland the quota cut amounted to 49,305 quota rights. This resulted in a new national quota of 1.028 million. To a large extent this reduction was based on earlier years' utilisation of quota and the value of the decision to increase the headage limit to 180 ensured that Ireland's new quota arising from the mini reform was protected to the best possible extent. I point out that had we maintained the previous headage limit at 90, the level of utilisation in 2000 and 2001 would have been much lower and this would have resulted in a greater reduction in quota rights than was actually imposed. This new quota came into effect in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The Minister was conscious nonetheless that circumstances might arise that would lead to an overshoot in 2002, particularly when it became clear that live exports for the year had not resumed at reasonable levels and that suckler cow numbers had not declined as much as might have been expected in response to the various measures in Agenda 2000 designed to reduce production. It became evident as the year progressed that an overshoot was in sight and the Department actively addressed this issue in a variety of ways to highlight the potential risk and to promote moderation in the number of applications submitted. I wish to acknowledge the role of the farm organisations in this respect and also indeed of the advisory services. As the year came to a close we were confident that no overshoot would arise or that it would be contained at modest levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">However, we had not anticipated, nor could it have been predicted, that draft Commission proposals for the mid-term review would be leaked before the end of 2002. Details were published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of 28 December 2002 and the aspect of particular relevance to beef producers was the designation of 2002 as one of the three reference years for the purposes of establishing entitlement to the single direct payment. This led to a flood of applications in the dying days of 2002 from farmers anxious to ensure they maximised their future income entitlements. These farmers would, in the normal course, have applied in respect of the animals in question, in 2003. However, the temptation to apply earlier led to the consequence that an overshoot of some 11% is expected. This equates to an excess of 114,871 animals over the quota and is close to the number of applications made for first-age and bull premiums in the last two days of the year. There is, therefore, incontrovertible evidence that the overshoot, though it may settle somewhat below 11%, was caused by the flood of applications following the leaked mid-term review proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">This matter has now been brought to the attention of the EU Commission and discussions have been held to explore measures to help alleviate the worst effects of the overshoot. Contacts at official level are ongoing with a view to finding an appropriate mechanism to minimise the impact on farmers. I appreciate what the Deputies have said in the debate so far. There is no easy solution to this problem and the fact is that, as matters stand, there is an absolute limit on the number of quota rights for 2002 and later years and any excess above that will be dealt with according to the rules set down, unless we can agree an alternative mechanism. I assure the Deputies we will continue our endeavours in this regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1028">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising the plight of the Palestinian people and of the international neglect of that issue over the last few years. I have been a supporter of the Palestinian cause for the past 20 years and now that I have been elected to this 29th Dáil I would like to highlight their cause and to urge the Government to take a more pro-active approach at both UN and EU levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The Palestinian people have a right to self-determination and any democrat must support that position. There is massive support in Ireland for the Palestinian cause but we do not use this understanding and sympathy enough to further their case. We need to be more responsive to the serious issues affecting the Palestinian people. It is simply not good enough to say that we sympathise with them but we also need to show solidarity, active support and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">With the war in Iraq, the issue of the Palestinian people has gone off the political agenda. Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair have no genuine concern so it is up to the rest of us and the international community to push the Palestinian agenda. It is a question of justice and equality and above all it is a question of humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Last week I had the honour and privilege of meeting the delegate general of Palestine in Ireland, Ali Halimeh, and I gave a commitment at that meeting to raise the case of the Palestinian people. That is why I raised this matter on the Adjournment. I hope that this debate will assist their cause and motivate the Government to do more internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The Irish people know from history what it is like to be under a foreign power and to be denied the right to self-determination. We have come through a conflict and now we are trying to resolve it through the peace process. This is all the Palestinian people want and we all have a duty to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">It is also important to know and understand the horrific nightmare of the Palestine people. Throughout the current intifada, school children have suffered from increasing exposure to violence, trauma and poverty as well as from confinement and a lack of educational, social and cultural outlets due to the closures and curfews. Palestinians' rights to education have been violated through Israeli military curfews and closures, which prevent students and teachers from reaching their schools as well as the destruction and closure of some schools by the Israeli army. School children have been attacked by the Israeli army and illegal Jewish settlers while travelling to and from their places of study.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Between September 2000 and 2 January 2003 Israeli forces killed 239 Palestinian school children and wounded 2,500 on their way to or from school. Some 166 students and 75 teachers were arrested, 1,289 Palestinian schools were temporarily closed, 197 schools were damaged, 11 schools were completely destroyed, nine schools were vandalised, 25 schools have been taken over by the Israeli occupation forces for use as army barracks and detention centres and 185 schools were shelled by the Israeli defence forces. I ask the Minister to intervene and to bring aid to the Palestinian people. Perhaps he could raise the idea of bringing more graduates and students to Ireland on scholarships.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">This is the horrific situation of the people in the occupied territories. I urge the Government to act on this grave injustice and also to act and support the UN resolutions that have been ignored by the US and Britain. Each day we see the slaughter of the Iraqi people which in itself is a crime against humanity but we should never allow the world to forget the deaths of the Palestinians. We must keep the issue on the international agenda. We have the power to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The vast majority of the Palestinian people want to make peace with their neighbours and it is up to all of us as politicians, particularly in Ireland, with a strong tradition of neutrality to act as a broker and a mover for peace in the Middle East. Now is the time to show courage, vision and leadership and make the rights of the Palestinian people a priority issue in Ireland's foreign policy. People such as Sharon and Bush have nothing to offer their own people and above all they have nothing to offer in international relations. They are war mongers. Eventually the will of the people will win and countries around the world will respect each other's borders and live with the reality of peaceful conflict resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I wish the Prime Minister elect, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, our best wishes and our support for the right of the Palestinian people to exist in peace.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">In thanking Deputy McGrath for raising this important matter on the Adjournment, the Government has not in any way lost sight of the situation in Palestine or the need for international action to bring about a peaceful solution to the long-running conflict there. We are very conscious of the privations which Palestinians suffer in their daily lives under occupation and of the continuing toll of deaths and injuries in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have frequent contact with the senior leadership of the Palestinian Authority, who are in no doubt as to the strength of Ireland's stance. In his contacts with President Arafat the Taoiseach has reaffirmed his personal support for the peace effort, his encouragement for international engagement, including the commitment of the European Council to a two State solution to the conflict as well as our complete rejection of Israel's illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The situation of the Palestinian people is a matter on which Ireland has taken a strong, consistent and principled position over the years. In 1980 Ireland was among the first member states of the European Union to advocate expressly the creation of a Palestinian state and we have worked to advance this aim ever since. The current position of the European Union, support for an independent, viable Palestinian State living in peace and security beside Israel, is in no small measure due to Ireland's energetic advocacy over the past two decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Our support takes practical forms as well. Since 2000 we have had resident diplomatic representation in the Palestinian territories in the form of our representative office in Ramallah. As well as serving as a channel of political communication and a symbol of Irish commitment, this mission oversees the disbursement of Ireland's development and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians. The Government's programme of development assistance delivered through Ireland Aid has a sharp poverty focus with emphasis on humanitarian and emergency assistance. It aims to help the Palestinian people build their institutions and infrastructure in a difficult economic and political environment and strives to ensure that assistance to the Palestinian Authority helps those who are most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">In 2002, the Government delivered total funding of €6.3 million to Palestine. Almost half of this was targeted specifically at meeting the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians directly affected by the conflict. This funding delivered through agencies such as the UN agencies and the Red Cross was in response to emergency appeals for funding for emergency shelter repair and reconstruction, emergency health, food, water and medical supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I assure the Members that whatever the pressures or demands which may arise in connection with the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, we will continue to pay close attention to the needs of the Palestinian people and to provide them with humanitarian and development support. We will continue with our programme of assistance to the Palestinian Authority. At present this is running at €10 million per month in budgetary assistance which will shortly be redirected towards development projects. Ireland's support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights is in no doubt, nor is our commitment to Israel's right to live with secure borders at peace with its neighbours. In this spirit, Ireland's delegation on the UN Security Council worked tirelessly in 2001 and 2002. This is a matter of public record and is widely appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">On the international scene there are also some hopeful signs. The international quartet of the US, Russia, the EU and the UN agreed a road map for a Palestinian state and a comprehensive settlement in December last. This document sets out a phased programme of actions in the political, security, economic and humanitarian areas which will reduce tensions and lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. It establishes independently verifiable benchmarks to be met by both sides. At present, it represents the best hope for a solution to the conflict, which has seen carnage visited on civilians on all sides. Due to the Israeli elections and other circumstances the US has been reluctant to adopt this road map formally and begin its implementation. On 13 March during his meeting in Washington with President Bush the Taoiseach raised the concerns which are widely felt in Europe at the lack of progress on the adoption of the road map. Other European leaders also expressed concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">On 14 March President Bush announced that the road map will be presented to the parties as soon as the new Palestinian Cabinet is formed and approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council. This is expected to happen in the next week or so. It is a matter of fact that serious engagement by the United States is an inevitable prerequisite for any progress on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is recognised by both the Israelis and the Palestinians. We are now seeing signs of this engagement and we shall do all in our power to encourage it. Tomorrow, in Brussels, US Secretary of State Powell will meet EU Ministers to discuss the Middle East peace process. The EU side will again emphasise the need for early adoption of the road map and for sustained and even-handed US engagement in the terms set out in the conclusions of the European Council on 21 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the longest running on the international scene. There are rights and wrongs on both sides and bitter sacrifices will be demanded of all parties if peace is to be achieved. We know from our experience on this island that a peace process cannot produce instant harmony or dispel a legacy of bitterness and mistrust with a handshake or a signature. With the best will in the world, peace will not be established overnight by the international community. It is, in the final analysis, a commitment of trust which the parties themselves must make. Should they choose to make that commitment they will not find international support lacking. Ireland, as always, will be prominent among the states offering support for a commitment to peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this important subject.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_95">The provisions relating to participation of members of the Defence Forces in overseas missions are set out in the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State, as part of a particular international United Nations force. Where the number of armed troops exceeds 12, the approval of Dáil Éireann is also required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">This means that participation in an overseas operation requires UN authorisation, a specific Government decision and where the level of participation is to exceed 12, the approval of Dáil Éireann.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">The takeover from NATO by the EU of the military operation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, represents the first EU military mission to take place under the European security and defence policy. The operation is one of a range of EU support measures aimed at brining FYROM closer to EU standards and principles in the context of ongoing support to the peace and stabilisation process in FYROM and implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement. One of the key tasks of the operation will be to provide support to international monitors and other international actors in FYROM. Ireland already has a significant presence with EU and OSCE monitoring missions in the western Balkans including the current head of the EU monitoring mission, ambassador Anton Mac Unfraidh.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Having regard to United Nations Resolution 1371 dated 26 September 2001 and the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 to which I have referred, the Government was advised that participation by the Defence Forces in this mission was not covered by national legislation. I should clarify in this regard, that while Resolution 1371 welcomes international efforts, including the efforts of the EU to support the implementation of the Ohrid peace agreement, it does not authorise an international United Nations force as required by the Defence Acts. I might add that this is a small operation involving 300 to 350 personnel for which there are more than sufficient offers of participation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">This is a unique situation and I expect that future EU Petersberg Task missions will have the required UN authorisation thereby enabling the Government to consider Defence Forces participation on a case by case basis.</summary>

      asked the

      when it is intended to acquire medium lift helicopters, following the cancellation of the order in 2002 and in view of the clear need for appropriate aircraft to allow the Air Corps to carry out its duties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1070">The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002 was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced. Any decision to acquire medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in the future can only be taken as the financial resources permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. However, having consulted the military authorities in the matter at that time the main priority outlined for the Air Corps was the purchase of fixed-wing training aircraft to ensure that cadets continued to be commissioned, trained as pilots and retained in the Air Corps. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract with Pilatus of Switzerland in January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propeller training aircraft which will be delivered in 2004. The value of the contract, including VAT, is around €60 million. These aircraft are a very realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at the current time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">An interdepartmental working group was established to seek alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. I expect the group to report in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I am committed to maintaining the Air Corps role in the provision of SAR services and, in this regard, an S61 helicopter has been acquired for the Air Corps to operate in the north west region as a replacement for the Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHCI pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is currently ongoing. It was anticipated that the helicopter would go operational in early 2003 but due to a delay in securing appropriate training personnel it is now forecast that the S61 will commence on site training at Sligo airport this month with operations commencing in June 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1079">In 2002 a total of 4,234 applications were received for consideration for positions in the Permanent Defence Force. Of this figure, 2,750 were applications for general service recruitment. As a result 500 general service recruits were enlisted of whom 93 were subsequently discharged. Of the 93 discharged, 89 were discharged by purchase and the reasons they gave for leaving varied from taking up civilian employment, returning to education, unsuited to military life, domestic/family or no reason given. The remaining recruits did not successfully complete recruit training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">In 2003 to date 1,794 applications have been received for positions in the Permanent Defence Force of which 652 were for general service recruitment. As a result, to date this year, 36 general service recruits have been enlisted. At present 108 recruits are in training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">The number of applications received for cadetships in 2002 and 2003 was 1,047 and 1,111 respectively. As a result of the 2002 cadetship competition 71 cadets were enlisted. The cadetship competition 2003 is currently ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Some 143 applications were received for apprenticeships in the Air Corps and, as a result, 17 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted on 23 September 2002. The 2003 Air Corps apprenticeship competition was advertised on 23 March 2003 and the closing date for receipt of applications is 15 April 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">In 2002 a total of 294 applications were received for direct entry competitions for appointments for medical officers, engineers, ordnance corps officers, watchkeeping officers, engine room officers, electrical and engine room artificers in the Naval Service and instrumentalists in the Army School of Music. As a result, 27 direct entry officers, 15 electrical and engine room artificers and eight instrumentalists were appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Direct entry competitions for appointments for medical officers, engineers, watchkeeping officers, engine room officers, engine room artificers in the Naval Service and instrumentalists in the Army School of Music are currently being held. To date in 2003 a total of 31 applications have been received for these direct entry competitions. As a result, eight direct entry officers have been appointed. The selection process in respect of these competitions is ongoing and it is expected that there will be further appointments this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1086">The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was commented upon by the Gleeson commission in its report in 1990. The matter had also been of serious concern to the military authorities for a number of years. The age profile was also the subject of severe criticism by PriceWaterhouse Consultants who had been engaged by the efficiency audit group, EAG, to conduct an in-depth study of the Defence Forces. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis with a Reserve Defence Force commitment of seven years. The recruitment of personnel on five year contracts was introduced following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994 provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12 years. Any extension was subject to the individual soldier meeting certain criteria to include standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for junior and senior non-commissioned officers. The new policy represented a substantial improvement for personnel who would otherwise have had to leave after five years service while continuing to address the issues of age profile and fitness levels in the Defence Forces. I am satisfied with these existing arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">PDFORRA recently submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. As discussions on issues raised under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties concerned the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1104">The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to large-scale emergencies. As chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, my approach is that such responses should be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. The task force continues to monitor and review issues concerning large-scale emergencies and potential threats from international terrorism. While the current threat assessment is not a cause for concern, the awareness that the situation could change rapidly, and with little warning, determines that vigilance is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The office of emergency planning, in my Department, co-ordinates the responses by the various agencies involved and continues to exercise an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The existing lead roles of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements continue. I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the task force, the office of emergency planning and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The office of emergency planning continues to provide a key support to the task force and co-ordinates the work of the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism. The general increase in awareness surrounding emergency planning and response issues is welcome and an encouragement to the ongoing work. The current situation in Iraq is one which continues to be monitored by appropriate agencies here.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1107">First, I welcome the recent endorsement by both employers and unions of the Sustaining Progress national partnership agreement. I believe that this agreement will yield many social benefits and that the pay rises will enhance living standards as the downward pressure on inflation continues. Ireland currently stands at the crossroads between maintaining the huge progress of recent years and seeing the erosion of business and employment; this agreement will also give Irish business the opportunity to restore competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">As I have informed the House on a number of previous occasions, members of the Defence Forces are prohibited from belonging to trade unions and, as a consequence, their representative associations are not affiliated to ICTU. This means that the associations do not participate directly in the negotiations between the social partners which have led to national agreements. In the course of discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, agreement was reached with the Defence Forces representative associations on a framework which would facilitate them engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the social partners at national level. Under the terms of this agreement, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Defence and the military authorities met collectively and separately with representatives of PDFORRA and RACO. These meetings were supplemented by a number of bilateral meetings involving the various parties. This process ensured that the associations were fully aware of developments at the central discussions while at the same time having a forum to raise matters of particular concern to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Based on the established model, parallel discussions with the Defence Forces representative associations on how the public service benchmarking body's recommendations on achieving modernisation, flexibility and change can be implemented in the Defence Forces commenced on 22 October 2002 and are continuing. In the expectation of a successful conclusion to those discussions and that the Defence Forces representative associations will accept the Sustaining Progress agreement, an allocation of €14 million has been made in the revised 2003 Estimate for my Department. This allocation provides for payment of the benchmarking awards, including the arrears due from 1 December 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1113">I welcome the opportunity to report to the House on discussions which took place at the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Greece on 14 and 15 March last. A number of such informal meetings have been held in recent years. The meetings have been a useful forum for promoting dialogue between Defence Ministers in the context of the development of ESDP structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">While the thrust of the agenda in Greece related to progressing ESDP, the meeting took place against the background of the deepening crisis in relation to Iraq which has subsequently led to war. The Iraqi crisis was the subject of a discussion held in closed session at the meeting. While I do not wish to breach the confidentiality of the discussion, the national positions of the various member states have been well publicised. In the current climate, it is crucial that those with differing opinions and viewpoints on this very serious crisis maintain continued dialogue.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_108">This year is an important year for ESDP as it is the target date for achieving the Helsinki headline goal, namely, the development of a capability to deploy within 60 days, and sustain for at least one year, up to 60,000 persons capable of carrying out Petersberg task operations, namely, crisis management operations, peace support operations and humanitarian tasks. Deputies will be aware that much progress has already been achieved at EU level in relation to the development of the headline goal capabilities. The focus of our discussion in this respect was the modalities for filling some outstanding capability shortfalls. In this regard, Ministers concluded that a pragmatic way forward is to establish project groups to deal with each of the most important shortfalls and with a view towards achieving some further progress before a capabilities conference, which will be held in Brussels in May. As with all aspects of ESDP, the conclusions in this regard recognise the voluntary nature of ESDP.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">Other subjects discussed were an initiative of the Greek Presidency in relation to consultations with the European Commission to generate a dialogue on the defence industry among member states. The Presidency also provided updates in relation to their initiative to host a workshop, in conjunction with the EU Commission, regarding the Commission's Green Paper on space. The Presidency also reported on its initiative to develop a common training programme for civilian and military staff dealing with ESDP issues.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1116">Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation, where personnel have access to firearms, are too obvious to require elaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">A compulsory substance testing programme was introduced on 1 February 2002 as part of a Defence Forces substance abuse programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces representative associations. Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new compulsory random drug testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the sanctions for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug free environment within the Defence Forces.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">The primary objective of compulsory random drugs testing is deterrence. In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained drugs testing team will be responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14 November 2002 and it is envisaged that 10% of the Defence Forces will be randomly tested per annum. A member, randomly selected, may be required, at any time, to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, or the abuse or misuse of other substances, or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member who refuses to provide a urine sample, or who provides a urine sample which tests positive, shall be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force regulations. A total of 520 members from all ranks have been tested to date, comprising 85 commissioned officers, 200 non-commissioned officers and 235 privates or equivalents. There have been two positive tests.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1122">Planning for major accidents and emergencies has been ongoing for many years. This has been carried out at local level and co-ordinated on a regional basis in accordance with the Government major emergency planning framework. The Government task force on emergency planning requested all authorities to review their emergency plans and develop new ones where appropriate.

          <p eId="para_1156">A draft integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The IPMS will encompass a new career development plan.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The requirements which the IPMS must meet are set out in chapter 4.5 of the White Paper on defence. The focus is on ensuring the availability of military personnel with the appropriate skills to undertake whatever tasks the State requires. In this regard, the IPMS will try to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice to the benefit of the organisation and of the people in it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dignity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement, and pensions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">Within that broad context, it is intended that there would be a career development plan for all Defence Forces personnel. It is important to note that the issues which the IPMS must address are very complex and that the details, including the details of the career development plan, have yet to be finalised and agreed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">I do not want, in anything I say, to pre-empt the discussions taking place in the strategic management committee. However, I can say in a general way that a career development plan would seek to ensure that people joining the Defence Forces are aware of the career opportunities available to them and are also aware of the standards to be reached and maintained.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">The plan would be designed to give to all personnel the right blend of skills training, education, work assignments and experience to equip them to carry out their tasks, to enhance the quality of their work life and to enable them to compete for promotion opportunities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_121">Also, there would be an updated performance management system and performance appraisal and feedback which would have an appropriate element of career guidance and management built into it. All personnel, whether officers or enlisted personnel, would be covered by the plan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">As I mentioned already, the IPMS is being discussed by the strategic management committee. Once these discussions are completed, I expect that a final draft of the IPMS will be submitted to me. Before any final decisions are taken, it is my intention that the Defence Forces representative associations will be fully consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation. I hope to see the IPMS finalised later this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1169">My position on this matter has not changed since I replied to this question six weeks ago. For the Deputy's benefit, I will repeat what I stated on 19 February last, namely that to amend the Defence Act in order to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">I know PDFORRA has placed a certain stress on the concept of the soldier as a "citizen in uniform" with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. The position is that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, <i>inter alia,</i> a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. Taking any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">I am satisfied the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme – with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussion during national pay talks – provide a framework within which issues of concern can, are and should continue to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1220">I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 119 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces has been a key focus for me since my appointment to the defence portfolio. Significant investment has taken place and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their day to day roles at home and overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">However, while much has been done both on the equipment and the infrastructure front, I am aware that more needs to be done. While expenditure programmes will now have to be prioritised due to the changed financial situation, I will ensure that a substantive re-equipment programme will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">One example is the position with regard to the acquisition of APCs for the Defence Forces. The original APC contract contained an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract in December, 2002 for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of €33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation. On delivery, the Defence Forces will have a total of 65 APCs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">There has been significant investment on new vehicles for the Defence Forces including specialist transport cargo vehicles and on new troop carrying vehicles and 0.75 ton trucks. More than €13 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. Ongoing programmes include the acquisition of additional night vision equipment and nuclear biological chemical, NBC, equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. In that regard, I was delighted to sign a contract on 16 January 2003 for the supply of eight turbo propellor training aircraft to replace the Siai Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the aircraft is approximately €60 million. Delivery of the aircraft will take place during 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1292">Against a background of increasing concern about the possible link between scrapie in sheep and BSE, and in the absence of any horizontal EU rules in relation to the control and eradication of scrapie, I introduced a depopulation policy for sheep flocks infected with scrapie in December 2001. This was one element of an overall policy which has included also the elements of greatly increased testing and further evaluation of genotyping.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Those whose flocks were depopulated were prohibited from re-stocking with sheep for a period of two years after depopulation and a compensation package, including an element for the capital value of the flock and an element for loss of profit, was negotiated with the IFA. Since then the question of how best to control and eradicate scrapie has received considerable attention at EU level. These deliberations have resulted in the recent publication of a Commission regulation providing for a number of options for dealing with scrapie infected flocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">These include full depopulation, with restocking with sheep prohibited for three years, or partial depopulation of scrapie susceptible animals, with various post-slaughter restrictions on re-stocking and sales. My Department is at present evaluating the new regulation and considering how best to proceed. The current policy will be adjusted as necessary in the best interests of consumers and the Irish sheep sector. While we are still considering the detail of possible adjustments to current policy and practice in this area, it is fair to say that I anticipate significant developments in that regard in the course of the year.</p>

The EU has very recently moved to introduce rules which provide for a number of options, including full depopulation, in relation to dealing with scrapie. My Department is currently reviewing existing policy in light of these new rules to determine the extent of any adjustments which might be desirable or necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_1343">As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on a new programme of decentralisation. It is vital that all involved are consulted, whether the staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">Given the wide range of considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on this matter. However, the Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies and all of the submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, including those received on behalf of County Wexford, will be taken into account as part of the deliberative process.</p>

The Tenby police explained that lock flick knives are listed as prohibited weapons in Britain. As a consequence, and in accordance with UK law, the individual was formally cautioned about his possession of such a weapon and samples were taken of his fingerprints and DNA. I understand that a record of this caution remains on the British police national computer for five years and that, unless some different police issue arises for the individual, it should not cause him any difficulty travelling to Britain.</p>

          <p eId="para_1372">The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the 2002 NESF report on early school leaving estimated that on a national basis, approximately 1,000 children are in this category.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which came into effect on 5 July 2002, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service, with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body – the National Educational Welfare Board. The Act requires schools considering the expulsion of a student to notify the educational welfare officer 20 school days prior to the expulsion. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_142">The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning amongst the students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student; suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than 20 days in an academic year or expels a student from the school. An independent appeals mechanism is in place to deal with section 29 appeals. Under the Act, an appeal must be dealt with within 30 days with a provision for a 14 day extension to this period if required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">To date, there have been three appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 in relation to expulsions in County Wexford schools. Two of these were resolved at facilitation and one appeal was not upheld.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases where, for whatever reason including expulsion, a pupil is without a mainstream school place and the parents or guardian seek my Departments assistance. This can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with schools and through the inspectorate to assist his or her placement in another school. There are no placement cases currently in progress at post primary level in Wexford.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_146">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Education Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. Under section 21 of the Act, principals of recognised schools are required to maintain, in respect of each school year, an attendance record for each pupil registered at that school. In the event of a student being suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than six days, the principal of the school concerned is required to inform an educational welfare officer in writing. Boards of management of recognised schools are also required to submit a report on the levels of attendance at the school during the preceding school year to the relevant educational welfare officer, six weeks after the end of the school year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">The National Education Welfare Board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002, and is currently finalising its recruitment of head office staff. Some 36 former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford in accordance with guidance issued to them by the board. Proposals for the recruitment of an additional cohort of educational welfare officers have now been received from the board and are currently being examined by my Department. It is intended that the first of the new staff will be appointed later this year. I have allocated a budget of €5.2 million to the new service for the current year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1380">The 2003 schools building programme was published on 22 January 2003 and amounted to €342.9 million – four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver 146 large-scale projects at primary and postprimary level. In addition, approximately 433 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. Some 20 school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative.

          <p eId="para_1382">The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government. To meet our objectives, I will look closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">To ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system, GIS, database. My Department is at present undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey. The proposed standards will be largely based on the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools currently used by my Department.</p>

However, in view of the scale of the 2003 capital programme as now published, and available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position to authorise any additional projects to proceed in 2003. The timing of when this project can progress is dependent on the funding allocation in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1393">Under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2001, the regional fisheries boards are empowered to have a permit charge for angling on fisheries under their control and management. However, the application of such a permit charge is an operational matter solely for the relevant board to decide and is not something over which I, as Minister, have control. As I informed the House on 5 February 2003 and again on 25 and 26 February 2003, I am advised by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board that it has had a permit charge for trout angling for many years on the board controlled fisheries and that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day to day management of these fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">I understand the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board-controlled fisheries, on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species, on the same water, was not charged.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_1418">I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 175, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">St. Patrick's Day has traditionally signalled the start of the tourism season in Ireland. With the President, Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State visiting our key tourism markets – including Britain, North America, continental Europe, Canada and Australia – this year's programme of official overseas engagements for St. Patrick's Day presented a unique opportunity to ensure that Ireland was presented in a consistent manner as a top class tourist destination to a wide and receptive audience.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_149">To this end, my Department worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tourism Ireland Ltd. to maximise the tourism promotional potential of these visits by making available to all Ministers travelling abroad special tourism briefing and speaking points which were customised for individual major markets. In addition, direct dialogue between Tourism Ireland's market offices and the diplomatic missions at an early stage of the planning process ensured that tourism interests were accommodated in so far as possible within the official programmes being arranged by the missions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">The following examples illustrate how these visits were utilised for tourism promotion: in Australia, the President accompanied by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, participated at a highly successful lunch event in Sydney organised by Tourism Ireland for the tourism trade interests in that market. In Seoul, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Tom Parlon, launched Tourism Ireland's website, which is now available in Korean for the first time ever. In South Africa, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, spoke at a tourism breakfast organised by Tourism Ireland for the tourism trade in that market. In the US, I understand that Ministers travelling to this vital tourism market utilised the comprehensive briefing and speaking points provided by my Department at every available opportunity. In the current uncertainty in the international tourism market, particularly the US market, these visits were particularly useful in getting the message out that Ireland is open for tourism business and that the welcome is as warm as ever.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">I travelled to Britain, our largest tourism market, in the lead up to St. Patrick's Day to participate in a series of tourism promotions, including the official opening of the new Tourism Ireland offices in London, where I was joined by the Minister responsible for tourism in Northern Ireland, Mr. Ian Pearson, MP.

          <p eId="para_1421">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Under the programme, grants up to a maximum of €3.8 million are available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of a new pool subject, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. New Ross town council advised my Department in June, 2002 that it had appointed consultants to carry out a preliminary report in relation to its swimming pool facilities. It is a matter for New Ross town council to progress this matter and on receipt of the preliminary report, the proposal will be considered further by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1431">I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out-reach support to children of school-going age.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_154">Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision, including emergency admissions to residential care, this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1545">As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the operation of the special housing aid scheme for the elderly rests with the Western Health Board in the case of Mayo. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply direct to him, as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1547">Prior to 2000 my Department provided funding directly to health boards, public voluntary and joint board hospitals. This practice was largely overtaken by the arrangements put in place under the Health (Eastern Regional Health Authority) Act, 1999, whereby funding for all health agencies in the ERHA area is given to the authority and it is their responsibility to work with the three area health boards, the hospitals and other service providers in their region and to determine the level of funding for those agencies. St. John's Hospital, Limerick is the only voluntary hospital now receiving funding directly from my Department. The amounts allocated to health boards-authority for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 are set out in the following table.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1726">I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_177">In particular €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school-going age.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_179">I have no immediate plans to meet the National Parents and Siblings Alliance or the Irish Autism Alliance. I met the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland at the end of January and I will meet the Limerick Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped later this month.</summary>

      the reason, when a vehicle is out of use for a period of time with a certified NCT test, this certificate cannot be backdated for that period of time; if he intends to change this system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1730">In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The age of the vehicle and consequently the first test due date are determined by reference to the date of initial registration with subsequent test due dates falling every two years after the first test due date. Non-use of a vehicle is not a criterion in determining the NCT test due dates. The extension of the validity of a NCT certificate by any period a vehicle is not in use would be a departure from the test schedule laid down in the directive and, accordingly, I have no plans to change the existing arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1735">The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General made a number of recommendations relating to training for driver testers. Each of the recommendations is being implemented. All driver testers underwent a comprehensive two week refresher training programme in 2002 covering procedures to carry out the test, guidelines to assess faults, and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. An assessment of future training needs for driver testers is also being carried out. The work of driver testers is monitored on an ongoing basis by supervisory driver testers with a view to ensuring that a uniform standard of test is maintained.</p>

Postal voting was extended in 1997 to persons whose occupation, service or employment renders it likely that they would be unable to go in person to a polling station on polling day.

When all the votes are read into the count system and mixed prior to counting, the database containing the votes is secured. In the event of a systems failure at the count centre, the vote data in the modules can be read into the count system a second time so there is always a full copy available of the election database up to that point. The vote data is retained in the ballot modules for six months after the election, while the data in the back-up module is deleted after the count is completed.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1863">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_192">For the purpose of determining the amount of rent supplement payable, each health board has set maximum rent levels for different categories of households, for example, single people or families with children etc. The maximum levels were set by reference to the local property market and consequently they will differ from one board's functional area to another. In setting maximum rent levels, each board must be satisfied that accommodation is available at those levels. The levels in place in the North-Western Health Board region were set by the health board in October 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">Data provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that rent levels in the private sector have been stable for some time and have actually fallen in the period from April 2002. More recent data from the CSO confirms this trend. Accordingly, higher levels of maximum rents are not needed for the purpose of the SWA rent supplement scheme. In the circumstances, I decided to maintain the maximum rent levels, as set by the health boards, at their current levels until the end of December 2003. The North-Western Health Board advised my Department of its current maximum rent levels on 20 November 2002 and regulations giving effect to them were introduced shortly afterwards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_194">In general, a rent supplement is not payable where the amount of rent being sought exceeds the health board's appropriate level. However, the legislation governing the payment of rent supplement allows health boards to exceed their maximum levels in cases where, in the opinion of the board, exceptional circumstance exist. I am satisfied that the approach I am taking is correct. Setting higher maximum rent limits than are justified by the open market would distort the rental market, leading to a general rise in rent levels that would disadvantage people on low incomes.</summary>
