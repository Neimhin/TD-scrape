I welcome the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials to the meeting. He will brief the committee on the January ECOFIN meeting and the upcoming one on 16 February. It is timely to discuss developments in Europe such as the introduction of the proposed strategic investment fund, the annual growth survey and alert mechanism, and the move towards fiscal co-ordination under the European Stability and Growth Pact. I wish to advise witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the joint committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.

Although it is little under a week away from the meeting, and the final agenda may change, it is a useful opportunity to discuss the issues before finance Ministers at the Council. This will be the second ECOFIN meeting under the Latvian EU Presidency, Latvia having taken over the Presidency for the first time from 1 January 2015. I understand the Latvian ambassador to Ireland already briefed the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on 20 January on the Latvian priorities for its term. I will also provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the January ECOFIN meeting which took place in Brussels on 27 January and at which I represented Ireland. The agenda was dominated by two main areas, investment and governance. As part of the formal agenda, several items were approved under the A list procedure - that is, without debate - including the final compromise text of the anti-money laundering directive and regulation. On the taxation side, the anti-abuse clause to the parents-subsidiary directive was adopted, along with a recommendation for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 2532/98 concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions. Ministers discussed the European Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Fund for Strategic Investment and amending Regulations (EU) No. 1291/2013 and (EU) No. 1316/2013, as detailed in the communication An Investment Plan for Europe: European Fund for Strategic Investments, which was published on 26 November 2014. It is an initiative mobilising €315 billion of additional investment from public and private sources over the period 2015 to 2017. The Presidency updated the Council on the establishment of the ad hoc working party on the regulation, which involves the establishment of a European fund for strategic investments. Ministers had a preliminary exchange of views. This is a key priority for the Latvian Presidency, the European Commission and all member states in delivering jobs and growth for the people of Europe. ECOFIN noted a Presidency report, Current Legislative Proposals, on the state of play in negotiations on current financial services legislative proposals. This is a standard item at each Council and keeps Ministers appraised of the latest position on the individual financial services dossiers. Ministers were then given a presentation of the Latvian Presidency six-month work programme outlining priorities in the ECOFIN area. The European Commission also made a presentation on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Commission's 2015 work programme, entitled A New Start. Minsters discussed two items under the heading of economic governance and commission communications. The first one related to the communication from the Commission on the review of the six-pack and two-pack, entitled Economic Governance Review: Report on the Application of Regulations (EU) Nos. 1173/201, 1174/2011, 175/2011, 1176/2011, 1177/2011, 472/2013 and 473/2013. The review found that, overall, the reformed governance framework introduced by this legislation proved effective, although it acknowledged that the period of the review was limited. The second item is another communication from the Commission which clarifies the flexibility in the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, entitled Making the Best Use of the Flexibility Within the Existing Rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.The Commission presented both communications together. There was a broad-ranging discussion, and all parties agreed that progress had been made on these issues. The Council will come back to these in due course as the semester process unfolds. Finally, Ministers adopted the terms of reference under the agenda item Preparation of G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 9-10 February 2015 in Istanbul. That was a brief overview of last month's ECOFIN meeting. Now I will turn to the draft agenda for next week's ECOFIN meeting and provide an outline of the key issues that are likely to arise. Work is continuing at the level of officials, so there may still be changes between now and the meeting in terms of content and the order of the discussion. The draft agenda is divided into two parts. The first part of the agenda relates to legislative deliberations. These are items which are held in public. The A-list items are matters agreed without debate. At present there are no items under this heading. These will only become clear as the agenda is finalised. The next item is Investment Plan for Europe: European Fund for Strategic Investments (First Reading). Ministers are scheduled to have a state of play discussion on this issue as a follow-up to that at the January ECOFIN. The Presidency will update the Council on the progress of the ad hoc working party on the regulation. Discussions are ongoing. The Presidency is aiming to have an agreed Council position on the regulation to establish the fund by the March ECOFIN meeting in order to meet the deadline of agreement on the issue with the European Parliament by the end of June. The final item under this portion of the agenda is the item on current legislative proposals. This is the regular update from the Presidency on the financial services files. The second part of the agenda relates to the non-legislative activities. The first matter listed is the approval of the A-list items. This is without debate. We are not aware of any items under this heading at the moment. The next item listed is 2015 annual growth survey and the 2015 alert mechanism report. Ministers will have an exchange of views and adopt the draft Council conclusions on the 2015 annual growth survey and alert mechanism report. I understand that the chief economist of the Department briefed the committee on 21 January last on this matter. The publication of the annual growth survey kick-starts the annual cycle of the European semester. The annual growth survey identifies broad reform priorities for member states, to act as a foundation for the creation of growth and jobs. The 2015 survey has three pillars: a co-ordinated boost to investment, a renewed commitment to structural reforms, and fiscal responsibility. The reform priorities set out in the draft Council conclusions, once considered and agreed by ECOFIN, are expected to be endorsed by Heads of State and Government at the European Council in March. The alert mechanism report identifies the member states for which further analysis in the form of an in-depth review is necessary in order to decide whether an imbalance in need of policy action exists. The draft conclusions note the Commission's intention to publish analytical work for the 16 member states whose readings suggest they are in need of further analysis. These are expected to be published later this month. The next agenda item is a follow-up to the G20 meeting of finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 9-10 February 2015 in Istanbul. This is an information point. Terms of reference were adopted by the Council at the January ECOFIN and the item will provide an update on the discussion and outcome of the meeting. Next on the agenda is a Council recommendation on the discharge procedure in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2013. The discharge procedure is the annual process whereby the Council makes a recommendation to the European Parliament on whether to grant discharge to the European Commission for the manner in which the annual budget has been spent. At ECOFIN, the Council will be asked to consider and endorse the outcome of Council working group and COREPER deliberations on the Council's discharge recommendation to the European Parliament on budget 2013. This is an annual item and requires a qualified majority vote. Next up is the draft Council conclusions on the European budget guidelines for 2016. The budget guidelines are the Council's input to the Commission preparations for the 2016 budget proposal, reflecting the Council's priorities for the following year's budget. At ECOFIN, the Council is expected to endorse the draft guidelines.  Turning to the next item, first assessment report of the high level group on own resources, there will be a presentation by Mr. Mario Monti, chairman of the high level group on own resources, which was established with the aim of undertaking a general review of the EU own-resources system. That is the system by which the EU budget is financed. At ECOFIN, the group's chair will present the first assessment report, which was published last December. This initial assessment is a scene-setting document which, among other things, provides a background analysis of the current own-resources system, outlines the position of the various stakeholder institutions and highlights the issues to be considered in achieving reform in this area. It does not raise any issues of concern for Ireland.  The final item on the agenda is under the heading of any other business. No items are listed on the agenda under this heading at the moment. I trust the Chairman found the summary of last month's ECOFIN meeting and the outline of this month's ECOFIN agenda informative. I believe they give a good insight into the current issues before the Council. I thank the committee for its attention and, at this point, I am happy to respond to any questions or observations members may have.

Tomorrow's emergency Eurogroup meeting sounds much more exciting, but I guess we are not allowed to ask about that. We will start with ECOFIN, in any event. On the investment plan for Europe, which was dealt with in January and is on the agenda again for next week's meeting, in an Irish context, the overall figure of €315 billion sounds very impressive. Much of this will come from the private sector and will be leveraged over a period of time. We have submitted a list of possible projects. Will the Minister give the committee an indication of when he would expect this fund to be up and running and investments to start flowing to Ireland from it? 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	4	The authorities are anxious to proceed very quickly. It is known familiarly, as the Deputy knows, as the Juncker plan. Mr. Juncker, being the President, has a personal interest in advancing it quickly. The European Central Bank regards the investment programme as a very important parallel initiative to quantitative easing and believes that quantitative easing on its own would require an investment programme as well. I expect things to proceed very quickly after Tuesday's ECOFIN meeting. A national quota system is not applied to it. Initially, the timeframe was very short. We put in all the infrastructural projects which were available across different Departments and Government agencies. The next step for us is to prioritise and to select, from the very substantive list that was put in, the shovel-ready projects which would have most effect on growing our economy by providing essential infrastructure or by expanding on essential infrastructure. There is an indication that infrastructural projects with a trans-European relevance will be ones that continental Europe is interested in. However, it is possible to have analogous projects in a country such as Ireland which are compatible with the main thrust of the plan.For example, if they proceed with the trans-European energy delivery project - that is not its correct name, but the Deputy understands what I mean - we could invest here in an energy project that would not necessarily be connected but would be geared to achieve similar objectives.

Are they in the form of loans or equity? What form does the investment from this fund take?

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	10	I cannot say yet. There is a double tap on the leveraging. Approximately €21 billion is being put in, and that is leveraged three times in the first instance by the EIB, which brings the amount to approximately €63 billion. Then that is leveraged five times to reach the figure of €315 billion. It is at the second stage of leveraging that the matching private sector funds would be involved. As this is Europe-wide, we would not necessarily be confined to Irish companies. If the projects are big enough, the matching funds could come from anywhere, except that they are private sector.

The next step, activating it, is more a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and his Department, because it is something that would fit easily with an extension of a capital programme. Obviously, we will have an input. There will not be any secrets about it. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will share information with the committee.

It will review the 2014 budget. The way it normally works is that the creditor nations are critical and the expenditure nations are seeking expanded budgets. There is qualified majority voting; there will not be unanimity. Certain countries, which one can predict, will have a problem with overspending, while other countries, which one can predict as well, will have plans for additional expenditure.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	15	Are the draft guidelines for 2016 Europe-wide and not specific to individual countries at this stage?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	16	The Council recommendations for the 2016 budget guidelines are an important orientation of how member states would like to see next year's budget prepared. Ireland can support this Council recommendation, as it strikes the correct balance between investment in growth and job creation and recognising the requirement for fiscal prudence. This discussion takes place against the backdrop of severe economic challenges which still confront many member states. We welcome the fact that these guidelines, while acknowledging the current economic situation, also reflect the need to provide resources which would seek to boost growth, promote employment and enhance EU competitiveness. We concur with the view expressed by other member states that the provision of sufficient payment margin is prudent from a budgetary management perspective. Again, there are certain countries that wish to keep budgets very tight because they have the perspective of the people who pay for these things. Other countries want more expansion.

To what does that relate?

They report progress on the progress they are making through Council or the European Parliament. It is just for information. Nothing has been brought to my attention that I need to alert the committee to at this meeting.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	21	We are at the eve of a very important Eurogroup meeting and I wish to take this opportunity to ask the Minister about it. It is an emergency meeting, given the serious situation facing the Greeks and the implications it could have for the wider eurozone. What is the Irish Government's position going to that meeting tomorrow in terms of the possible options?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	22	The Deputy is familiar with the sequence of events. There was an election in Greece, which Syriza, the main opposition party, won. It quickly formed a government, and a cabinet was put in place. Then the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance embarked on a diplomatic initiative around Europe and visited the bigger countries, in particular, while representatives of the various European groups visited Athens. For example, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, went to Athens. The Deputy will have seen newspaper reports of the various bilateral meetings that took place. What is not clear at this stage is what the Greeks will ask. We know in general terms from the election campaign what they require, but they have not specifically put a request on the table. The Irish position is that we do not favour write-offs. Write-offs or write-downs will put a hole in the balance sheets of all 28 member states. There are other ways of meeting the objectives without writing off the capital amounts on the balance sheets. Beyond that, I will listen to the Greek proposals and treat them on their merits. The Irish Government has great sympathy for the Greek people and we hope that proposals will come forward that will help to bridge the gap that was clearly emerging between the larger European countries and the new Greek Government in the bilateral dialogues that took place last week, as reported in the business and political newspapers.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	23	There is a suggestion of a bridging agreement until June, extending the agreement which is due to end at the end of February by a number of months, to allow some time and breathing space for fuller negotiation of the Greek position. Would the Irish Government be open to that?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	24	I must wait to hear the proposal. One suggestion for a bridge is that the Greek authorities would be allowed to sell treasury bills up to the level of the bridge required. Originally they were talking about €15 billion, but it now appears the bridge would be more than that, because there has been fall-off in the collection of taxes. The European Central Bank has set a limit on the amount that can be raised on treasury bills. If that request is made, the first intervention in reply will be by the European Central Bank. It is a technical issue, so I am not quite sure. There are media reports that there will be a four-pillar approach, but I do not know whether that is correct. I do not wish to speculate on it. The Deputy is familiar with the suggestions that have been made in the newspapers, and that is one of them. The German reports were that a programme is finishing in February, that the conditions of the programme have not been fulfilled by Greece and that Greece should fulfil those conditions. The negotiating space is to negotiate a new programme. That appears to be a rejection of the bridging proposal by one of the lead participants, but we must wait and see. There are various other suggestions around, but I do not know what weight the Greek Government would attach to them. However, they are attributed to the Greek Government. One of them is that it would be willing to comply with 70% of the reforms and it would like to replace the other 30% with structural reforms as designed by the OECD. The OECD would be generally recognised as the international authority that is best fitted to restructure economies and certain aspects of countries' economic approach. That is one of the pillars. There is also a suggestion that instead of having a primary surplus of 3%, as required at present, the Greeks will seek to have that reduced to 1.5%. Then there are proposals on debt reliefs and debt swaps of various types, including growth-linked bonds.The European Central Bank is the first responder, but it seems there are technical difficulties immediately once one goes down that route. I do not know whether the newspaper and media reports are correct, but there is an indication that it is somewhere in that space. That might be for discussion tomorrow, but I have had no communication from the Greek authorities or any other group in Brussels that this is actually the space. There is one shot at it by what are usually informed people in the media.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	25	Before I refer to the ECOFIN meeting, I would like to pick up on the last comment on the emergency Eurogroup meeting tomorrow. While none of us is aware of the Greeks' proposals, we are aware from what was said by the Greek Finance Minister that there will be firm proposals at the Eurogroup meeting tomorrow. We are also aware that the central demand is for a bridging programme and space to allow the new Greek Government to negotiate with its creditors. In regard to the principle that a newly elected government be given space to negotiate and come up with proposals, is this something the Irish Government will support at the Eurogroup? I refer to the principle, not the specific recommendation because obviously its detail will inform the Minister. Does he support the concept and principle that space be given to the newly elected government to negotiate with its creditors?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	26	As I said, I have great sympathy for the Greek people and absolutely recognise, as anyone would, the mandate given to the new Greek Government by Greek voters and the Greek population, but I am holding my position until I hear the proposals because to speculate now might give absolutely the wrong steer, as the situation is very sensitive. I thought there would be more time, but things have moved very rapidly in a very short space of time. However, I do not think the discussions will conclude tomorrow. We will have the Eurogroup meeting, to be followed by the ECOFIN meeting on Monday and Tuesday next. It is more likely to come to a head at that stage, if it is to come to a head in the medium term. As regards the Irish position on what space will be allowed to the Greek Government, it will depend on the nature of the mechanism to provide that space. If the position of many European colleagues is accepted that they will accept the conditionality of the existing programme and commit to complying with it, I am not too sure. In terms of bridging finance through Treasury bills, I can foresee getting into difficulty with the ECB, although I do not want to be categoric. The issue is sensitive and I do not want to reject any proposal before I see the detail, but, generally, as I said, I will have a sympathetic approach.

On positions he has articulated which possibly come from others on fulfilling the outstanding conditions under the programme, is it the Government's position that the programme, as constructed, is not capable of working? We are talking about a programme that has added €240 billion of debt to the Greek economy. Approximately 10% of this figure has found its way into Greek public services and so on, while the other 90% has gone towards servicing debt. Is it the Government's position that there needs to be change, but let us negotiate what that change should look like?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	28	A new government has been elected in Greece on a platform of change. As I said, I respect the mandate it has received. Obviously, what is at issue is the nature of that change. When we were elected in 2011, we were committed to making changes and we did so. We negotiated the changes and I put forward the proposition in Europe that, as far as I was concerned, it was one piece of the negotiations, that there would be rolling negotiations over the lifetime of the Government. As late as last September, we were still negotiating changes and got our colleagues to agree to refinancing the IMF loans, for example. The Deputy should see it, therefore, as one piece of the negotiations and as part of a process over a period of time. That is the space I think the Greek authorities should move into, but I do not know what is in their minds. They have said contradictory things and as such, I am not quite sure where they stand. There is a major humanitarian crisis emerging in Greece as it runs out of money, as poor people get poorer and revenue falls off. In talking about four pillars of negotiation there is a humanitarian crisis issue for Greece which I would like to see addressed.

First, we will not favour any write-off of debt for the reasons I have given because if we write off debt, it will make a hole in everyone else's balance sheet. If we park debt - even if no interest is being paid on it - the debt is still owed on the balance sheet. Second, I want Greece to stay in the eurozone. I would not favour any strategy that would encourage, induce or drive Greece out of it.

Without second-guessing the views of citizens across the State, I genuinely believe the vast majority of them would support allowing the Greek people time. The Minister is right to point out that there is a humanitarian crisis, but it did not emerge yesterday or after the election; it has been ongoing for quite a while. It is the result, although not primarily, of the extend and pretend nature of dealing with the crisis in Greece of loading more debt on debt. That is part of the problem and I hope a conclusion is reached at the Eurogroup, although I do not expect a final conclusion to be reached. I hope, however, that it will be the start of reaching a conclusion. The Irish Government should not be a bystander but a willing participant in trying to ensure Greek and Irish debts are brought to a sustainable level, or a more sustainable level in our case.

It was about loading €240 billion of debt onto the economy. I do not think any economist believes - the Minister can ask the economist sitting beside him - Greece can pay back that debt. I have not heard one economist argue that point. I would like to move on to discuss the ECOFIN meeting and the investment plan which will be co-funded from our own resources. Is that correct?

He will be welcomed to the meeting and, early in its course, asked to state his case. It will be up to him to make a proposal. There will be a Heads of State and Government meeting on Thursday at which the Taoiseach will represent us. On the following Monday there will be the normal monthly Eurogroup meeting. On Tuesday there will be an ECOFIN meeting. It seems that tomorrow's discussions will scope the problem, with a view to scoping possible solutions.

People are waiting on Greece to make a proposal to determine whether there can be a development of consensus for negotiating purposes. Different statements have been made in different capitals by the Greek Prime Minister and Finance Minister. The Prime Minister returned home and addressed Parliament on Sunday in a full speech, but everything that was stated on Sunday did not match the detail of the dialogue in European capitals. I do not want to be definitive about anything because I am not sure what the Greek position is, but I hope it will be clarified tomorrow.

I do not want to overdramatise it, but I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government are stabbing the Greek people in the back. In the process we are stabbing in the back all of the victims of failed austerity policies, including in this country, by refusing their initial proposal, which is very clear, that there be a debt conference along the lines of the post-war debt conference, from which Germany benefited, with a 50% write-down of debt and an extension of the rest of the debt for such a period that it effectively wrote it off. This allowed for the reconstruction of Germany and, essentially, the rebuilding of Europe. It was a very good proposal and I do not understand why the Minister did not support it. Does the Minister accept that the election result in Greece stems from the fact that the policies pursued by the troika have been a disastrous failure in Greece? Is it not absolutely obvious that the policies have been a disastrous failure? We have seen the verdict of the Greek people against the background of a humanitarian crisis caused directly by austerity. It did not produce the growth the troika stated it would, led to a collapse of the economy and produced a humanitarian crisis, which is appalling. It turfed thousands of workers out of their jobs and slashed incomes, leaving 40% of young people in poverty and 26% unemployed. The Greek people have rightly said this policy is not working and that we need a radically different approach, saying the debt is unsustainable and needs to be written down and that we need an end to austerity policies. Does the Minister agree that they are right to say austerity has not worked? We should support them in saying, after six years, that it is clear it has not worked, that we need a different approach and that the proposal was a fair and reasonable one in order to start looking in different directions?

The programme was designed for Ireland and Ireland implemented it, including the vast bulk of the structural reforms in it. Portugal implemented the structural reforms in its programme; Spain implemented the structural reforms in its programme and Cyprus is implementing the structural reforms in its programme. Greece, however, did not implement the structural reforms in its programme and, as a result, its economy is not growing fast enough to get out of difficulty. It is fashionable to load all of the blame on the countries that were supplying money and credit to Greece, but there is a problem with the way the programme was implemented in Greece.

The Greek authorities, for a number of years, did not take the same actions as the Irish, Portuguese and Spanish authorities. Structural reform was necessary. Greece implemented quite a number of measures and the economy began to grow, but it is faltering. This is the fourth programme for it. Various adjustments were made to the previous three programmes. We are not starting at the beginning.

They had a devastating effect. The initial prediction was that imposing this level of austerity on Greece would lead to a return to growth much quicker and that the adverse effects would not be as severe as they turned out to be. The troika was wrong - it has had a devastating effect in Greece.

The IMF programme in Greece runs until May 2016 and, if it wants to help Greece, it can reconstruct its programme for it. Let us talk straight. European countries have supported Greece. Ireland has supported it in a small way because this is also a programme country. There were faults in the programme which were identified. Over three programmes, attempts were made to correct them. However, it is a fallacy to say all the of fault lies with the creditor nations and that no fault lies with Greece. The Deputy probably knows what the situation is in Greece. If the Greek people had paid their taxes, they would not be faced with the same humanitarian crisis.

We are at a very serious point. The Greek Finance Minister rightly stated that we could be facing a house of cards if Greece is forced out because the ECB, Angela Merkel and other Governments are insisting on this hard-line refusal of a write down and making any deal conditional on keeping with a programme that the Greek people simply can no longer take. I ask the Minister why we appear to be siding with Angela Merkel and the ECB rather than acknowledging that the Greeks have a point.

I said that we are pursuing our own interests and that our two red lines are no write-downs and that we want to keep Greece in the eurozone.

We are not going to help them to get a write-down but we want to benefit from any write-down they achieve. Is that not a shameful position to take?

I am going to a meeting tomorrow. I outlined to him our red lines, which are very limited, but I want to hear the Greek proposal. Since I read the election manifesto of the party that is now in power in Greece, there has been no mention by the Greek Prime Minister or Finance Minister, or anybody else in the Administration, of a debt conference. The only place I saw it mentioned was in the party's election manifesto. They have not mentioned a debt conference in any of their bilaterals as reported in the international press or in my briefing notes. Like other programme countries, they are quite prepared to use the Eurogroup and ECOFIN as the forum for their negotiations. I am not going to put a debt conference on the table when the Greeks have not done so.

I wonder whether the fault is the lack of an exit mechanism in the euro. He made a comment several years ago about feta cheese which was taken as humour, whereas I think his point was that Greece needs to export more. It is stuck at a fixed exchange rate compared to the drachma. I predict that this problem will recur despite efforts to make up for it via massive transfers. The lack of an exit mechanism may be a design fault in the euro. Apparently a state can leave the EU but it cannot leave the currency. Greece's problem is that it is locked into a relationship in which it cannot survive. Last Friday I attended a meeting in TCD which Deputy Boyd Barrett addressed. I was only in the congregation, but it was interesting. One of the speakers was from Syriza and some of her comments were relevant to the Irish case. Syriza recognises that the Greek State has also failed and the speaker contended that the left has to confront the State when it fails. The Minister may hear some interesting insights at tomorrow's meeting in regard to how this issue is viewed. This is related to some of his comments about tax collection and the volume of directives with regard to enterprise. The speaker hinted that Greece is a bad country in which to do business. The Minister referred to 16 member states which may be in need of further analysis. Was he referring to difficulties in economic policies for those states?

We had six last year and four this year. They are quite predictable. The indicators are the size of the national debt, the amount of personal debt, the level of unemployment and the net balance of payments or international investment position.

In many of the Mediterranean countries the problem is high levels of unemployment, including in particular youth unemployment. There is no doubt they are real problems.

When they do not work they leave the debt mountain in place and we do not get the increase in GDP. There is a "free money from Brussels" syndrome in spending that money. I hope there is a high standard of project appraisal to prevent a recurrence. The anti-money-laundering directive and the anti-abuse clauses for parent and subsidiary companies are pertinent in light of the reports on HSBC's involvement in tax avoidance and evasion. It is important that, at a time when public morale is low in regard to taxation, banks and accountancy firms are not allowed to shunt the burden onto average people. Margaret Hodge, MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee in the UK, pointed out that some of the financial institutions which not long ago were knocking on the UK Treasury's door to ask for a bailout are now facilitating tax avoidance in a number of countries, at great cost to the rest of society but substantial profits for the banks.

We are doing a fairly good job in Ireland on eliminating tax evasion. Whenever I get a request from the Revenue Commissioners to plug holes that are being exploited by tax advisers, I legislate to plug those holes. Europe is also making progress on the issue, with automatic exchange of information on deposits in banks. Countries such as Switzerland are also being drawn in. A range of initiatives is being taken, but tax avoidance is a big industry, whether for corporate tax or other forms of taxation. We will be carrying out a cost benefit analysis on the projects we submit for funding, but the European Investment Bank will also be assessing projects from a risk point of view and their capacity to pay a commercial return. It will be the organiser and deliverer of the investment fund. The fund is envisaged as a companion initiative to quantitative easing. Europe needs investment if it is to create jobs and cut into high unemployment levels, particularly youth unemployment, and to build the modern infrastructure required for a continent that is competing with the United States, China and many of the emerging nations. While €350 billion seems a massive sum, it is small by global comparisons. I hope the various initiatives will work together because we have gone through a very fallow period in Europe and we need things to start working. Almost everything has been tried at this stage.

Many people from all countries - not just Germany - feel that Greece was let down by its elected representatives, including the present government, in the promises made to the Greek people. We could have a more open debate about what happened there rather than just scoring political points.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Scrutiny of EU Legislative Proposals	119	One does not wish to typecast an entire population. There are many people trying extraordinarily hard to sort things out. It is a very difficult model. We must remember there was civil war in Greece until 1949. When our Civil War was over there was conflict between the combatants, but in Greece there were a lot of consequences for the losing side. People in the public service were forced out, and a lot of people emigrated. Nearly half a million Greek communists settled in Bulgaria. There was huge emigration to the United States, Canada and Australia. As a result of what happened in the 1950s, Melbourne is the second biggest Greek city in the world after Athens. When the first left-wing government formed in 1980 under Mr. Papandreou senior, its policies also had consequences because he attempted to right the wrongs of what had happened after the civil war. The civil service and the public sector were increased dramatically so he could have his own supporters in there. Our Civil War was not as extensive, but by 1924 the sons of opposing combatants were playing on the same Gaelic football teams, and people were doing business together and were intermarrying. That is not the way it happened in Greece. The Greeks had a difficult past, interrupted by the colonels taking over. There is a long tradition and we should not be judgmental. We should do our best to be of assistance, but we have our own priorities also. That is the point I am making. It is not lack of sympathy for Greece, but we are only barely out of the woods.

When you have an issue of insolvency, what must be done is to restructure or write down the debt. The Minister has just taken one of the solutions off the table. I think the Minister should go into the meeting tomorrow with an open mind.

I think that is a mistake in an insolvency situation, because the second red-line issue is whether Greece stays in the eurozone. There is a real danger that other partners in Europe could force a situation in which it is impossible for Greece to stay in the eurozone despite the commitment of its Government to stay. If the Minister is going in with an open mind, he should not have a red-line issue. The projects submitted for the investment programme, which will be leveraged about 15 times to come to that level, were done haphazardly.

There are circumstances in which measures may be conceded to Greece or designed for Greece which would run to our disadvantage. For example, any indication that our debt is not sustainable could run against our best interests. This morning we were getting ten-year money on the secondary market at 1.20%, while the rate on Greek ten-year debt was 10.67%. We are not in the same space.
