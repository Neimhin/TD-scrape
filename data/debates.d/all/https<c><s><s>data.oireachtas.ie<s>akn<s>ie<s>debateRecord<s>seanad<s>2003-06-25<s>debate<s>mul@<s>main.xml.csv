#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to institute an immediate inquiry into allegations contained in a newspaper (details supplied) on 22 June 2003 that RUC officers may have colluded in the murder of the late councillor, Eddie Fullerton, at his home in Buncrana, County Donegal.I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on progress in the rebuilding of the Glanbia meat plant at Rooskey.I regard the matter raised by Senator Higgins as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Bannon as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 14 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the report of the audit of health structures and the commission into health funding report, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of statements at approximately 1.50 p.m.; No. 3, Arts Bill 2002 – Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m. – there is one Goverment amendment; and No. 15, motion No. 32, to be taken from 6 p.m to 8 p.m. In a change to the Order of Business, there will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Let me explain the change to the House. When a Bill is not initiated in the House, we often take the example of how it proceeded through the other House. During its passage through the other House the Arts Bill evoked much lively comment and many amendments which were very lengthy. That does not appear to be the case in this House where clearly we appear to be more culturally minded. We have been able to deal with the Bill very quickly with the result it does not need the time allocated.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I will enter into direct negotiations now with the Leader of the House across the floor of the House. It is not acceptable that the House should not sit between 2. p.m. and 5.30 p.m. This is a full working day. While I understand the Leader's remarks regarding the Arts Bill, we could fill the gap. There are two possible solutions. First, we could bring forward our Private Members' motion to 2 p.m. or 2.30 p.m., subject to the availability of the Minister, and debate the issue of neutrality, on which more Members would be able to speak during the afternoon. Second, as the Leader is aware, the International Court of Arbitration yesterday made a very positive ruling in respect of the Government's rights regarding consultation on Sellafield. I suggest the House debate that issue today, particularly as there is now a three hour gap.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	3	There will have to be a natural sos, perhaps between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I agree.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am proposing two options, the first of which is to bring Private Members' Business forward. The second option is to debate, without a Minister in the House, the opinion released by the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration yesterday. There is all-party support for the Government's role in demanding better consultation with the UK Government in relation to Sellafield. I would like to make a direct proposal to the Leader. She knows from her work with the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the statutory agency which deals with nuclear safety, has an immediate right to act as an observer at Sellafield and give impartial and independent evidence to the Irish people on a daily or weekly basis, as it sees fit. The Leader knows that the International Atomic Energy Agency is already present at Sellafield. I ask the Government to demand that the UK Government grant observer status at Sellafield to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland immediately in order that it can issue its report to the Government and the people, as it sees fit.I ask for the Leader's support for either of my proposals relating to two issues that can be debated earlier in the day.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I would support either of the two suggestions made by Senator Brian Hayes and be amenable to a proposal of a similar nature. It would not look good if the House did not sit for that time.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I agree.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	9	We should put our heads together to deal with this problem.I would like to mention some issues that have been raised. Senator MacSharry spoke yesterday about the various groups which have blocked positive development. There is a case for dealing with such issues. Senators on the Government side raised the possibility of a deeper debate on transport. We should look at the position in Irish life of organisations such as those mentioned by Senator MacSharry which are supported by State funds and often stand in the way of important development.Senator Kenneally raised the issue of fisheries yesterday. I ask for the Leader's support on this matter. The Deputy Leader is interested in fishing of a different type. When fishing rights were granted to landowners in the last century, an unscrupulous and greedy landowner in the Kenmare area managed, through a process of mealladh, bradadh agus bagairt, to get the Parliament in Westminster to pass an Act which changed the name of the Kenmare estuary to the Kenmare river. This meant that fishing rights from the town of Kenmare to south of the Sceilig were given to an unscrupulous landowner. The legislation is still in place and continues to prevent those involved in the fishing industry from fishing in the area which is not included in the Irish Box or the Shannon rights.I would like the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the process that needs to be pursued to bring about change, for example, by means of reforming or amending legislation, and to ensure fishing rights in the Kenmare area are restored to the fishing industry. This issue does not involve the European Union as it is something we can address in this House. It is absolutely disgraceful that this has been a problem for many generations. There were many discussions on the issue about ten years ago and I do not know the reason action was not taken at that point. I would like the Minister to indicate how this matter can be addressed in a proper, fair and equitable manner.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I accept that the Leader of the House could not have been aware of the level of amendment of the Arts Bill. The fact that it was amended to such a great extent in the Dáil meant that it came to this House in a form satisfactory to us. The level of debate in the Dáil meant that we were quite happy with the Bill. The Leader of the House wanted to provide sufficient time for discussion of it and could not have anticipated what was to happen.The additional time available to the House provides a good opportunity to debate a number of issues raised by Senators such as planning. I ask the Leader to consider allocating time for a discussion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's proposals for changing the way in which tribunals are run, although I do not think it will be possible to do so today. The Minister has suggested that there could be private hearings, following which an eminent judge would deliver a conclusion. The proposals have been made in the light of the fact that certain tribunals, particularly the Flood tribunal, have been in progress for so long. It would be useful for the House to have a general discussion on the principle of how we examine issues of major public concern. It is clear that the tribunals as currently constituted are causing problems in certain respects. This House has always been afforded the opportunity to discuss the reports of various tribunals and it is important that we discuss the principles of any new legal framework before it is brought before us. The Minister should come to the House to set out his thoughts on the matter beforehand.The rights of persons with disabilities is another issue that could be discussed this afternoon, particularly in the light of the proposal in recent days for the appointment of an ombudsman for people with disabilities. We should consider whether such an appointment would represent the proper framework for progress. This is another area that could be discussed this afternoon or at another time.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I wonder if the Minister for Transport can come to the House before the recess to discuss the financing of the national roads programme, including the charging of tolls. If possible, the Minister might outline the cost benefit analysis and details of the letters he has received from the Irish Road Haulage Association about how congestion is costing millions, if not billions, of euro. Perhaps we are all wrong and it is not worth €4.90 to avoid waiting in a queue in Drogheda for 30 minutes. One will pay four times that amount, as a private motorist, to pass through a toll bridge on a French autoroute. I have seen few more ridiculous protests, to be frank. I presume that the new toll-free stretch of road which will open tomorrow will not be boycotted. The benefits of new roads outweigh the small sums involved. I am sorry that Senator Bannon is not here to debate the matter.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I support the argument made by Senator O'Toole. I hope the problems in Kenmare will be examined.It is timely, given the imminent retirement of Mr. Justice Flood, chairman of the Flood tribunal, that we invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss the issue of tribunals which has been brought into sharp focus once more. Eight tribunals are meeting and it seems that some people are experiencing tribunal fatigue. I do not think that people, including Members, are following closely the progress of the tribunals. A massive amount in costs is involved and many lawyers have become millionaires as a result. Funds in many other areas such as disability, which has been highlighted in this House, could be more meaningfully spent elsewhere.There has to be a better way of conducting the tribunal process. I remind Senators of the achievements of the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by the late Jim Mitchell, in the space of one month – some £185 million was retrieved from the banking institutions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come to the House in order that we can debate whether there is a better way of expediting this process. It is farcical in the extreme that it is projected that the Flood tribunal will sit for another 15 years. I ask Senators to try to quantify the costs of the tribunal if it lasts for another 15 years and compare it to what is likely to be highlighted. If the Minister was here, we could constructively discuss whether there was a better way of trying to expedite this process, which is somewhat ridiculous at this stage.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I thank Senator O'Toole for his support of the comments I made yesterday on planning, specifically in respect of the organisations which are State-funded and which persist in blocking planning. I reiterate what I said yesterday. This is a vitally important issue. If time is available this afternoon, we should use it to discuss the matter. No real preparation is required, as everyone is aware of the difficulties that exist throughout the country. These minority groups, with questionable motives, are blocking progress for the greater good in rural and urban areas.As a result of what Senators said in regard to tribunals, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on tribunals in general and the direction of same. The costs involved have spiralled out of control. There have been suggestions that tribunals will continue for a further 15 or 20 years, which is ridiculous in the extreme, particularly when one considers that €60 million has been spent to date. Where will it all end? That money is needed by Government Departments. There may be other structures within the courts system to adequately deal with the matters under investigation. If people are suspected of wrongdoing, let the law deal with them through the courts.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Would it be possible to have a debate on the drugs problem, particularly as it affects our cities? I have recently become aware of the development of a potential epidemic of crack cocaine in the city of Dublin, which underlies some of the poor behaviour on our streets. A special task force should be established to combat this problem before it gets completely out of hand.Dublin has been transformed since I was young. Gangland warfare is apparently openly tolerated. I do not consider such behaviour tolerable. If possible, the organs of the State should be put into action to defeat this problem. The potential of a crack cocaine epidemic is apparent in the inner city, particularly in Parnell Street. The Garda is aware that the drug is being dealt on that street, on which there are several "crack" houses. This type of thing is just not tolerable.The second matter I wish to raise also arose yesterday. I refer to the question of a future debate on domestic partnerships in the light of the report which was due from the National Economic and Social Forum. I said that I might refer to it again today because it was under an embargo.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I did not realise that.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	20	However, Maureen Gaffney was interviewed on the radio this morning by Marian Finucane and she discussed it in some detail. The principal issue is that this independent body will make strong recommendations to Government that there should be legislation along the lines of domestic partnerships. As I said previously, the House could play a role in that regard. I have convened a small committee which is trying to prepare legislation.Would it be possible to make some level of assistance available from the parliamentary counsel's office so that, at the very least, we could put our amateur effort to the test by requesting that it be scrutinised? This is quite important if we want the House to be energetic, particularly in terms of legislative proposals coming from different sections of it. If that is the case, then we should have some technical assistance because, while I am certainly not overburdened by modesty, I do not regard myself as competent in the area of parliamentary drafting.I agree with what has been said about the tribunals. It seems absolutely insane. The Flood tribunal has been going on for six or seven years and it is contemplating another 15.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	21	There is another 15 years to go.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	22	That is incredible. I cannot believe that we are going to put up with this kind of nonsense. There is no doubt that it is a gravy train for lawyers, which is particularly unfortunate in circumstances where, as colleagues have pointed out, there are serious shortages and where ordinary people are feeling the pinch, yet we see lawyers – on whom I wish no ill – smiling all the way to the bank.

#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Will the Leader invite the Tánaiste to come before the House – hopefully before the recess – to discuss the issue of our competitiveness and the difficulties that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized firms, are facing? From next February the minimum wage will be raised to €7 per hour. This will have an impact on businesses at a time when we have failed to deal with the issue of increasing insurance costs – public liability and employers' liability – and when the cost of rent and rates has continued to rise.While we never outstripped the basic unit cost of manufacturing in Asia or the Philippines, we were at least beating that of the United States. Organisations based in the west have indicated to me that we are no longer beating the US dollar price for the unit cost of manufacturing. The implication of this is that manufacturing will be moved out of Ireland. We have not moved high enough up the value chain to be able to sustain that loss.The Tánaiste should come before the House as a matter of urgency so that, when we return after the summer recess, we will have some idea about how it is proposed to halt the drain of jobs which, in my opinion, will happen later this year and early next year.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I agree with Senator Finucane's comments on tribunals. What is happening at the tribunals borders on the absurd. A former politician was recently cross-examined about allegedly receiving a sum of money and the senior counsel who cross-examined him was earning twice that amount per day at the tribunal. One would question the logic behind the tribunal process. It is time we had a debate on this issue.Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, signed an order increasing the minimum wage to €7. Will the Leader endeavour to ascertain if the minimum wage is being implemented across Europe? I am aware of many third level students who will be working in other EU countries during the summer and who will not earn the minimum wage. I would appreciate if the Leader could procure the information to which I refer because serious questions have been raised. Perhaps we could have a debate on the matter.On "Morning Ireland" this morning, there was an interesting discussion on illegal Irish immigrants in America. It focused on the difficulties they experience in returning home and, more particularly, when they try to go back to America. Will the Leader investigate the issue of how many Irish people are living illegally in America and what difficulties they are encountering in their daily lives, such as those in regard to obtaining driving licences? Will she communicate my concerns on the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Perhaps he could come before the House to explain what steps he intends to take in terms of communicating with the relevant American authorities in respect of this matter. Ireland is supposed to be friendly with America, but I do not believe that the latter is treating the Irish very well in this instance.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I am sure that a statute drafted by Senator Norris would be infinitely more entertaining and probably a good deal more intelligible than most of the material that comes before us from the parliamentary counsel's office. We should encourage some improvement in the language used in drafting legislation, which has become enormously technical.I am aware that we are making suggestions for debates. I am not sure if, at this stage, we are bidding for the Leader's attention for the time that might become available this afternoon. That might depend on which Minister is available. I do not have any difficulty with the suggestions that have been made, but it would be particularly appropriate to take up Senator O'Meara's suggestion that we have a debate on disability. The Special Olympics, particularly the opening ceremony, has captured the imagination of the country and it is important that we should build on this.The profile of disability needs to be raised and the potential and the real contribution that disabled people can, and do, make to life and the economy can be recognised. As Senator Norris said yesterday, it need not be a question of bashing the Government in regard to cuts, etc. We could have a civilised debate about the role of people with disabilities and the support that can be given to them by society.I also wish to raise the issue of the toll bridge. I cannot believe that people do not save money by using a toll bridge. A toll is €5 and for that one saves 30 minutes driving time and one also makes savings in terms of petrol costs and on wear and tear to one's vehicle. People should actually be paying more for it. If it is not used, I would encourage the Minister to use by-law powers to ensure that the citizens of Slane and Drogheda are saved from the passage of heavy vehicles.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I ask the Leader, once more, to request the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House. This morning, many Members have outlined their dissatisfaction with the cost of tribunals. It is difficult to understand the persistence of the Minister for Education and Science in engaging in constant litigation, costing over €4.5 million, seeking to justify the Department's position in denying parents and children their entitlements and rights to a reasonable standard of education, particularly in the case of those with a disability. What a difference a small portion of that funding would mean to the family in County Donegal where, as reported this morning, the parents have to go to the school regularly during the day to bring their child home to provide toilet facilities. If a Minister persists in spending scarce resources on an ongoing basis, without having learned that he is achieving nothing other than pursuing his own ego, it is important that he should come to this House and give his reasons for allowing such hardship cases to go without while he provides legal teams seeking to deny people with disabilities their rights. I urge the Leader to request the Minister to explain his position in this House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I support the call by Senators MacSharry and O'Toole for a debate on planning issues, for which I have called on a number of occasions. There is great concern in this regard, particularly in my home county, Clare. Until recently, there were two agencies which had an unnecessary role in the whole planning process, one of which was Dúchas. I am delighted the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently made some very necessary changes. However, one group still remains in place – I refer to An Taisce, which is causing untold problems throughout the country. There is a nightmare situation in County Clare, with planning objections being made by people from outside the county.I am not sure we should deal with this today. The Minister should be present for such a debate because legislation will be required. We must review the whole area as to who has the right to object and their reasons for objecting. The idea of somebody who lives in County Donegal objecting to a house being built in County Clare is quite outrageous. This is happening.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It should be debated on the ground.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	33	There is a hidden agenda in this regard and it is about time we took it on. I would certainly welcome a debate. However, it is not a matter we should rush today. I would like to have the Minister present as legislation is required. I look forward to that debate.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	35	As the issue I wish to raise is not as urgent as some of the others mentioned, I am not calling for a debate today. I refer to the looming trade war which is likely to affect the Irish and European economies in the coming year, during the Irish Presidency of the European Union. At a food conference which I attended last week, the main topic was a clash between the United States and Europe and the implications with regard to food which will clearly endanger the Irish economy. The main topic in that regard related to genetically modified foods, in respect of which there are totally different attitudes on the part of the Americans and the Europeans. If this is liable to come to a head during the Irish Presidency, we should be prepared for it.My concern is that the Ministers concerned, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, should be ready with a success story when that situation arises. Mr. Peter Sutherland managed to achieve success some years ago when he was involved in the World Trade Organisation negotiations at the time. I raise the matter because of its potentially serious consequences, the fact that it will occur within the next few months and will be an issue during the Irish Presidency.The conference I attended last week was also attended by Bob Geldof. Senators would have been proud to hear an Irishman's attitude to the criticism of Europe and the way we treat food imports, in terms of our treatment of those who rely on exports from Africa to Europe, debarring them from entry to European markets because of our selfish attitude with regard to our economy and agriculture. While it is not a debate for today, it is an issue we should grasp during the coming months to ensure we are prepared for next year.

#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on a number of issues. I refer, first, to competitiveness, which is the interests of all of us, having regard to the change in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar, high insurance costs and changing events within Europe. A delegation from the Hungarian Parliament visited the Houses of the Oireachtas last week. They are now achieving what we achieved some years ago – I see certain similarities in that regard. We must watch our position within Europe. I ask that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House to outline her assessment of the future competitiveness of this country.I also join in the calls for a debate on disability issues. I share with my colleagues in the great feeling of pride at Ireland's management of the Special Olympics. The opening ceremony and ongoing events are a source of considerable pride.I agree we will need to have a debate on the issue of genetically modified foods. We should view it in a very sane and balanced manner and avoid frightening people with the idea of "frankenfood". The approach should be to ensure there will be benefits all round, rather than a Luddite opposition to all progress. We should take our time while also ensuring that necessary progress actually takes place.

If we fail to tackle it, we will be open to the situation which developed in New York some years ago when it reached epidemic proportions. It was only when the users moved to a softer drug that the level of violent crime was reduced.My main reason for speaking relates to the Special Olympics. I join other Senators in paying tribute to the volunteers and all those who joined in creating a great sense of belief and well-being. I compliment the Croke Park authorities, especially Mr. Seán Kelly, the new president of the GAA, who has shown a very progressive and open approach. I call on the Minister concerned, or perhaps even the Taoiseach, to come to this House and, on the back of this very successful campaign, outline plans for a bid for the Olympic Games in 2016. I believe this city and country are capable of this. With a confident approach, we can make a very successful bid.

It has come to my notice that there is a very definite possibility of local authorities being faced with multi-million euro law suits. Consultants brought into various counties to help designate certain areas where constraints would apply are now stating in their preambles that the designations they have proposed would not stand up to legal scrutiny. County Clare is one of the counties in which there is such a preamble to the consultants' report. If consultants are saying this and a person has been refused planning permission on the grounds put forward in the relevant designation, that person can now go into court, not only to seek a reversal of the decision but also to seek compensation. I regard that as a very serious matter.

An Taisce has been mentioned. There are opposing views on the issue. However, while I do not agree with its views, the fault does not lie with An Taisce but in how our development plans are framed, which prohibits rural housing.

However, the answer is not on the opposite side but somewhere in the middle. We need a formula which allows for rural housing, while protecting the environment and ensuring sustainability. The way to achieve this is through the inclusion of a formula in our development plans. An Taisce wins its cases because of the way they are currently framed.

These are emotive issues. The issue of disability is always a sensitive one. There are balance of rights issues involved here which have legal and constitutional implications. We all acknowledge, and the Minister is acknowledging with the forthcoming disabilities Bills, that these issues must be fully and comprehensively addressed. These are also issues for the taxpayers.We welcome the Government's decision to bring forward the disabilities Bills sooner rather than later to enable us to tease out these sensitive issues. No child, irrespective of his or her disability, should be left without a proper and appropriate education.

The leaders should meet outside for a few minutes to try to reach a formulation. I was genuinely surprised at the swift passage of the Arts Bill through the House. That caught us off guard because we thought it would take longer, based on the experience in the other House. However, as Senator O'Meara said, that may be a good thing because it may mean it has been refined. Many Members wish to speak in the debate on health. Perhaps we could extend the time for that. However, it depends on Ministers being available.

Senator Brian Hayes also mentioned Sellafield and planning issues. I said yesterday that a debate on planning had been arranged for a particular week, but the Minister became ill. I hope to rearrange that debate.Senator O'Toole agreed with Senator Brian Hayes. He also raised the issue of Kenmare fishing rights. We will try to find out the current position. The Senator asked that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should come into the House for a debate on the issue.Senator O'Meara mentioned the tribunals and the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning on the radio. Timing is everything. If any of us had said 12 months ago what we said in the House this morning about the tribunals, we would be arraigned and everyone would be writing articles about how awful we were in trying to impede the course of justice. However, time has moved on and the insane length of time which has elapsed has left us reeling.As I left the office this morning a letter came through on the fax machine from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, asking me to convey to the House certain matters regarding the tribunal. I did not have time to read it, but I will bring it to the House tomorrow. I will send it to everyone in the meantime because the Houses of the Oireachtas set up the tribunal.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	52	That has already been circulated.

The Minister asked me to convey certain matters to the House.Senator O'Meara also raised the issue of disability and the ombudsman idea, which has been floated. There seems to be a view on all sides that we can advance that cause in a positive atmosphere, which would be good.Senator Mansergh asked that the Minister for Transport should come into the House to discuss a range of related issues, including the toll roads. He will be here to take a Bill, but we will try to get him to come into the House for a discussion next week.Senator Finucane agreed with Senator O'Toole about the Kenmare fishing rights. He also mentioned the tribunals. As regards the cost of the tribunals and the money accruing to lawyers, they are entitled to their fees. Each person is available for hire. We have been told the tribunal has brought in a huge amount of money through the Revenue Commissioners.Senator MacSharry asked for a debate on planning issues and he also mentioned the tribunals. I agree that we must make endeavours in that regard. I accept Senator Dooley's point that we want a proper debate with all the attendant issues fleshed out. He also raised the issue of the tribunals.Senator Norris raised the issue of drugs and the fact that the use of crack cocaine is rampant in Dublin and is in danger of becoming an epidemic. He also mentioned domestic partnerships. He asked if more help should be provided for people who wish to introduce Private Members' Bills in this House. A parliamentary counsel is available to help Members who wish to do that. I accept the Senator's point. Perhaps the reform committee could take that on board and bring it forward.

When I heard the amount mentioned this morning, I thought it was quite small. However, I understand how people in business must feel if they have to pay extra wages. The Senator asked that the Tánaiste come to the House. I will try to advance that matter.Senator Browne said the length of time the tribunals were taking was absurd. We do not know if the minimum wage applies to students. However, we should inquire about that.Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned the Special Olympics and asked if we could debate the issue of disability in a civilised manner. That should be possible. The games have generated a positive spirit. We are all enhanced by them. It is great to read about them, to look at them, to hear the commentators' comments and to see the joy on everyone's faces. Perhaps that will encourage us to think about what we could do to advance the cause of people with disabilities. It would be great if the games were the springboard for that.Senator Ulick Burke brought up the case of the child with spina bifida in Donegal who cannot access toilet facilities. I am sure the Minister and the Department are attending to that problem, but I will try to get up-to-date information on that case.Senator Dooley asked for a debate on planning. He also mentioned Dúchas and An Taisce. I understand from what I have been told – it may be anecdotal evidence – that many people who make objections are not domiciled in this country. They have an address here which allows them to make objections. People have rights. We do not want to go so far down one path that we rule out proper objections to planning applications. That is why that debate should be properly structured and we should get all the information.Senator Quinn mentioned the looming trade war between the US and Europe on the issue of genetically modified food. Perhaps we could have a debate on that issue in the first session after the recess. Senator Hanafin mentioned competitiveness and insurance costs. He also said that Hungary is now in the same position as we were some time ago.Senator Feighan spoke about the need for resources to tackle the drugs issue. He paid a worthy tribute to the volunteers who are working with the Special Olympics and the GAA. Croke Park looks magnificent. One would be proud to have such a stadium in one's country. He mentioned the bid for 2016, which is a splendid idea. Perhaps we should consider that and I could write to the appropriate authority in that regard. We have shown our plumage to the world and we have demonstrated how we can behave on such an occasion. It would be fitting to do that.Senator Ó Murchú brought up the issue of the illegalities arising from the preambles to consultants' reports, about which I had heard. This is something, of which every county council should be aware.Senator Tuffy spoke of rural housing and development plans. I have long held her point of view about the way we frame development plans for counties. There are local councillors and planning officials but the balance is definitely in favour of county managers and planning officials in the matter of county development plans. Councillors can give their points of view and so on but the professional jargon and the way the plans are presented can be a problem. There must be a better way of doing this.Senator Fitzgerald spoke about balancing rights in education, an important issue. I do not know what is behind the story of the child in County Donegal but intend to find out because it is something we should be trying to rectify. There may be something to it. I will check and report on the issue tomorrow.Could the leaders of the parties come out for a quick meeting about the timing of today's business? I will come back to the House when the times have been decided.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Is pribhléid an-mhór domsa a bheith i láthair anseo leis an óráid seo a chur os comhair an tSeanaid. The sole objective of health policy is to deliver access for all to high quality services. Services have expanded significantly. Today there are more people receiving care and support services than ever before. Activity has increased in every area of services. There have been substantial improvements in cancer and cardiovascular services and significant reductions in waiting times in many specialties. I have addressed this House before on the investments made in the health system and the gains made over the last five to six years. Notwithstanding these gains, I have often referred to the need to couple investment with reform. I am delighted to outline the Government's plans in relation to a reform programme for the health service. The programme outlined is an essential element in achieving the kinds of improvements in health care that we want and that the public deserves.The programme of reform which has been agreed represents the most radical change for the health sector since the establishment of the health board structure in 1970. It is important to recognise that this reform agenda is a central theme in the health strategy – it is not separate from our strategic vision for the health system. At the time we published the strategy we said structural reform would have to follow. There were complaints that the system was disjointed and that very often patients and clients were having to respond to the way services were organised rather than having services organised to respond to their needs. It was acknowledged that with a new set of goals and objectives, we needed to be certain that the structures in place were fit to meet those objectives. We developed the strategy as a national blueprint and then had to analyse the structures to see how they were suited to realising the objectives and goals of the strategy over the next ten years.It was with this in mind that under action 114 of the health strategy, I commissioned Prospectus strategy consultants to complete an audit of structures and functions in the health system. In tandem with this, as Senators know, the Minister for Finance commissioned the Brennan commission to deal with financial controls and management systems. The central objective in the terms of reference was to ensure the structures in place were the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future needs. Other objectives included in the terms of reference were to assess adequacy of governance, integration and responsiveness to identified consumer need. These issues were to be considered against the backdrop of the four principles and goals of the strategy as they related to equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness. At the same time, the Minister for Finance had commissioned an examination of financial management and control systems in the health service. The commission, chaired by Professor Niamh Brennan, focused on financial accountability and management issues but also identified the need for structural reform to support improvements.It is interesting to note that the reports have, independently of each other, reached similar conclusions about the system and made comparable recommendations. These two reports provided the background against which the Government made its decisions on the health service reform programme. As I have mentioned, our structures have evolved over 30 years. The basic structure was designed in different times to meet different demands. Successive Governments have set up specialist agencies, often to give focus to and protect certain policy developments. There are now 58 agencies operating in the public health system. This is simply not sustainable. This multiplicity has resulted in a complex and fragmented system which has become an obstacle to achieving improvements. Both reports emphasised the need to introduce rationalisation, standardisation and much improved co-ordination to overcome this fragmentation and give me, as the Minister, a realistic span of control over the agencies for which I am responsible.Both reports also reiterated the need to clarify roles between the Department and the delivery system. They also drew attention to the tensions between local representation and decision making vis-à-vis national policy objectives. It is obvious that in a system as complex and broad in scope as the health service, clarity about roles and accountability must be completely clear. The Brennan report focused on this area and made specific recommendations which have also been endorsed in the reform programme.Other issues raised related to the way things get done in the system. The need to enhance needs assessment and service planning was raised. If we are serious about putting people at the centre of care, we must begin with an assessment of needs which informs us about how to plan our services. In turn, once we have declared and agreed service plans we must link such plans with funding and measure activity and outcomes. Both reports had a focus on outcomes and the necessity of being vigilant and focused on health outcomes as well as value for money outcomes.The Government has taken these reports on board and agrees with their analysis of current problems. There have been improvements in all these areas in the past but these have been part solutions that have only brought us some way forward. Part solutions, by their nature, are limited. The Government has recognised that it is high time to devise a comprehensive and integrated solution for the entire system.The principles underlying the reforms are a new national focus on service delivery and executive management of the health service, a reduction in fragmentation within the system, clearer accountability, improved budgetary and service planning and, most importantly, improved patient care. To reduce fragmentation, there will be a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies, with over 30 agencies to be amalgamated or abolished. This includes the abolition of the existing health board or authority structures. A health services executive will be established. This will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity.The executive is to be organised on the basis of three core divisions: the national hospitals office, the primary, community and continuing care directorate and the national shared services centre. It will have its own board and chief executive officer and the board will report directly to the Minister for Health and Children. The primary, community and continuing care directorate will be made up of four regional health offices of the health service executive, with existing community care structures at local level, to deliver regional and local services.The Department of Health and Children will be restructured to ensure improved policy development and oversight. There will be a clear separation between the executive and non-executive functions of the Department. Key to its role will be holding the health service executive to account for its performance.The establishment of a health information and quality authority, to which there is a commitment in the health strategy, will also proceed with the new structure. Its focus will be to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system by developing a framework of quality standards and to promote the strategic development of information, communications and health technologies within the system. This structure will be independent of the health service executive and the Department, the reason being that quality assurance must be independent. To have the provider guaranteeing the quality, is not the ideal way forward. We have already established the hospital accreditation agency, which is bringing a new focus on performance within hospitals. That agency will be subsumed, along with other agencies in this field, into the health information and quality authority.A new governance framework will be developed. All remaining boards and any new boards established – for example, the board of the health service executive – will be subject to audit against a new governance standard to be devised as part of the process. The purpose of this governance framework is to ensure that there will be common professional parameters across the system designed to deliver accountability, standardisation and value for money. Supporting processes, such as service planning, management reporting etc., will also be modernised to bring them in line with recognised international best practice.These reforms are essential to the advancement of the health strategy as a whole. Without them, the health services would not be able to respond adequately to its strategic objectives. The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. For example, Prospectus saw this structure as optimal in terms of allowing the primary care model the opportunity to develop and grow. I refer here to the primary care model developed under the health strategy. Prospectus also saw the advantage to be gained in distinguishing between acute and primary, community and continuing care and stated that that this structure provides the opportunity to "reflect the declared priorities of strengthening primary care and reforming the acute hospital sector . allow recognition of the different management demands of each sector in terms of scale, technology, organisation type and delivery mechanism."In addition, in the area of primary, community and continuing care, the reform programme provides for a strengthening of existing community care structures. I have already indicated on a number of occasions that services will continue to be delivered through these local health office networks. However, they will now operate within a fundamentally realigned national management structure providing a proper framework within which all primary, community and continuing care services can be integrated.With regard to acute hospital services, the strategy clears the way for a reorientation of the hospital sector around national priorities, high quality, best outcomes and better value for money. The structures emerging will support the commitments made in the health strategy in respect of the reform of acute hospital services. It will provide a more unitary approach to the delivery of hospital services, which, in turn, will support – this is very important – an even and consistent introduction of consultant-delivered services in Ireland.In regard to the information deficit, the health information and equality authority will provide the independent authority to support the development of information systems which are inextricably linked to the quality agenda in health. This strengthening of information systems will also provide a greater evidence base for proper monitoring and evaluation of system performance.Regarding accountability, it deals with the repeated criticisms in relation to accountability within the system, with greater clarity between roles, clearer lines of accountability and best practice governance. In terms of efficiency and value for money, it provides for the development of shared services, where economies of scale should lead to resources being freed for front-line services, improved standardisation and a pooling of expertise and best practice.The delivery of some actions in the strategy will be linked to investment and this will continue to be the case. However, improving value for investment made and structuring the health system, so that it can more easily achieve its goals, is a vital step. It will ensure that the system can absorb additional investment effectively and will help to demonstrate to the taxpayer and my colleagues in Government that any additional money invested will be well spent in delivering an improved service to patients and clients. The new structures must have a positive impact on the delivery of the Government's health strategy and that is its central premise.I mentioned the likely impact of the reform programme on acute hospital service delivery. I want to draw Members' attention to this issue because it is another strand of reform which will be put to Government shortly. I refer here to the report of the task force on medical staffing. The principles which are emerging are centred on high quality and optimal outcome. International evidence continually demonstrates that clinical outcomes for patients are improved when they are treated by multidisciplinary specialist teams operating in units where there are high volumes of activity and access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. It is neither practicable or realistic to suggest that we can provide this within immediate reach of everyone's home.We need to face up to these issues. As a society, we need to achieve consensus about the reality of achieving high quality, safe care in a country of this size and population.I wish to refer to one further issue before dealing with communications. In terms of democratic accountability, there will be three tiers to the new structure. We have already outlined our commitment to establishing consumer panels at the community health care office level. There has, perhaps, been some misunderstanding about what we mean by consumer panels. The idea of consumer panels is to bring face-to-face with decision-makers, officials and administrators in the health service those people who are either users of the service or families of the users of the service. This could involve patients suffering from a specific disease, such as diabetes, or those with an interest in physical or sensory disability or mental health. We would create panels involving the administrators and others at community care level, to help to shape and deliver services for the future.There have been some welcome developments on this front in recent years, not least in the mental health area where we have developed peer advocacy networks. There are now advocates in every area of the country who previously used the service and who are best placed to have some say in how services are developed in the future.At the regional office level of the primary community and continuing care tier, we envisage public representatives having the opportunity to articulate their views on the health service to the regional health officers or executives of the regional health office. There will be an obligation on the regional health office to apprise public representatives at regional level of the plans for the forthcoming year and to update them on progress made on health care objectives, etc. This is stated in the decision of the Government and the consultation phase in which we have just engaged – it will go on for three months – will, hopefully, flesh out some of those details.At national level, we see an enhanced role for the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in terms of oversight of the Minister and the health services executive. The committee already has a significant role in that regard and the Committee of Public Accounts has an ongoing role in financial and accountability matters. There is a Cabinet sub-committee, which was formed after the publication of the national health strategy, which is working on the ongoing implementation of this reform programme.We accept that managing the change programme will be challenging. We do not understate the enormity of the task ahead. Change is going to depend on the people working in the system. In that context, the reports do not criticise the people in the system but rather the system itself. They emphasise that our human resource is a key strength. Health, after all, is about people looking after people. The reports suggest that existing structures are actually hampering and stymieing the full implementation of that human resource potential.The first step in implementing the new structures will be an extensive programme of communication and dialogue with key stakeholders. I have already started on that process. A number of key groups were briefed on the day before the publication of the reform programme. We called in all the health service managers and the various agencies and informed them of the decisions we were about to take. We also met the chairpersons of the health boards before the formal launch of the programme. Since then, a nationwide series of seminars, which are specifically targeted at taking the message directly to the staff in the system, have been arranged. I have already visited three health board areas. I will visit a fourth – the North Eastern Health Board area – and where we intend to meet the staff. Following the meeting I had with the chairpersons of the boards, we will also be meeting the members of those boards – including elected representatives. We have also met the national partnership forum in health and representatives of the trade unions involved in the sector. These meetings form the initial consultation phase of the programme of reform. As part of the initial consultation phase of the reform programme, we have met with the national health partnership forum as well as with trade unions involved in the health sector.The Government decision provides for the commencement of a communication and consultation process, which I want to see completed by end October. The purpose of the consultation is to engage with people working within the system to elicit views on the best pathways to implementation and to flesh out the structural framework in detail. The office for health management has been commissioned to co-ordinate, manage and report on the process. The preparations for the consultation phase of the communications process are well advanced and the first sessions will commence within the system on 9 July.As an immediate priority, I will set about establishing robust structures to drive the implementation as soon as possible. This will include a national steering committee and a project office to oversee and progress implementation. The project office will comprise a significant number of people whose sole function will be to drive this reform programme forward. One of their first tasks will be to prepare a detailed project plan setting out a timetable for various elements of the reform programme, including identification of those actions that can be tackled early.The Government has also agreed to the establishment of an interim board of the health service executive as well as an interim national hospitals office. I intend putting these structures in place in the autumn in order to take early action on advancing the reorganisation of the hospital sector on the basis of the type of principles that, it is understood, will emerge from the Hanly report, which is to be published shortly. In addition, I hope to make an early start on the internal restructuring of the Department itself.I am determined to move forward as quickly as possible with this implementation. The decisions made will reinforce and build on the efforts to date in creating a more innovative and participative working culture in the health services, focused on continuous improvement in service quality. This programme is about formulating a framework for developing services and maximising the impact of these services on the patients who rely on them.

I will now have to ascertain the position with regard to Private Members' business, which may or may not require a further amendment to the Order of Business. For the moment, however, this debate will continue until 3 p.m.

He has been one of the most efficient Ministers attending the House and I thank him for bringing these reports to the attention of the Seanad. The Minister mentioned the need for communications and, indeed, the reports could take a leaf out of the Minister's book because he has proved to be a good communicator in articulating health problems around the country. He mentioned that additional funding will be well spent. While I do not wish to go back over old ground, much of the money invested in the last few years was not well spent. That is what the Brennan report is about and I hope the Government, including the Minister for Finance, will not use it as a stick with which to beat the Minister by arguing that whatever money has not been well spent will be withheld in future. Current health problems certainly require much more investment.There are three reports coming on stream, including the Brennan report on the organisation and funding of the health services. The latter report was commissioned to see where the health service can provide better value for money. The chairperson was Professor Niamh Brennan, professor of management in the department of accountancy in UCD, who is also academic director of the centre of corporate governance. Other members of the report team included Mr. Tommy Gorman of RTE, and the economist, Dr. Seán Barrett, so the Minister had a good team to work with.The Prospectus report dealt with an audit of health service structures, including an assessment of the extent to which those structures and functions were capable of delivering the quality and fairness envisaged in the 2001 health strategy.The third publication, the Hanly report, is ready but has not yet been made public, although these reports appear to have been made available to reporters over the last few weeks. The Hanly report deals with staffing needs in hospitals and the working group was chaired by a businessman, Mr. David Hanly. It comprised some 50 members, including Dr. Sheila Ryan, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board.

Among the Minister's recommendation is the abolition of the health boards. Opinion is divided on whether these boards are a waste of money but some people say privately that they are very political. I imagine there will be strenuous opposition to their demise. A little over two months ago in this House, I said that while the health boards were a problem they were not the overall problem. The Minister, however, has the political will to take on the health boards and the consultants. It will be a dangerous road for the Minister to take because he may not get full backing from his own party. Like the dual mandate, however, it looks as if the health boards will go and the Minister has set out his stall in this regard. The abolition of the health boards does not represent a panacea for the health services and, unfortunately, it could be seen as a reduction of the input of local democracy. The health boards had some plus points.Single issue Dáil candidates found fertile ground in the area of hospital action and they are the bane of the main Government party, Fianna Fáil. Such candidates were elected in Cavan-Monaghan, Wexford, Galway East and other constituencies. Those Independent Deputies are very effective and have brought a certain flavour to debates in the Lower House.People accept, however, that local hospitals are not appropriate for many major medical procedures; they do not have multidisciplinary teams to perform the necessary number of procedures to ensure competence. I know of some people who had to go for operations in areas which lacked the competence of larger hospitals.What acceptable compromise role can be arranged for Roscommon hospital, for example, in my own constituency? One of the key questions raised by the centralisation of hospital services is how long it will take patients, particularly those in rural areas, to get to hospital in an emergency. In such circumstances, ambulance services will have to be more efficient in order to gain public confidence. Every week, constituents tell me that they called for an ambulance which took an hour or 90 minutes to arrive. The Minister will continue to face such problems unless rural ambulance services can be improved.A restructured ambulance service is needed so that the Minister's reforms can be implemented. The existing service needs more resources, including funding, and more ambulance centres are required also.The N61 runs between the second largest town in County Roscommon and Roscommon hospital and has been included in the most recent national development plans. It is probably the worst road in the country. The ambulance service is experiencing many problems.The annual health budget in 1997 was €3.7 billion, while in 2003 it is projected to be more than €9 billion. This significant increase has led to what is perceived as a poorer service. That is remarkable because every cent of taxpayers' money will be invested in the health service this year. The Government has commissioned three reports, two of which have been published with the third due shortly. It is puzzling that three reports were needed because there will be a considerable overlap, but, hopefully, there will be benefits in the not too distant future. Everybody, including the Government, accepts that the Administration will stand or fall on the improvement of the health service. Hopefully, the electorate will be wiser at the next election and will hold the Government to proper account for broken promises and failures.The Brennan report highlights the absence of organisational responsibility for the management of the health service as a unified national system and notes that there are no incentives to manage costs effectively, with inadequate investment in information systems. This may surprise some people but, considering the performance of the service, perhaps not. The report is critical of aspects of the role of consultants in the service. That role and the parameters of the influence of consultants in the hospitals will not be easily or quickly grappled with because they are historic in nature. The Minister faces considerable opposition from consultants who will be key to making health reforms work.The role of the consultant as a private and public practitioner in the hospital service is a web that nobody understands and significant reform is needed in this area. Professor Brennan said she was absolutely shocked by the common contract with consultants. An increased number of consultants is needed. Current estimates put the requirement at more than 1,000 posts. However, this will provide an opportunity to employ consultants on a proper and equitable basis. The role and influence of consultants is significant and it does not do much good to demonise such an important sector.The key recommendations of the Brennan report are the establishment of an executive to manage the health service as a unitary national service, more appropriate financial control systems and substantial rationalisation of existing services. The report also recommends that all future consultant appointments should be on the basis of contracting them to work exclusively in the public sector, but this will not happen unless a serious move is made to sideline or take on consultants. Other recommendations include the reform of the medical card and general medical services schemes and publicly funded drug schemes.The report identifies the key problems in the health service as a fragmentation of responsibilities, a lack of cost consciousness, insufficient evaluation and analysis of current expenditure as well as a lack of accountability, transparency and probity. Three broad themes in the report concern the patient, the taxpayer and the staff of the health service.The Prospectus report recommends the abolition of the health boards, which has generated considerable interest. This is a flagship recommendation, as a result of which it is anticipated that everything will improve following the abolition of the health boards. I do not necessarily subscribe to that view. There will be a democratic input loss and, together with centralisation of administration rather than decentralisation, there will be a loss of local input.The Minister recognises the tensions between local representation and national policy. The health boards will be replaced by a health service executive to manage, as a single national unit, three core areas within the health service executive. These will be a national hospitals office, a primary care and continuing care directorate and a national shared services centre. This is intimidating and there is broad criticism of the hierarchies of bureaucracy within the health service, to which these changes will add.The report also recommends the establishment of four regional health offices within the health service executive to deliver regional and local services, which is confusing. The provision of appropriate local services is of primary concern to many people, especially public representatives in areas that are distant from the centres of excellence and service. This raises questions about equity.I come from a rural county and we will have to look to large urban areas for services. While I accept the concept, people are shouting about decentralisation, but health services will be centralised. The national hospitals office will be established with priority for reform in the hospitals area and a health information and quality authority will also be established and support services modernised. The thrust of the report is to maximise public funding, which should be welcomed.While the Hanly report has not been published, it has been leaked to newspapers and it contains a strategy to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors to 48 by 2009 in order to comply with the EU working time directive. The practical implications of moving to a consultant-provided rather than a consultant-led service need to be analysed. However, it should mean that consultants will be immediately accessible for clinical decision-making and treatment through a renegotiated common contract. The current contract was not well negotiated. The report makes several recommendations on hospital structures including the provision of a single speciality hospital, a national hospital authority, training reorganisation, regional and national specialities.However, overall, the reports are confusing and have been the subject of glossy production and hype. Not a single extra bed, nurse or medical card will be provided even though they were promised.

Again, the health boards are the whipping boys. I would like to see real reform. Major efforts must revolve around the reform of the health service as it remains to be seen whether it is out of control. The process of analysis, about which I am concerned, is a growth industry, but it has not paid great dividends to date and one cannot feel greatly confident for the future. However, I will not dismiss efforts to reform out of hand. We can only hope that they will work and bring much needed respite to the thousands of consumers who should have, as a right, the primary requirement of decent health care in the advanced society in which we presume to live.I wish the Minister well and I hope the reforms work. However, analyses, surveys, consultancy reports, policy reports and more restructuring are not needed.

I compliment the Minister who has been proactive in dealing with the ills in the health system.When the health boards were established, the county councils and county borough councils had responsibility for the provision of health services, the county manager being the chief executive. There was quite an outcry at the fact that this would no longer be the case. It was felt that health boards would not fulfil the various functions of the local authorities. That was 33 years ago and since then the health boards have achieved much.Time marches on, however. Nothing is cast in stone and no situation is so utopian that it cannot be improved. The health boards have achieved much. They can take much credit for the establishment of specialties. I am chairman of the Midland Health Board, of which I have been a member for almost 23 years. The board has set up a number of specialties which would not have been established in the region if there had not been a regional health board.When the health boards were set up, they were lumbered with a number of unsuitable institutions, many of which are still unsuitable for their current use. Many of our psychiatric institutions were built almost 200 years ago. They were certainly not designed to serve as acute psychiatric treatment centres, their current use. There is no point in crying about their closure because they are not suitable. Many of the smaller hospitals, handed over to the health boards when set up in 1970-71, are not suitable and many are surplus to service requirements.The Midland Health Board took the decision to rationalise hospital services in the mid-1980s. There was an outcry when we closed Longford County Hospital and discontinued maternity services in the Leader's own town of Athlone and in Tullamore. Time has proven that our decision was the right one. It is only in centres where there is a large throughput of cases that the provision of specialist services will be most efficient. This has been clinically proven by more eminent people than me.The Minister has taken a radical approach to ensuring optimum benefit is garnered by the people of the country from what they pay for health services. The national health service reform programme will change the health service as we know it today. It will maximise the level and quality of our services and create a system that is accountable, effective, efficient and capable of responding to the needs of every patient throughout the Republic of Ireland. It includes measures which will impact on every element of the health system and draw on the conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Brennan commission on financial management and control systems in the health service and the Prospectus audit of structures and functions in the health system. We will soon have the Hanly report, which looks at the whole area of medical manpower etc.My colleague across the floor asked the reason we have three reports. I say, "Why not?" They deal with three very important aspects of the health service. We do not want reports done by people who are jacks of all trades and masters of none. It is right that we have three reports because they deal with three specific elements of the health service. The Minister, in bringing forward the proposals, is taking account of what is stated in the reports.As chairman of the Midland Health Board, I was one of the health board chairmen briefed last Tuesday evening by the Minister, for which I thank him and the Secretary General. It was most informative and helpful. I understand the Minister is coming to the Midland Health Board tomorrow morning to meet the members and staff of the board. He will be very welcome. With the Secretary General, he is expending huge resources of energy on the consultation process. This is very important.The proposed measures include a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies. I said last Tuesday that it sometimes appeared that if someone had a pain in his or her big toe, an agency was sent up to deal with it. The situation had become ludicrous. This is an important aspect of the report. There was huge duplication and no one knew who was responsible for anything. There is to be consolidation and amalgamation of the 32 agencies, including the abolition of the health board system. Nothing is cast in stone and time marches on. The health service executive will be the first ever body charged with managing and delivering the health service as a single national authority.Several opinions have been expressed about the delivery of health services. If something is being done, it is wrong and when it is not being done, it is also wrong. The Minister is doing the right thing. I urge him to press ahead, irrespective of what his critics say. I commend him for this.The Minister proposes the immediate establishment of an interim national hospitals office to take early action in reforming the hospital sector. When a new service is coming on stream, it is essential that an implementation body be set up. The office will be one of three core parts of the health service executive, the others being the primary, community and continuing care directorate and the national shared services centre.Some time ago Senator Norris and another Senator tabled a motion pertaining to the inappropriate occupancy of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board region. They were so right. If this reform eliminates inappropriate bed occupancy, especially in the acute psychiatric services and accident emergency units, it will have done a good job. Our general hospitals have become general hostels and our psychiatric hospitals psychiatric hostels where people come in willy-nilly, disrupt the service in acute units, get bed and breakfast and head off the following morning, leaving a trail of disarray and a broken night's sleep for those who have serious psychiatric difficulties or other severe illnesses. If the Minister's proposals do anything to eliminate this problem, I will welcome them. They will do much more than this.Housing aid for the elderly is a wonderful scheme which has done tremendous work. It is currently adminstered by the health boards. It should be taken over by the local authorities because it is more pertinent to the services provided by them. The health boards are health agencies, not housing agencies. Rent allowances should also be under the aegis of the local authorities. It is ludicrous that health board community welfare officers must spend long hours adjudicating on and paying rent allowances. That is not their job.I ask the Minister to formulate legislation to deal with the abuse of accident and emergency services. To get drunk is a wilful act. No one gets a tundish and pours the drink down one's neck. If one gets drunk, arrives in an accident and emergency unit and causes disruption, there should be an appropriate mandatory charge and, in certain circumstances, a mandatory prison sentence. Doctors, nurses and health care assistants should not be subjected to the type of abuse to which they are currently being subjected by bowsies and whipsters and I do not apologise for making these remarks.The Minister referred to the re-organisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development, oversight and evaluation of service delivery. This is a root and branch examination of every aspect of the health service, therefore, no one can say the Minister is just hitting the bottom. He is not. He is starting at the top and working down. He referred to the establishment of a health information quality authority to ensure that quality and effectiveness of care is promoted throughout the system. Quality control is a very important aspect of any service, so why should it not be the case in regard to the health service? Health care is what keeps our very existence intact. The Minister also referred to the devolution of responsibility for budgets to people in charge of delivering services.The Minister is aware of my views on local authority members being represented on the health boards. I say this without apology to anyone. I believe some role should be devised for local authority members. They are a very important conduit both to relay representations and as policy-makers they take on board comments made by their constituents. I recognise that the health board system per se will not be in existence and obviously local authority members will not represent their constituents in that capacity in the future. However, some consultative role should be devised for them.The devolution of responsibility to the people providing the services is very important because no one is better placed to manage resources than those who deliver the services. These people will have to cut their cloth according to measure and there is no point approaching Camillus Glynn or any other chairman or member of a health board asking them to get on to the Minister for more money. The Minister will get his budget from the Minister for Finance and he must manage it. When the chief executive officer and the board get the money, they must manage it, and when the people who deliver the health service get their budget, they must manage it. This will ensure that the optimum benefit is gleaned from that allocation, both in the context of quality of service and the value for money aspect.There is the complex modernisation of supporting processes, such as service planning, management and reporting to improve planning and service deliveries. We have all been subject to consultancy services but we cannot have one in every town and village. We must accept the fact that there must be a centre of excellence. This is a little country measuring approximately 300 miles by 170 miles. In international terms, we must remember that we are no bigger than a cabbage garden. We have finite resources, not infinite resources.The Government has poured unprecedented money into the health service. Spending has increased from €3.6 billion in 1997 to more than €9 billion this year. It is important to point out that the money has delivered significant increases in output. Almost one million people were treated in our acute hospitals in 2002, an increase of almost 25% compared to 1997. Why is this? It is very simple. Our population has increased and we have taken in many asylum seekers. There are also two more important aspects, that is, people are living longer and, consequently, they are drawing on the health services more than they were in the past because old bones can be cold and sore bones. There is also a greater inclination by people to avail of elective procedures than was the case 20 years ago.There are 25,000 more people involved in providing health care. I disagree with my colleague opposite who referred to one extra nurse. The statistics show that the number of health service providers, doctors, consultants and nurses, has increased. In my health board area, the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, set up a college of nursing. Two groups of general nurses have been trained. As chairman of the board, I was honoured to present the last group with their certificates. We have acquired at least ten community residences in the last year in the Westmeath catchment area for people with sensory and mental health disabilities. Some of these residences are already on stream and more are coming on stream. Psychiatric nurse training will commence for the first time in 21 years.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to have this debate. I also welcome his opening statement that the sole objective of the health policy is to deliver access for all to high quality services.Having listened to Senator Glynn, I realise that I do not know enough about the health services, systems and controls in Ireland. I am a big admirer of his efforts and success in the past. I hope he will excuse me if I do not talk with that knowledge but by trying to draw on the similar knowledge I have in regard to how business works.I sought some advice by speaking to someone who has been involved in the health service for 30 years. She gave me a very good instance which was similar to my own business. She spoke about joining a small hospital in another part of Ireland, which was owned by the nuns. Because they owned the hospital they knew everything that went on. They watched every penny and also watched the patients and got to know them. She learned, as many of us do in business and in our first jobs, from being close to what is happening. She later moved to Dublin to a big hospital and she could not get over the difference that occurred whereby there was no ownership. Obviously the hospital was owned, or certainly the finances were owned by the State, but no one was keeping an eye on the pennies so that the pounds would look after themselves. There was not the same closeness to the customer in business terms and, therefore, to the patients.My attention was drawn to this fact last year when visiting the home of someone who received very good health care the previous year. I noticed a pair of crutches in the house which the person said he would have to return. He had recovered from his illness a year earlier but no one asked for the crutches back. When he went back to the hospital to return the crutches which he no longer needed, the hospital said, "That is interesting. We lose hundreds of crutches each year." I gather the same applies in other instances in the big hospitals because of the impersonal attitude that develops as a result of size. I am concerned about size being the answer to everything, yet I know in the case of centres of excellence we must have size. We will, therefore, have to find some way of ensuring that those who run hospitals get much closer to clients or patients.When I was chairman of a hospital some years ago, I made an effort to change the word "patient" to that of "customer" and I enjoyed doing so. However, it did not work very well. The consultants did not particularly care for the use of the word "customer". I was trying to impose a way of thinking on those who ran hospitals so that they would think of patients as customers. I also wanted them to think about the job we faced, as I believe was the case in that smaller hospital run by the nuns in the west. That to which I refer does not always happen with the authorities which run hospitals which become very large. It is this remoteness that concerns me. The danger of size is that the authorities that run hospitals often do so solely on the basis of financial concerns.The audit of structures and functions in the health service and the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service must clearly identify costs. What concerns me, because it is similar to what happens in business, is that one does not always get value for money. What has happened in recent years is we have invested huge extra sums of money into the health service and yet we have not managed to obtain value for money. However, it was not for the want of trying.I was in this House when we passed the legislation which set up the smaller health authorities. I was pleased with that because we seemed to overcome the problem of remoteness to which I referred earlier because the health authorities would be more easily accessible for customers. What happened, as the Minister explained, is that a huge amount of the additional money invested in this area was put into administration rather than into catering for the needs of customers or patients. I approve of the Minister's effort to bring efficiency into the operation. Let us ensure that, in doing so, we, and those who will be responsible for making decisions, will not lose sight of the customers.I do not like accountants. That statement is not correct because some of my best friends are accountants, but I become concerned when I read that the newly promoted chief executive of a company was formerly the financial controller. In such cases, one can see that the business, which was formerly run by looking after the customers, will now be run by an accountant, and one will see that organisation change. Businesses and hospitals must look after their finances, but if the person at the top is so concerned about controlling the costs and, therefore, looking after the customer or patient takes second place, we must find some way of imposing on and instilling in those at the top some way of getting close to the customer.On one occasion I walked around a hospital with the chief executive and realised that he was so removed and remote from what was happening to patients that it seemed to be one of the few times he had actually been on the ward floor meeting them. I know from experience that a customer coming up and practically grabbing one by the lapels and stating that they hate the way one does things and asking why one does them has a much bigger impact than reading a report which states that X number of patients are concerned about something.One way of addressing this problem in business is by holding focus groups and customer panels. I recall suggesting to one large organisation in which I was involved that we should have customer panels. The chief executive said it was a good idea and put customer panels in place, but the panels reported to a management consultant who produced more paperwork. It was very useful work, which produced good information, but it did not have anything like the impact of what I call "listening from the top". I refer here to finding some way in which the people at the top, in this case running a hospital, found a way to be closer to their customers or patients. One way to do that is to ensure that those who run the businesses or hospitals find time to be available on the floor. One way we do it in business is to have the manager's office on the floor so that he is available, contactable and approachable by the customers as well as everyone else.My other concern about the size of the organisations, as we move to a system with fewer authorities, is the development of bureaucracy and how we avoid having so many committees, so many meetings and so much paperwork. I know it is good management practice, but the more systems, controls, processes and meetings that exist, the less time is spent on looking after patients.One of the rules we established in my company many years ago was that we would never have meetings in a room with chairs and we held meetings standing up. We had meetings at 8 a.m. or earlier and no breakfast would be served until the meeting was over. It is a great control, a great system for stopping people from talking too much. In fact, on occasions it would not be a bad idea for this House, that we would have no seats here and we would have to stand. Perhaps we would not spend so much time on certain matters.The Minister also touched on the issue of looking at value for money abroad. My daughter lives in Paris with her three children and she has often had to use the French system. I am so impressed at the efficiency of the French system that I investigated it to see if we could learn something from it. It seems to work very well. One of the reasons for this is that the money for the health system does not come from a central fund and it is ring-fenced. As far as I am aware, this money is paid in by each citizen. The Minister is probably well aware of this and I know it is a difficult issue for us to handle. However, it seems that if the money we invest in the health system is coming from the big purse of the Department of Finance, it is much more difficult to plan in advance.I visited the Mater Misericordiae Hospital a few weeks ago and raised on the Adjournment my concerns about the closure of hospital beds. I realised at that stage that part of our problem is that the Minister is unable to disclose the budget of each hospital long in advance. The hospital authorities do not know their budget and are unable to draw up their budget in advance because we in Ireland do not use such a system. We use a system whereby the budget is allocated each year. The Minister does not have the ability to overcome that difficulty, but the Government and the Oireachtas will be able to help in that direction for the future.We have pumped a great deal of money into the health service in recent years, but we have not obtained value for money. The Minister is aware of this and is now putting forward a plan, which I hope will work. It certainly has got his enthusiasm and I am enthusiastic about what he is attempting to achieve with it, but it will not be easy due to the constraints we are placing on the Minister and on the health system.I also want to address the question of equity. When we, as a State, made a decision to provide a free health service to anybody over 70, irrespective of their means, it was admirable. It means, however, that some of that money, which now goes to the well off who can afford to pay for health care, could have been used for those who are in need of it.When I talk about financial equity and need equity, I am talking about the same decision we made in regard to third level education. We made the decisions some years ago that we would provide free third level education. It was a great thing to do and perhaps we could afford it at that stage, but it does mean that when resources are finite, then we do not have that freedom to look after everybody in that same way. Let us, therefore, ensure that, in making such decisions, we are aware of the need equity as well as the financial equity.One other aspect which concerns me is the power of the hospital consultants. I am not sure whether it is possible for a hospital consultant to have two masters and to work both for private and public patients. I heard the interview on the radio yesterday and I was stunned. I am not sure who the person was, but it was a good interview. It was about the consultants who admit spending only 20% of their time on public patients but who expect the State to pay 100% of their insurance costs. That is what I understood but the Minister is now challenging this. These are exactly the matters he should challenge. I fear that in the case of a consultant who looks after private and public patients, private patients usually get extra attention.I am also surprised by the fact that all public patients seem to be given appointments with a consultant at the same time. If a consultant's clinic takes place between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., all public patients arrive at 2 p.m. and wait. Private patients are given individual times for appointments. It seems difficult for some consultants to wear both private and public hats. I wish the Minister well in challenging this. We need to find ways to help him succeed.The challenges facing the Minister are such that he will succeed but only if there is political recognition on the part of all of us in these Houses to get behind him. This should not be a party political wrangle. There will be some tough decisions. I hope that when we come to seek centres of excellence, as we are, we recognise that we cannot have a hospital in every town. This will be a difficult decision for many towns and counties to accept. We must sure we do not use this issue as a vote catcher by candidates who promise to keep hospitals in their local areas in return for votes.I urge the Minister to show the enthusiasm he has shown in the past on this issue. He will succeed but will need the support of all of us.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister. In a debate during Private Members' time in this House last February the Progressive Democrats called on the Government to take early and decisive action to reform the management structures and financial accountability of the health service. I am delighted that the Minister has responded in such a positive way and congratulate him on the decisive action shown in the health service reform package announced last week by the Government.This is the largest single reform package any Government has ever undertaken. It is only the start of a process of reform, a process designed to put patients first and at the centre of health care reform and investment. This is about patients before politicians, boards and structures. It is a decision which signals that the way we have always done things cannot be the way forward.Everyone will be asked to accept change – politicians, public servants, doctors, pharmacists, administrators, etc. Everyone in the country wants change for the sake of patients. No one is exempt from change if we are to get the best possible services for patients and value for public money. We must all put patients first.From now on, the debate about health will centre on reform. We are making the investment; we now need the reform. After an increase of more than €5 billion in current spending on health since 1997, no one can credibly argue that all would be right in health if all we did was to spend more. Even the Labour party now accepts this. The Government asked last week to be judged by reforms and results. There will be continued additional funding for health, so long as we keep the economy working well, with high levels of employment, more economic activity and growth. The biggest ever expansion of health care investment was put in place by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition Government. Now, the biggest ever reform of health is under way, also led by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition Government.Unfortunately, political debates on health seem to concentrate on health boards. The Progressive Democrats' manifesto last year staed our management structures were not yet organised to deliver the best results for patients. We signalled that: "The health strategy provides for an early and clear report on health agencies and management structures", and concluded: "It is vital to all our people as well as all working in the health services to have health management structures that are tuned to delivering quality services and care for all".The programme for Government made a commitment to produce a full analysis and rationalise our system. The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition parties stated:We will seek the completion of the report on health agencies and management structures by the end of 2002 and will move forward on the principle of removing unnecessary overlap of functions and minimising delays in implementing service improvements.That is the Prospectus report which, with the report of the Brennan commission, has set out a clear agenda of change in the management of the health service. The Government has accepted the need for the wide-ranging reforms recommended. It has decided there will be a single health service executive for the whole country, with its own board and chief executive. It will be accountable to the Minister for Health and Children. The chief executive will be an Accounting Officer and, therefore, answerable for the executive's budget to the Oireachtas.With regard to democratic accountability, the health boards have been in place since the Health Act 1970. Now is the time for change. We should agree they are no longer appropriate for the governance, planning and delivery of health policy. This debate is not an attempt to blame health boards or question the integrity of their members. It would be unproductive in the current debate either to blame or exonerate any one group. We could go on forever analysing and decrying past mistakes and failures, sharing stories from our own experience and localities. It is the job of the Government to move forward, propose solutions and get on with implementing them.Health board chief executives have welcomed the reforms, even if some health board members seem less willing to embrace change. In response to the points raised by Senator Feighan, we should have political accountability and democratic control over health services. We need national policies to work locally. Expenditure on health represents nearly one quarter of all current Government spending. With 166 Deputies and 60 Senators, I do not believe we also need 263 health board members to ensure political control. We have a small population of 3.9 million people and are already very well represented politically. When international analysts say local decision-making can help in public health care systems, they are envisaging local populations in the millions rather than the hundreds of thousands, as has been the case for some of our health boards.The health service executive will not be remote from people and will have plenty of input from Oireachtas Members, consumer groups and the public. The creation of the new executive will allow a better focus on consistent service levels and budget management across hospitals, primary care and community health services. The creation of a national hospitals office as part of the executive will give a welcome national focus to hospital service planning and management. It is the only form of management and governance that can hope to address the issues that will be raised in the forthcoming Hanly report on medical staffing and hospitals.The Government will also be reforming the terms and conditions under which hospital consultants work. The Brennan commission of 12 independently minded and public spirited individuals underlined the importance of the common contract for hospital consultants for achieving hospital services managed to achieve best value for taxpayers. They said: "The key question is, how can the health services contract with individual clinical Consultants make it possible to negotiate with them, in a systematic way, the resources they need for their practices without interfering in any way with their clinical independence in the treatment of patients?"The reforms proposed address this question of involving consultants in management responsibilities. Hospital consultants are absolutely central to the effectiveness of health services. They set excellent standards of care and control who is seen, when they are seen and the resources used in treating them. The terms under which they are contracted by the State are also important to ensure we get equity and clarity in the public-private mix.The whole point of the Brennan commission recommendations was to align incentives with desired public service outcomes. To do this, we need much better data and management of information on what many people do in health services, consultants included, as well as tighter contractual terms.There have been many contentious points raised for and against consultants since the Government's announcements last week. Part of the reason there is such contention is that there is very little, if any, hard data on how consultants spend their time, for better or worse. This is part of the management vacuum. It would surely be better if we could debate and make policy on the basis of hard facts, not make deductions about how consultants respond to incentives implicit in their common contract. We do not know what consultants are doing. Many are doing superb work, well beyond what the common contract requires. Some are using the laxity of the contract to their advantage. How much time are they spending with public and private patients? We just do not know the answer.A consultant contracting with the State is not, in essence, much different from a public servant, even if the consultant is technically self-employed. We require teachers to turn up for a certain number of days and hours. We do not allow them to delegate teaching to others, allowing them to give private grinds during school hours, even if many would not use that option. It is not anti-teacher to make this stipulation nor is it anti-consultant. There is a role for delegation but there is also a limit to it. It is simply common sense public management which, I believe many consultants will accept.I was pleased to see Dr. Colm Quigley, president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, writing that consultants "are open to any set of proposals regarding amendments to the current contract". He said he had only one stipulation, that any new contract should be available to all consultants. We shall see what comes out of the negotiations with the Government. What is important is that a new contract should be negotiated and put in place as quickly as possible.With regard to the cost of drugs, I will declare an interest because I own a pharmacy. The Government will also be implementing the Brennan commission recommendations on controlling drugs costs. We will be reforming the way we pay for drugs; where a generic drug is available, the Government will pay for it but not the high cost of branded drugs, just for the sake of having a brand. This is a sensible reform which has been proposed by my party colleague and Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for which I congratulate him.The cost of drugs is escalating internationally and there is an obvious public interest in tight cost management here. The OECD report stated:The increase in public and private spending on pharmaceuticals has been one of the main drivers of rising health expenditure in many OECD countries in recent years, reflecting the introduction of new and more expensive drugs. Pharmaceutical spending rose by more than 70%, in real terms, between 1990 and 2001 in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and the United States. Pharmaceuticals now account for more than 10% of total health spending in nearly all OECD countries, and over 20% of health spending in France and Italy.In Ireland, for example, the cost of the drugs payment scheme has doubled since it started. It cost €140 million in 2000 and is budgeted to cost €280 million in 2003.The Brennan report puts the cost of pharmacy claims in the GMS at over €700 million in 2002. We cannot but try to control drugs costs. Pharmacists will have to recognise the public interest in controlling drugs and prescription costs. The Government will negotiate with them but if change is to affect everyone, pharmacists will have to be part of the equation.There will be many others affected by the reform agenda such as civil servants, general practitioners, health board management and staff and local representatives. I do not underestimate the scale and scope of the agenda being undertaken by the Government. It is big but the public deserves nothing less. It expects the Government to govern and lead. Taxpayers are paying public servants generous increases under benchmarking and Sustaining Progress. With nearly 40% of the public service working in the health area, the quid pro quo must be visible in health service reform. Everyone involved in the health service has the opportunity to show that the investment in benchmarking and Sustaining Progress by society will pay off in better management, flexibility and responsiveness to public needs. That is where the challenge lies. If any one group asks to be exempt from change, nothing can work. If all work together to embrace change, everything can work.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I welcome this debate. As the Leader pointed out, this House has been given the opportunity to be the first to debate these important reports which were published last week by the Department of Health and Children and the Government's announcement of a reform programme arising from them. We have already heard some interesting comments. I listened carefully to Senator Minihan, in particular. His pronouncements on the reform programme were delivered with even greater certainty than by the Minister, which leads me to suspect that I know from where the drive for this reform is coming. In that regard, it is interesting that the thrust appears to be value for money and how we spend it, not the priority of care of the patient or care being at the heart of the health system.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for restoring order. I wish I had more than 15 minutes because I have a lot to say about these three reports, of which we are debating two. The Hanly report will be the third to be published. It will constitute a very important part of the analysis of the problems within the health service and the way forward in terms of a framework for reform and change. I do not think there is anyone who will argue that change is not needed nor is there anyone who will argue that the health service as currently constituted has been able or capable of responding and performing, particularly in recent years, at the level expected of it.It is not surprising that the debate has focused on money because of the amount spent by the Government on health in recent times. There has been a failure by the service to deliver what we, as customers, to use Senator Quinn's phrase, would expect for the amount invested.When one looks at public investment figures, one has to ask why there are such problems at Crumlin Children's Hospital. Why are children waiting for chemotherapy? Why are appointments being postponed and cancelled from time to time? Why are large Dublin hospitals closing wards and beds? Why has the problem of waiting lists not yet been resolved? Will the reform programme being outlined by the Government arising from these reports make changes? Will it ensure that the problems at Crumlin are solved? Will it ensure that the large Dublin hospitals do not close beds? Will it ensure that people are not left languishing on waiting lists and forced to use a programme such as the national treatment purchase fund? I know the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is in favour of the fund and pushes it quite often, but surely it is an indictment of our system that we need to send people abroad for procedures, given that we are investing such a large proportion of our national income on our health service.I wish to discuss this issue in terms of the position at local level. Will this reform mean that the psychiatric unit at Nenagh General Hospital, which has been promised for 20 years, will be delivered? Has the prospect of such a unit now disappeared? Who can we ask about the matter? Who will tell us whether the psychiatric unit will be built and whether residential psychiatric beds will be made available in the county? Such beds are not available at present. How will this reform deliver change on the ground?With regard to the proposed establishment of a health services executive agency, the major reforms proposed by the Government include the abolition of the health boards and their replacement with this agency and others. It seems that the executive will be a super-body which will, in effect, run the health service. I presume it will be given an annual or five-year budget by the Department. What will be the composition of the board? How will it function? The Government has published a general framework of reform, which is not specific. I presume we will have to wait for the legislation to be published before we will discover how the executive will work in practice. I will be interested to learn about the size of the board. Who will be on the board? Who will appoint the board? By what criteria will the board be appointed? For how long will the board stay in office? To whom will the board be accountable?When it was announced that a national and centralised health services executive agency was to be established, with a brief to deliver on behalf of the Government, I thought of bodies such as the National Roads Authority, which is charged with developing the roads infrastructure. One would have to recall such examples, because hardly a week passes in the House without a Member speaking – not in positive terms – about the NRA. I will not speak at length about the authority, as I am merely citing it as an example of a board which has been established but which is not accountable to Members of the Oireachtas, as elected representatives of the people. It is remote from the people it serves. Senator Quinn made some valuable points in that regard.What level of staff will be made available to the agency, which I presume will operate from a building in Dublin? What direct lines of communication, instruction and accountability will the agency have to its regional offices? Will such offices simply be offshoots of the agency? I presume it will tell the regional offices what to do and how to deliver. These are very important points. Most people want to know how the delivery of health services will work. If one can understand the labyrinthine structures, devices and habits of the health boards, one can understand how the health service works at present. The public is entitled to know how the new structure that is being devised will work. How will decisions be made?We will need a further debate after the Hanly report has been published. I have encountered media reports and I have spoken to various people in the industry, for want of a better word, who are quite close to the Hanly deliberations. I am aware that it is possible that the new system will provide for large regional hospitals, such as Limerick Regional Hospital, which I hope will be designated as centres of excellence and which will receive the support and funding necessary to ensure they operate at that level.I refer to the mid-west because the Minister of State and I are familiar with that region. There will also be satellite hospitals, such as St. John's Hospital in Limerick, Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh General Hospital. If the information available to me is accurate, the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh will be downgraded from general acute hospitals to some sort of satellite hospitals. They may be day hospitals and it is possible that they will be driven by nurses. I do not know how the theatres currently in use at Nenagh General Hospital will be used under the new system. Will all consultants leave Nenagh and be relocated in Limerick? I suspect that they will. What will be the relationship between Nenagh and Limerick?These questions will be asked throughout the country and I would like to receive answers. People want to know about the future of their local hospitals. I want to know about the future of Nenagh General Hospital, not for parish pump political reasons, as some media commentators and people not associated with the area might suggest, but because it is important that communities in Nenagh and in similar towns throughout the country are informed of the level of health services that will be available to them. Who will deliver the service? Of what will it consist? What form of relationship will exist between communities and local hospitals?The connection of the people with the health service, through the political system and members of health boards, will disappear and will be replaced by the consumer panels the Minister has mentioned. I do not believe such panels will be sufficient because they are based on a weak model and will not be accountable. Will the consumer bodies have a statutory function? I presume there will be no such function, as I cannot envisage how it could be done. Whose responsibility will it be to decide who will serve on such panels? Will the members of panels be elected or nominated? If they are to be nominated, who will nominate them? Will people walking on the street be asked to participate? Will those who are well-known in the community be involved? I do not believe such a structure is sufficient.A consumer body, of its nature, is simply a consultative body. The Minister, the regional office or the health services executive agency may or may not listen or take the panels' ideas on board. I imagine that Senator Quinn listens carefully to the opinions of the consumer panels in his stores, as his customer is king.There is no sense that the patient, consumer or customer – one can use whatever phrase one wants – will come first under this framework of reform. The patient will not be at the heart of this reform programme because issues such as auditing, accounting, value for money and watching every penny will be priorities. I have examined the membership of the Brennan commission, which has produced a fine report and has done an excellent job so far, from a public information and public accountability point of view. It has given people details of how money is spent. I do not want anybody to say that the Labour Party does not consider this to be important, because it does, but spending money in a way that provides high quality health care for patients should be a priority.Health service workers, such as nurses or doctors, are not represented on the Brennan commission. Many accountants are represented on the commission, but those working at the coal face are not. The names in the Prospectus report do not mean anything to me, but I understand it was commissioned by the Department of Finance.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	84	It is the other way around. I presume that the Hanly report will balance that out to some extent.The issue of democratic accountability is important in the context of the reform and the total abolition of the health boards. One only need only consider issues such as the blood scandal. Democratic accountability is extremely important, as is the way in which the system of accountability is structured. I look forward to the legislation in that regard and I urge the Minister to take that point on board. Whatever way it is devised, accountability must be built in to the structure of the reforms being proposed.The Minister referred to an extended role for the Joint Committee on Health and Children. This is excellent, in theory, but it can only work if the committee is given the resources and the powers it will need to ensure accountability. Unless the committee operates on the same level as the Committee of Public Accounts, its function of democratic accountability cannot be fulfilled.My final point relates to the role of consultants. I wish the Minister and the Department well in their battle with the consultants. I have no doubt that it will be a monumental battle. There will be blood on the floor before this is over. The Department is taking on one of the strongest vested interests in the country. The consultants are coming to the Department with a contract that the Department negotiated which, in effect, gives them everything. They are now being asked to give something back and, in any negotiations when one is taking something away from a group, they will strongly resist it.It is important to note, however, that the wider context within which consultants previously operated is no longer the same. The consultant was always seen as the authority figure in a hospital and it is welcome that this will be brought to an end in the reform programme. In the same way as nurses, other doctors and workers in the health service, consultants are the servants of the people. I accept that we must pay people for their skills and level of education. We need their skills and expertise and we need to maintain what we currently get, namely, a high level of commitment from many consultants. We must, however, alter the current contract to make it fair and, to use the phrase employed by Senator Minihan, to get better value for money.In regard to implementation, the Brennan report proposes an independent committee, but I gather from what the Minister said that he intends to do it in-house within the Department. Implementation will be the most important part of the process and its success depends on the manner in which this is done. The Minister needs to reconsider the position.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The health debate, as I proposed earlier, is being extended until 3 p.m. The sos will follow, after which we will resume with the Arts Bill. We tried to get the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to come before the House, but he is standing in for the Minister in the Lower House this afternoon.I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister, Deputy Martin, earlier in the debate. I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, will be present between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.I congratulate the Minister, his colleagues and his team of civil servants on the production of these two fine reports. There is no doubt that the patient is at the core of both these reports as, I assume, they will be at the core of the Hanly report when we receive it.I was particularly struck by something I read at the weekend in regard to health spending. How could anyone say that there should not be reform when the entire income tax take for 2003 will go towards gross health expenditure? In other words, if we receive €9 billion in income tax receipts, a corresponding amount will be spent on the health service. That is a huge factor to consider and such an approach is unsustainable. It would not be possible to just keep pouring money into health without seeing any benefit to patients. While we welcome their publication, these reports are long overdue.There have been those who highlighted the fact that a number of accountants were on the teams that drew up the reports. What is wrong with accountants? They know how to count money.The patient comes first in the reports, which seek to reorganise the structures of the health service in such a way that the patient will benefit. That makes sense and I have no doubt that we will all, ultimately, benefit from this. I acknowledge that it will be difficult. Problems are inevitable when one is trying to bring about the kind of monumental change that is envisaged here. Senator Glynn referred to the fact that the existing system has been in place for almost 33 years and, as Senator O'Meara said, there is bound to be blood on the carpet. There is no doubt that there will be blood all over Ireland as this change works its way through.My advice to the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Department and the Government would be to adopt the Latin adage, carpe diem, seize the day. Reforms not quickly implemented lose their impetus. People will get tired of hearing about them. Once the momentum starts, it must be maintained. The proposal for nationwide seminars is a most effective way of meeting with all the interest groups. We must constantly inform the public as to what is happening to the health service and how the patient will benefit from what is being undertaken. That will be remarkable.It was not surprising that the media focused on the proposed changes to the health boards. They were an easy target. I admire Senator Glynn's generosity in the manner in which he dealt with the matter from his perspective, as a chairman of a health board.It was reported in the newspapers that it would be three years before health boards will be disbanded, which I think is far too long. There is a natural hiatus next year when the local elections are scheduled to take place. Who would want to be appointed to a health board which will soon become obsolete? I urge the Minister and his team to quickly put in place plans for the disbandment of health boards subsequent to next year's local elections.The Minister did not say that it would take three years or more before health boards to be wound down, but that comment has been made. That is only one small aspect of a huge range of changes in the health service. The health boards must be commended for what they have done over the past 32 years. I never sat on a health board, nor did I wish to do so. I never sought it, asked for it nor got it. Throughout my political life, however, I observed the operation of health boards and what they have achieved. It may be forgotten that I previously served as Minister for Health. I was in the Department for almost three months, so I know quite a bit about health boards as I met them extensively during that period. It was a short but fruitful period and an enjoyable one.The complexities of health care have developed apace. Technology has led to more precise ways being found to alleviate ills. Our ageing population places a different kind of demand on our health system. The structure of health boards sometimes led to people seeking things for their own area. That is not to discount the wonderful work they did, but there was an element of "look what we have here" involved. It is clear that one cannot have a centre of excellence in every village in Ireland. The Minister was right to point that out. We have to face up to that fact, as do the people of Athlone. Although Athlone is one of the biggest urban centres in Ireland, it does not have a hospital. However, we hope we are developing services in a much more community based way, which will be more beneficial to our patients, especially in relation to the involvement of consultants and so on.The vista is huge but it cannot be endless. I commend the way the Minister and his team are proceeding. I also commend the authors of the two reports. Anybody would love to have Professor Brennan on his or her side in a difficult situation – she would certainly fight the fight on one's behalf.I must warn, however, against the demonisation of consultants. There is no doubt that we need consultants in an ordered and structured system. Ultimately, we depend on their professionalism, hence my warning against the demonisation of them. Clearly, they will also have difficulties in adapting to change, as will every group now inherent in the health service. Each group will have to change and adapt but they should welcome this development. In the end, a country depends greatly on how it is perceived, in terms of treating its citizens in a proper manner with regard to health care.One cannot possibly cover the subject fully within ten minutes. I commend this programme of reform. I am glad it has been published and that there is a great sense of urgency and momentum about it. This must be maintained because, otherwise, we will lose out. I am reminded of the Shakespearean line: "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune". This must be taken at the flood and, if it is, it will have success. I wish it well. I know we will have many debates in this House when the three relevant pieces of legislation come through and as the programme develops and evolves. Let us take the tide at the flood and deal with it. This House has a strong record on health issues. I thank the Minister and his colleagues for attending here so often.Senator Quinn said earlier – I am not sure whether the Cathaoirleach was present at the time – that Senators should come into the House without breakfast each morning and stand during the Order of Business. Will the Cathaoirleach arrange to have the chairs removed from the building in the morning?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I am glad the House has the opportunity of debating these reports. I agree with the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, as to the urgency of implementing this programme. If implementation of the reports and reforms has to wait three years, they will have lost their initiative. We have had a rash of reports in connection with the health service, at local and national level. What has happened to the many expert reports during the years? They were embraced very readily and their contents regarded as gospel. However, after some time, the holes and cracks began to appear. I have no doubt the same will happen to these reports if they are not implemented quickly.As Senator O'Rourke said, it is important that the Minister and the Department should tell the people what is happening and what progress is being made. The reality on the ground is that the people – patients and their families – have told the Minister and the Department what was lacking and how impossible it was to get access to services. That is what has led to the reports. Otherwise, people in the Department of Health and Children would have sat down, cushy in their present positions, and allowed the situation to drift on indefinitely. The response we have had today is due to people screaming for change and, in fairness, the work of the media in going into hospitals and highlighting the hardship cases, the reality.I greatly welcome the Minister's opening statement that the sole objective of health policy is to deliver access to a high quality of service to all. With the greatest of respect to the two reports, we have to stand back and compare what we are about to put in place with what is in place at present. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister's comment to which I have just referred. If I was confident that the Minister, the Minister of State and departmental officials had the capacity to deliver that single objective, everybody would be happy and there would be no need for further reports.I am concerned, however, at the absence, in the reports, of any organisational responsibility for managing the health service as a unified national system. This makes one wonder as to what is actually happening. Is that statement in the report a clear indication there is no confidence in the Minister and the Department, which had the singular responsibility of delivering services in the past? As I see it, the finger is being pointed directly at the Minister and departmental officials on the basis that they had the responsibility and failed. That is true. Now, however, fingers are being pointed further down the line, suggesting that it is the health boards which have failed – that money has been dished out to them without response.Let us look at the policies we have and the initiatives which have been taken. As a member of the Western Health Board, intermittently over many years, I remind the Minister of State that many policies developed at ground level were incorporated into departmental policy. That was a bottom-up approach, whereas we are now about to get a dose of top-down approach again. The roles have been reversed, with blame being directed at the health boards and their officials in a wrong and misguided manner. Fault cannot be apportioned just like that.Those who say it is a bad idea to have politicians on health boards are entitled to their opinion. However, I shudder to think of what may happen in future in relation to local initiatives. How will they be recognised and monitored? Do we believe, for one moment, that personnel within the new executives will recognise what is good about the application of this new policy at ground level? The answer is no, because it will never get through the system – the network is in place but there is a gap. We are now going down a road which involves widening that gap and stifling progress on those aspects which were attractive and good. I do not, by any means, suggest that every aspect of the health board system was good. While it may be said that health board administration is top heavy, the reality is that many capable people work in the health boards and many of their good ideas have been put into practice, being incorporated into the Department's system. That will not happen in future, in the context of a top-down, stepped, tiered system from now on. If it works, I will be glad to acknowledge it but I cannot see it working in the future.In one of his statements, the Minister said: "The Department of Health and Children will be restructured to ensure improved policy development and oversight". That is paralleled by what is happening in the Department of Education and Science, which involves farming out various sections of the Department. For example, the examinations section was moved out but it has not worked well. In a recent statement in this House the Minister used the very same clichés – that we will have a new Department of Education and Science whose sole responsibility in future will be – in exactly the same words –"policy development and oversight". Where is the responsibility in that regard? Has the Minister taken such a lambasting because of his failure, with his departmental officials, in the delivery of an accessible service to the people. Does he now propose to stand back and let somebody else take the flak because it is too much of a hot potato for him to handle? If any Minister, regardless of his or her ability, decides to drop the hot potato and run for shelter, we will have nothing to look forward to except more disaster and failure in the health services.Let us look at what has happened with Department policy. The Department seems to respond to political pressure of one type or another. There are beautiful facilities, theatres and hospital wards lying idle because of the Department's failure properly to assess health needs. We are consolidating the same ideas today.I know we have two reports, but a third one, which is the meat on the bone, is missing. We are talking about centres of excellence. If the Minister of State decided to visit the accident and emergency department of University College Hospital Galway, he would see confusion. The responsibility for that must lie with the general practitioners. The days when general practitioners were prepared to work and to deliver a health service are gone. Health issues are now referred to accident and emergency departments. The Minister must tackle that major problem.I am sure Senator Kitt is aware of the situation in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe. I am sorry Senator Minihan has left the House because I wanted to tell him that when the Tánaiste visited Ballinasloe a short time ago on a sad and difficult occasion, she guaranteed that Portiuncula Hospital would be retained and that its services would be developed in the future. That is contrary to what we were told today and to what we are led to believe is in the Hanly report. Was it political expediency which prompted the Department to buy the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam? There is now a chain on the gate of that hospital and it does not seem likely that basic services will be provided for the large hinterland around Tuam.The Department has relinquished all its responsibilities in those areas and handed them over to the new executive. There is a failure to recognise the need on the ground. This report and the health strategy are aspirational. There will be hype about these reports for a while, but then they will disappear. I am afraid things will not change. I do not have the confidence in the Minister to say that things must be done because he has not shown any courage to date.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted to take part in this important debate. I attended an interesting launch this morning by the Minister on the nursing home subvention scheme which was reviewed by Dr. Eamon O'Shea from the NUI in Galway. He was fair in his comments about the scheme. He said there were many ways it could be reformed, but he did not castigate it. I feel the same way when speaking about health boards and agencies which will now have to be abolished.Dr. O'Shea mentioned the need for significant public investment in both rehabilitation and step down facilities for older people. That is relevant to what Senator Ulick Burke said. We are looking for a community nursing home in Tuam. We already have an excellent site and I hope the Minister will consider it. I know he is visiting Galway on Monday to meet the board and to discuss the reform package. I will be glad to talk to him and to raise questions with him.Everyone is talking about health service reform. It is no wonder Senators are interested in the issue and I am glad we have an extra hour to discuss it. There is no point in people talking about a Third World health service or claiming that it will get worse. Health boards have done many good things. Any service which can deal with one million cases a year and which has increased the number of cases by 180,000 in only five years is not a Third World health service. Dr. Brennan put it well when she stated in the report's conclusion that there is scope to increase significantly the efficiency and productivity of the health system in Ireland, in effect, to provide better services to those who require health care and better value to the taxpayer for the substantial investment in health services. She likened it not to a black hole but to a colander which had many leakages.I welcome what the Minister is trying to do. I do not agree with everything he has said, but I do not understand it all. It is not clear, for example, where the four regions or the local offices will be. I had hoped that the structure might be on a county basis. However, that does not appear to be the case. Perhaps it will be done on a community care basis. I recall in 1989 the local county health committees were abolished. They were advisory committees, but they were useful.If one wanted to criticise the boards, one should have done so when they were set up. That was a different time and we have moved on since then. In 1997 when Deputy Martin was Minister for Education and Science he said the proposal to set up education boards would cost £50 million. He thought it better not to establish them and I agreed with him. It is like the tourist looking for directions in Kerry and being told by the Kerry man that if he were going where the tourist wanted to go, he would not start from that particular point. It is the same with the health boards. I pay tribute to the great work they have done over the years.There is an issue about the lack of local representatives on the board. When the regions are established, it would be useful if we could find out what role local representatives could play. I welcome the fact there will be a role for Oireachtas Members. However, other people have been members of these boards for years.Reference was made to a health and information authority. We have not always had good experiences of setting up new authorities. One cannot, for example, question Ministers about issues or raise issues in the Seanad. I think in particular of the National Roads Authority. The health boards have had many successful schemes and they have produced many new initiatives, such as the drug free cafes in Galway which we would like to see extended to smaller towns. The housing aid for the elderly scheme has been a tremendous success in the Western Health Board region. Approximately 1,200 projects were carried out last year, many of them through FÁS. I hope that scheme continues in the future.A question was raised about wastage. Senator Quinn said that crutches and walking aids are not brought back to health centres. The Western Health Board has examined the issue of transport because it has a huge bill for taxis and ambulances. The health board has tried many ways to resolve this issue. I hope the new offices will continue to do that. Will families be able to help? Will appropriate public transport be provided? I hope all such issues will be considered.Some of the Dublin hospitals have stated that they are not prepared to take people from outside the Eastern Health Board Authority region as priority cases. I was appalled at the outrageous statement that operations or procedures would not be carried out in Dublin for people outside the provincial area. In defence of the Western Health Board and our major hospitals such as University College Hospital, Galway, no hospital would refuse treatment to people who were not from Galway, Mayo or Roscommon. I am sure this is also true in Limerick. The chief executive officer of the health board and the hospital consultants have never refused treatment to anybody from outside those three counties. Dublin hospitals should never do this either because it is important that whatever treatments are not available outside Dublin should be available in Dublin for the most deserving patients.The Brennan report referred to the question of times for appointments. I have come across cases in which large numbers of out-patients have been given the same time for appointments. There should be a better system: having more consultants working in the public area is important.Merlin Park Regional Hospital is very old. When built, at a time when the scourge of TB was prevalent, it was decided to put units a long way from each other. People must make their way from out-patient consultant appointments to an X-ray area in a different part of the building. One wonders how people dealing with broken limbs manage this. It does not make sense. This is one problem which should be investigated by the new office.Although I am usually supportive of the health boards, one problem I have found is in the area of disability, an important issue. The Minister is very kindly giving us extra money. Other Ministers have given money during the years. There seems to be an idea among the health boards that the money should be divided among counties not on the basis of need but of size. A little more is given to Galway because it is bigger than Mayo and Mayo gets a little more than Roscommon. That is totally wrong. Unfortunately, the same thing happens in relation to housing repairs for the elderly: the money is divided among counties with much political in-fighting. A county based structure would be better, although it would not be perfect. We would still have rows between Galway city and the rest of the county. I hope this issue will be dealt with by the new structures being put in place. We know the structures are lacking because the two reports mentioned this.The Hanly report was also mentioned. This is a very important report for our region. I understood it considered three hospitals in the mid-west and three in Dublin. It has been leaked all over the place – it is a pity we do not have it here for discussion. How can it state many hospitals are to be closed on the basis of its consideration of just two regions? Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe has been mentioned as one that will lose some of its services or status. This is wrong. The sooner the report is published and we can debate it the better because we are dealing with rumours and hearsay about the future of hospitals.I thank the Leas-Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak and thank the Minister for the debate he started. I also thank the Minister of State for all the work he has done, particularly in the area of disability. This has been a very useful debate and the Minister and his officials have done a very good job. They are already visiting health boards and coming to the west next week. It will be useful to see how the new system will work but we must consider its chances of succeeding. People say the same argument could be made for education – that it should be centralised – or agriculture but would it work? The health boards have done a lot of good work. Let us see how we will deal with the new structure.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome the Minister of State. I found these two reports extremely interesting reading. I have been reading reports on the health service for quite a while now – I remember when the Fitzgerald report was issued because it resulted in my having to do a great deal of extra work. Professor George Fegan, for whom I worked at the time, was involved with the report and I remember the grave disappointment when it was not implemented, despite all the work that went into it. The Fianna Fáil Party was largely responsible for its non-implementation. So much time and money would have been saved if it had been implemented. An amazing amount of what is being criticised in the health service was actually foreshadowed in the report. It was an attempt to prevent waste in some areas.The most important conclusion that can be drawn from both reports is that there is a dreadful information deficit in the Department of Health and Children. It will be very hard to move on unless something is done about this. Since Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister for Health and Children – about eight years ago – I have been asking for a population register in order that if we introduce a scheme, we will have some idea how many people will be involved and when they will be called for screening. When I asked for the population register to be established, Deputy Noonan was establishing BreastCheck. We then had no notion of how many women should be coming forward to be screened each year. Lists were being made up from the GMS and the VHI and people are still being left out now. The most obvious example of how important it is for us to set up a population register immediately is the medical card scheme for the over-70s, in which there were twice as many eligible to apply for a medical card than had been expected, at a huge and unexpected cost to the State. I hope a register is being set up and that this dreadful information deficit is being rectified because it is one of the most important things that needs to be done.In both reports great emphasis is put on the fact that the health boards are to be abolished. It is right that we do this, because there are too many. Like other speakers, however, I am not only interested in denigrating the health boards. I had to leave the debate for about half an hour to go to Cherish, the organisation for single mothers, of which I am president, and give out certificates. Ever since Cherish was set up 30 years ago, we could not have managed without the support of the Eastern Health Board and subsequently the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I hope the sort of personal attention that can be given – and was given – to various problems by the health boards is not lost in this great new mechanism, because it has been very important. Cherish would not have managed without it. I went over to give out certificates to people who had done computer courses and so on and were now going into employment. Initiatives such as this need to be encouraged. I hope that with whatever mechanisms are put in place, we will be able to take account of what people are trying to do on the ground.The Prospectus report deals with the amalgamation of various organisations. Sometimes I think I have sat on every medical organisation in the country but have now found out that there are a few on which I have not sat, such as the Poisons Commission. Some of the amalgamations seem very sensible but there are others about which I wonder. For example, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council is to be combined with the National Social Work Qualifications Board. I cannot see anything these two have in common, particularly in view of the fact that the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council is actually getting to grips with pre-hospital care, which is improving enormously – paramedics are being trained to a much higher standard. I would have thought the council would have its hands full without taking on a lot of extra work to do with social work qualifications.I wonder whether it is wise to amalgamate organisations just for the sake of saying there is a smaller number of them. It is perfectly sensible for the Poisons Commission to amalgamate with the Irish Medicines Board, particularly in view of the fact that it has apparently met three times in the last ten years. I would suggest that a rational look should be taken. Things should not be combined just for the sake of it and because it would look better to have a smaller number of organisations.The situation with regard to the vested interests, the consultants, will be one of the most hotly debated topics in the entire report. Professor Brennan has been pretty harsh in her criticism of my colleagues. In one part of the report she says that there should be core times when a consultant must be available to patients in the public hospital and a formal act of monitoring work commitment in respect of public patients. Absolute categorical monitoring does not take place at the moment and if she wants to bring that in fair enough – it is not in the consultants' contract. Any time we tried to monitor each other, within the various hospitals in which I have worked, it was found that 90% of people were doing far more work than they were expected to do under their contract. Of course there was the 10% who were not doing it and we all ground our teeth about them and wondered how we could do anything because others had to carry their work. That happens in every organisation.I am more concerned about the appallingly low morale within the health service, and particularly among the consultants and more senior nurses, than the fact that people have to be monitored. I am horrified at the hours some of my consultant colleagues work, starting at 7.30 a.m. and still there until 7 p.m. Of course there are situations where people are neglected. This can include private patients also.A general practitioner colleague told me that his child was in hospital for five days, albeit not very ill, and not once did the consultant see the child. He did not bother doing anything about it because the child was well catered for by the registrars on duty. There will be incidences like that, so it is not just public patients who are left to one side. I do realise that, as in all professions, there are some people who do not pull their weight, but the vast majority are doing a great deal.Much of the low morale is due to work not being done that was planned, particularly elective work. When an operation is cancelled it is terrible for the patient, but it is also terrible – particularly if it is a big operation – for the surgeon who has had to organise the entire day and arrange for a particular anaesthetist and maybe a radiologist. The waste of time involving all those people is shocking. In one of the Dublin hospitals at one stage they would phone me when there was an anaesthetist on duty but no surgeon available and vice versa. They gave up eventually as there was no point in phoning me. This type of issue is most unfortunate.I would not concentrate too much on the public-private mix, because 50% of the population is involved in private medicine. I would not like to see the House getting bogged down on that issue.The last thing I would mention is the drugs monitoring scheme and the use of generic drugs. I am particularly glad the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is here because he has a professional background as a pharmacist and we have talked about it outside this House. I have read the Forfás report on embedding the pharmo-chemical industry in Ireland and wondered if the health service was not contributing to it by the fact that the Government pays very high prices to pharmaceutical companies for drugs, which are much cheaper in other countries. The Government could do much in this regard. Of course we could buy generic drugs, although they would probably have to be branded generics. The Minister is aware, I am sure, that in Brazil, a very big producer of pharmaceutical drugs, 20 patients died recently from some sort of injectable radiological compound that was being made under totally unsuitable conditions. Six patients lost their sight owing to the effects of an eye gel which was being used in operations, probably for detached retina or something like that. We do have to be sure we have proper quality medicines.It is important to remember that the medical profession's responsibility is to the patient, first and foremost. One cannot get away from that. It is ethically at the centre of what a doctor has to do. If doctors are being asked constantly to look at the accountancy side of things, naturally they get anxious. In neither report is the question of litigation addressed and it costs the health service in Ireland a fortune. There is four times more litigation in this country than in Britain. The awards given in the courts are four times higher than on the neighbouring island. I would like this to be addressed. I realise the Minister hopes to introduce enterprise liability on 1 July.Officials in the Department of Health should talk to Deputy Jim Glennon who set up Medisec, a medical indemnity scheme for general practitioners. The fees for that were very small when they started, but after five years the amount of money general practitioners had to pay to be part of the scheme had to be doubled. This is one area that I am particularly sorry neither report has addressed. The Minister's Department pays a fortune for that, as he well knows.Hospital rationalisation is essential. I have argued in this House that places such as Mullingar, Tullamore and Portarlington must get some centre of excellence for breast cancer. I am told that no woman from Mullingar or wherever will have to travel. This attitude must be overcome because we cannot have MRI scans at every crossroads.I thank the Minister. I do hope something happens as a result of these reports. I have seen so many reports which have not led to action that I am just a bit pessimistic.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome this ambitious and challenging reform programme which he, with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Department have set before us.It represents a huge challenge to address serious ongoing problems in the health service despite the phenomenal investment in recent years. Some commentators such as Colm Rapple have estimated that there was probably more investment in net additional terms in the health service than in all the other sectors put together. I am not sure he is correct, but it is a statistic he put forward two or three years ago in the media. Either way, the extent of the increased investment in the health service is quite spectacular. One quarter of entire public expenditure is accounted for by health – in excess of €9 billion, which is almost the entire income tax take. It is frightening that such quantities of money are invested in a service, which by its nature is extremely wide ranging and touches every community. It will also continue to expand, given the demographic changes that have taken place. The challenges facing the Minister and the Department will be correspondingly greater.Looking into the future I am reminded of the words of the poet, Brendan Kenneally:Though we live in a world that thinks of endingthat always seems about to give insomething that will not acknowledge conclusioninsists that we forever begin.I am certain that apparently daunting challenges such the ones currently before the Minister and his colleagues never thwarted him. I have no doubt the words encapsulated in that little verse are similar to those that inspired him and his colleagues to embark on the challenging road ahead. There is a certain amount of pessimism as to the degree of commitment he is bringing to the task. I do not share this pessimism because I am aware of the commitment he shares with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to take on the challenge constantly to reform the health service. It should be a service, not about politics, which is deeply embedded in it through public representation, but about patient care and service to the community. In my recollection, however, there never has been an issue so politicised.The Brennan and Prospectus reports contain recommendations for the future funding and structures of the health service. In addition, the forthcoming Hanly report will deal with interrelated issues which form an integral package for the successful delivery of a regionally-based, multidisciplinary, specialised health service at local level. According to the best placed sources, the Hanly report on medical staffing, which is to be presented to the Minister, but which has not yet been fully signed over by the parties involved, seems to be putting forward principles consistent with his thinking.The report also appears to be in line with international evidence which demonstrates that clinical outcomes for patients are improved when they are treated by multidisciplinary specialist teams operating in units with high rates of activity and access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. We will have to face the fact that such a multidisciplinary service cannot be made available on every doorstep. As with the education sector, such specialised, widely available services cannot be provided in either the health sector.Up to the 1980s, successive Governments sought to upgrade and modernise our second level education system. The Minister of State's relative, the late Donogh O'Malley, was one of the great inspirations who, as Minister for Education, brought secondary education into the modern era. It is a coincidence that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is here because this is central to what I wanted to say. Donogh O'Malley was an inspiring figure who saw the true value of free second level education, which he provided in the 1960s.From the 1950s onward, communities debated the need for secondary schools at every crossroads and street corner. The arguments were based on the premise that if primary education could be made generally available, why could the same not be done in respect of secondary education. That debate did not take account, however, of what was already happening in the primary sector, which was moving away from the national school structures that had already existed for the best part of a century. In addition, it failed to take account of the rapidly changing thinking on the need for a more rounded education, involving a wider choice of subjects, and the need for greater resources, including specialised teaching and improved facilities.There was also a need to address inadequacies by providing specialised remedial services within the school system. The need for such changes was already apparent but had not been taken into account by those who were arguing, with the best interests of their communities at heart, for second level schooling on every doorstep. At that time, amalgamations were taking place at primary level in response to ever-growing demands, some of which were financial.The same argument applies to the delivery of future health care services. The highest quality of care to meet an ever-increasing demand for a huge range of needs, can only be delivered at centres where the widest range of specialist expertise, including research and other facilities, is available together with the most up-to-date surgical technology. That, however, is where the parallel between health and education ends. Centres offering the widest choice and richest resources of educational expertise and facilities, can be accessed by a school transport system. Access to health care by remote communities will be challenged by conflicts between the pressures inherent in regional hospitals catering for ever-increasing patient numbers and the perceived urgent needs of distant local communities or, for that matter, individual patient concerns.The continuation of existing community care facilities has been flagged, but, even if they are upgraded, I am convinced that such structures will not fill the gap by ensuring that there is a proper balance in meeting these potentially conflicting needs.Accountability is required, both nationally and locally, but the reports point directly and significantly to a lack of accountability within the current system at national level, despite a huge commitment and investment by the Minister and his Ministers of State. If accountability is required nationally, then, equally, it is needed locally. At national level, the health executive and its three core pillars will have to be accountable to the Minister and, through him, to the Dáil and Seanad, as well as the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.The structures will be a national watchdog for the implementation of this new, exciting and challenging, yet difficult, programme of renewal and modernisation in the health services. If the pillars were not considered to be essential as a conduit for accountability, I presume they would not have been sought through legislation. The Minister intends to introduce such legislation to make them accountable in that way. The corollary is that, both locally and nationally, a network of watchdogs will be required to ensure a fair balance between potentially conflicting needs. Sooner or later, I believe it will be sooner, local representatives, including councillors, will have to act as community watchdogs.We have started down the road of separating national and local government representation by removing the dual mandate. I reluctantly supported that move because it was the right thing to do for the future. The evolving role of the national politician is seen as being distinctly separate to that of community representatives, although they are interrelated. A new and evolving role is envisaged for local councillors to represent local and community issues across all service sectors. It is both inconsistent and inconceivable, therefore, that local councillors would be left out of the frame in these new proposed structures.With the abolition of health boards there is certainly a case for fewer councillors, but, equally, there is an indisputable case that the lacuna which will exist at community level can best be filled by locally elected public representatives. Any role these councillors may be given will clearly have to be compatible with and integrated into the new implementation structures. If the new structures need to be accountable nationally, they must surely be called upon to account for themselves locally.Just as councillors should have a new local role and given that all other structures will be transformed, now is the most appropriate time to deal effectively and thoroughly with the role of consultants in our public health services and the practices that have developed from that role in recent years. From summaries I have read, I understand that the Brennan report points directly to the role of consultants and the best place to start is with their contracts.Two years ago, as a humble Senator, I had the misfortune to cross consultants in the House and, as a result, I incurred their wrath and fury.

It is a sign of the way in which the House has evolved that it is the first Chamber in which they are being debated.The Government parties have been in power for more than six years. For the majority of that time, there has been unprecedented economic activity. No Government had as much money at its disposal and there was never a more opportune time to reform the health service, as funding was available and public services were not strained. It was remiss of those parties not to engage in reform of this magnitude and a genuine opportunity was missed.Proposals to reform the health service should focus on a decent standard of service, a high level of accessibility and equality for all. Those are the rocks on which a good health service should be founded. The national health strategy was launched two years ago amid massive inequality in the system. However, that is still the case in terms of caring for public and private patients. Waiting lists are as long as ever and the opportunity to reform the health service was not seized.The health strategy is defunct, but it was doomed from the beginning because, two weeks prior to its launch, the Minister for Finance told the Minister for Health and Children that he would not allocate funding for it. The strategy was launched amid great pomp and ceremony. It was detailed and was consumed by the media and everybody with an active interest in the health service. However, the lack of funding spelt the strategy's death knell before it could be rolled out.People availing of the health service are the most affected by cutbacks in public expenditure. For example, 25 surgical beds were closed recently in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. The hospital had more beds when it opened in 1957 than is currently the case. The reports before the House have been termed in certain quarters as the most extensive reform programme of the health service in more than 30 years. However, the central deficiencies in the administration of our health system are not addressed as they should be in comparison to the technical aspects of how the system should be managed. That is the crux of the debate. For example, issues such as accessibility and quality of care are superseded by bureaucracy and administrative accountability. While those are necessary, the direction the health service takes needs to be prioritised.The patient needs decisions to be taken about practical measures that can increase service and treatment available to him or her, not more analyses, so that he or she will not have to wait months and, in some cases, years to access absolutely necessary treatments. The reports are largely accountant-driven and there is nothing wrong with that. Details that affect costing must be examined and accountants are experts in this regard. However, we must be mindful that the patient must be at the core of reform of the health services and the administrative and technical details must come second to the patient at all times.The administrative reform and the view of accountants about how the service should be run is useful in terms of identifying shortcomings, of which they are many. We should not denigrate the status of accountants, but we must remain cognisant of the fact that the patient should be at the centre of far-sighted reform of the health service.In principle, the Labour Party does not oppose the establishment of a single authority to manage the acute hospital system, nor does it oppose the reduction in the number of health boards. Three more were set up over the past two years in the Dublin area, which highlights the administration issue. A number of people have been saying for a long time that health boards should be abolished, while others recognised the positive role they play. However, the abolition of health boards will mean the abolition of a core element of our democratic system.As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, councillors have made an important and valuable contribution to the development of the health service through their membership of health boards. That role should never be underestimated. For example, councillors in my county representing all parties have attended health board meetings and fought strenuously for projects to be delivered in the Cork-Kerry region. The proposed abolition of boards is causing anger and annoyance in many quarters but to make an omelette, one must break eggs. If one is to be far-sighted, proactive and positive in terms of reform of the health service, difficult and critical decisions must be made, particularly if patients benefit.It would be dangerous if measures were taken to make the delivery of community health services less accessible to the people that they are intended to help. The performance of such services has been second to none and one only has to look at one's own area to see the role they have played. One should never look too lightly upon that important role, which is a principal element of democratic accountability within the health service.Much attention has focused on the proposal to remove political representatives from health boards, but there is more to the reforms than that. Sometimes people focus too much on certain issues without examining the entire package. However, accountability must be maintained because, if it is not, the public will lose faith and projects will not be supported. The funding of the reforms is critical, given that the national health strategy was shelved because money was not available. If we are serious about implementing changes as radical as these, funding must be provided and the Minister should spell out from where it will be generated and how much will be allocated.I visited the website of the Irish Medical Times to sample the professional commentary on these reports. Professor Brennan advises that the appointment of the first chief executive officer must be made through open competition and I would like the Minister to comment on that.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I am grateful to Senator McCarthy for giving me this opportunity because I had not intended to say anything. However, I am happy to be able to do so.Deputies Martin and O'Malley are good and caring Ministers, but health is a poisoned chalice. It is one of the most difficult areas politically for any party to address. The problem is that more and more money is spent, but the customers are less and less satisfied. There is a series of reasons for that. New medical technology is available and ailments that were untreatable and incurable ten, 15 or 20 years ago can now be treated successfully. It is tantalising for someone with a painful or terminal ailment to know that treatment is available but that he or she cannot avail of it. It is the ultimate in tantalisation.Services are much more expensive now. In my day, people went into a corner and died of an inward pain and that was it. They acknowledged that we are all perishable goods. Now people think that sickness is an insult visited upon them by Government and they expect to be cured. That will not happen because we are perishable goods and we will all croak at some stage. However, within the health service, things need to done and I am glad that there will be rationalisation. We have too many health boards and there are 58 agencies in the system, 30 of which will be abolished. I hope that this is done in a focused way and that there will not be abolition merely for the sake of cutting things out.I welcome the opportunity to speak because I visited an elderly Hungarian relative in St. Vincent's Hospital yesterday. I have nothing but praise for the nursing staff there; they are absolutely wonderful. We are blessed with regard to the Irish and foreign nursing staff working in our hospitals. We will lose those wonderful nurses from the Philippines because of the technicality that we will not allow their spouses to come to this country and work. That needs to be addressed because we will be in real difficulty if we lose this element, to which we have become accustomed. It would not be any skin off our noses if we let them in and permitted them to work.I looked at the ward where my relative was being wonderfully looked after. In an excellent hospital in Dublin, the ward of 30 people had one ancient bath, no shower and one lavatory. The bathroom was crowded with all kinds of other bits and pieces of medical paraphenalia. How they get the poor old people in and out I simply do not know. There were six people per division of the open ward. Some of them are dying and, while I was there, some were making involuntary noises. A radio was playing somewhere. The people were very ill, elderly and in considerable discomfort. Of the 30 people in this acute surgical ward, there were five for whom nothing more can be done but there is no place to send them. They are occupying five beds which are needed by acutely ill people in need of treatment. In a very gentle and nice way, this was explained to me by a member of the staff who is aggrieved on behalf of the patients and who is well motivated. I am not saying this in any partisan way.I blithely accept this situation because the health service is so much better than it was in my day. There is a huge difference between the current position and that which obtained 30 years ago, when I was in my 20s. It is fantastic, but people's expectations are so much higher now. However, I was confronted with what I saw yesterday, with the smell and with the lack of shower and lavatory facilities. It would be good if the Minister and Ministers of State visited these wards. Perhaps they have done so. They should listen to the nurses and try to do something. I know that would be very much appreciated.The Minister of State has my sympathy. The Department of Health and Children is the martyr's pitch. If I were in national politics as a party person, I would not touch it with a barge pole.Why should we pay for the private part of consultants' insurance? Let them pay for it themselves while we pay for the public part. The Minister could make a few savings there and spend the money on installing extra showers and lavatories in a couple of wards in St. Vincent's Hospital.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate him and the Minister for Health and Children on the publication of two excellent reports.After 30 years, it is self-evident that the system of health service needs to change. Each year, €9.2 billion is spent on the service, which is the biggest public sector employer in the State. Nearly 1 million people were treated in acute hospitals last year and there were almost 60 million GP consultations, but problems still exist. Both reports conclude that there is scope for improvement in many areas, not least in the day-to-day management of the system and in the financial and accounting procedures of that management.The system has served the country well in the past. The over 100,000 people employed in the health service have built up a huge reservoir of talent and expertise in a large number of areas. Both reports, and the Prospectus report in particular, acknowledge their commitment and dedication. They also point out that the workers, like their clients, deserve better. They deserve the opportunity to work in a system which is much better managed and controlled and which helps and supports them in offering the highest quality service to the public. However, both reports conclude that under the current structures this is not possible in many instances. As Senator Henry pointed out, morale in the system is very low. We must ask why this is the case.The Brennan report is a comprehensive analysis of what is so wrong with the system. It points out that fundamental flaws in the structures of management and control are obvious. They are too fragmented and no one person or agency is accountable for performance. There is no accountability for value for expenditure and no financial management, risk management or performance management. There is no flow of information between different arms of the system and a distinct lack of data on the level of costs. This leads to a complete lack of forward planning. While recognising the unprecedented investment in the service, the Brennan report concludes that fundamental reform in how the system is organised and managed, along with changes in the financial management and control, is essential to any attempt to improve the service.In my opinion, however, the mechanism suggested in the Brennan report is still too cumbersome. It would take us back to the multi-layered system where bodies report to other bodies which, in turn, report to the Department. The suggestion regarding the accountability of those people with responsibility for expenditure is to be welcomed. The targeting of resources for patients in the most cost-effective way and accountability for those resources is the only way to obtain value for money in the system. The report concludes that the arrangements that allow consultants to combine public and private commitments are unsatisfactory. This is one area of which most people will be aware and it has to be tackled. As Senator Norris pointed out, there is also the issue of medical insurance, which is costing the State €50 million per year.Professor Brennan makes a valid suggestion in the area of information technology. In the medical world, almost daily advances in treatments, equipment, medicines and methods of diagnosis are commonplace but our current system of running hard to stay still has meant that, in some areas, we have fallen behind in research and development. Ireland has a worldwide reputation in some areas, such as, for example, cardiac surgery. As changes are made, we can lead the way in many more disciplines. The waiting list for cardiac treatment in St. James Hospital in 1997 was five years. It is now down to nine months and less in some cases where immediate treatment is required. In other areas, such as maternity and gynaecological services, we have an excellent service and one of the lowest newborn infant mortality rates in the world.The Prospectus report states that we need "A health system that responds more effectively to the expectations of its stakeholders and achieves a much greater impact to the benefit of the consumer" and that we need to "build on the existing talents and knowledge of staff." I welcome the four major reforms proposed in the report, namely, a single health service executive, the delivery of value for money and management of ongoing change, simpler governance and greater level of accountability and a reduction in the number of agencies and the reports required from them. These proposals pose a huge challenge for service providers, legislators and consumers.These changes will not and cannot take place overnight. There has to be parallel action on a number of fronts and the Prospectus report points out that an incremental response will only exacerbate existing problems. It concludes that the way we have done business in the past has resulted in the dilution of the effectiveness of reforms and of investment. It also suggests that a fundamental shift in thinking is required and that we should take a broader view of how we develop the system into the future. The report goes on to suggest that the proposed changes will require leadership which is strong, clear, firm and sustained.That is exactly what the Minister is providing. The health service reform programme combines leadership with vision, takes the best of both reports, enhances the recommendations and gives us a pathway into the future which will ensure that all citizens, regardless of their circumstances, will be assured of a quality of access to a first class service. The restructured health service, as suggested in the programme, ensures accountability, greater efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of the service. It also supports and encourages the many dedicated people working in the service and makes sure they have conditions which allow them to offer the highest quality service to the public. That is what this country deserves and has a right to. These reforms underpin that right. While no one is saying it will be easy or that it will happen overnight, the Minister is the person who can deliver it. I was pleased to hear him point out to the House that we need to face up to these issues.A number of speakers pointed out various difficulties that arise as a result of these changes. However, as the Minister has said, we must face up to them. As a society, we must achieve a consensus. I congratulate the Minister on the programme he has undertaken of travelling around the country, coming face to face with the stakeholders, putting the proposals on the table and saying that this is the way we must go. I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and the staff on these proposals, which I believe are the way forward. I wish them well.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I welcome my fellow Limerickman to the House, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I want to deal with a specific local issue. I hope at the end of the discussion I will get a frank reply because I have also raised the issue on the Adjournment. This matter is very important to the community the Minister of State and I serve. It relates to the report of the expert review group on radiotherapy services, which has not yet been circulated. I understand the south eastern deputation got a frank response during the week. They were told by the Minister, Deputy Martin, that there would not be a radiotherapy unit in Waterford. I deduce from that response that a radiotherapy unit will not be provided for the Limerick area.It has been stated that health boards, particularly public representatives, are often perceived to wear a parochial type hat. I make no apologies for being parochial on this issue. The Caiman-Hine expert review group stated that there was justification for two linear accelerators for radiotherapy services in an area with a population of 200,000 or 300,000 people. There is in excess of 300,000 people in the Mid Western Health Board area, therefore, there is justification for the service. A state-of-the-art area has been reserved for the oncology unit in the regional hospital but there is one vital ingredient missing, a radiotherapy facility. The statistics indicate that there is justification for this facility.Given that the Government talks a lot about public-private partnerships, this was a classic example where the Mid Western Hospital Development Trust was prepared to put in the funding for the capital equipment and all that was required from the Department of Health and Children was to provide the finance for the people to be employed in that service. It is a retrograde step not to consider a radiotherapy unit for this area. I presume that by the end of the discussion today the Minister will at least be honest and say it is embodied within the report that there is to be no radiotherapy facility for the mid-west region. We can then be honest with the people in the region by telling them the facility will not be provided because it is not recognised that within the mid-western area the facility is required.It is important to put this issue in context. We are discussing the Prospectus report and the Brennan report. The reports were commissioned by two Ministers with two separate objectives. The Minister for Health and Children is looking at the organisational aspect of the report and the Minister for Finance is looking at the financial constraints involved. It would be worthwhile studying the reports.I would like to ask a pertinent question. The report states that 96,000 people are employed within the health board service throughout the country. It has also been pointed out by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers that there will be no job losses, therefore the 96,000 people will remain in place. If there was rationalisation within an industry, with a reduction in the number of plants from 11 to four plants, would there be job losses as such? How can one sustain all the management tiers if there is a reduction from 11 health boards to four regional health boards?It is worth bearing in mind that between 1997 to 2002, during the period of this Administration, the number of employees in the health board sector increased by a massive 28,000, from 68,000 to 96,000. During debates on the health service, we are always reminded by the Taoiseach of the massive increase in funding in the health service, which has almost trebled over the five years. Much of that money went into funding extra jobs within the health service. There was a dramatic upsurge in the numbers of people recruited prior to the election.The Minister should look at the administrative structures within the health boards to see whether consumers are getting value. I will give an example of a situation which probably exemplifies the frustrations of people. I recently met a person who suffered a stroke and has a specially adapted car. As she is going abroad on holiday and decided to take her children, she looked for an E1.11 form. She contacted the health board in Limerick and was told that they had the forms. When she asked for it to be put in an envelope and sent on to her, the person who answered the phone replied, "No, I can't because it is not my job. I will send an e-mail to the girl responsible so she can put it in the envelope and send it on to you." This person waited six weeks for the E1.11 form. If that is a classic example of an administrative layer doing a justifiable job, I would question it.Has there been a major improvement in the health services over the period of five years? One need only point to recent opinion polls which showed that 92% of people were critical of the health system. It is time this was examined. Will we seriously engage in the discussion on reform of the structures or will people spin doctor and try to criticise consultants, perhaps unduly, in relation to the document? Will people try to criticise the councillors who serve on the health boards and who receive minimal expenses in relation to the overall health board budget? Let us stop this scapegoating. If we are serious about unravelling this issue, let us get on with it properly without scapegoating different sectors.Much work needs to be done. It is worth bearing in mind that there are 58 agencies, at least 50% of which have emerged in the past ten years. It is very easy for the Government to set up an agency, commission or special committee and hide problems rather than face up to them. There is another essential component.The other report for which the Government is waiting will cause ripples of discontent throughout the country. Whatever we may criticise about health boards, one aspect we understand is local involvement. If the Minister sets up four health boards with a different structure, will this give the same professional service in the areas we all represent? We will wait and see.I hope the Minister will expedite this change as quickly as possible. He is being congratulated for consulting with people throughout the country. I would expect him to do that because he must sell this package. It will probably keep him in the news for a long time, just as it kept the Government in the news when it was announcing the health strategy prior to the election. It was to be the panacea for all the health problems. What has happened to that document? What has happened to the promises embodied within it? This is an effort to change the structure of the administration. However, it will not happen unless there is parallel development in relation to the expenditure required for the extra beds and teasing out the system in order to ensure that we do not have long waiting lists, or a queue waiting to join a queue to get on a waiting list. There are difficulties in relation to a whole range of surgical activities within the health board system.There is no neuro-surgery unit in the mid-west region. People must wait to go to Cork and many of these people die before they get to Cork. These are the problems people on the ground have. They are not necessarily interested in the administrative structures within the system. They hope the Government will solve these problems, but they are equally concerned that people with cancer or people who need to avail of neuro-surgery should have the facilities available to them. This is a huge criticism of the current health service. Is it right for a person with a young family of five children to have to travel all the way from County Limerick to a radiotherapy facility in St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin for a five minute treatment?I regard this as very serious. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, does not. It is not a matter for jesting. Those in Dublin have these facilities but we do not have them in the mid-west region. Rather than having to table a matter on the Adjournment to find out about an issue which is important for my area, I would hope to get an honest reply today stating that the radiotherapy facility will not be provided in the Limerick area so that I can go back and tell the people they must continue to travel to Dublin in the future for this much needed service.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	98	In common with just about every other Member of this House, I welcome the debate on the health service against the background of the Brennan and Prospectus reports. Health is never far from the mind of a public representative and it is the one subject which comes up time and again when we speak to our constituents. This debate is timely, and perhaps even overdue, but I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to tackle the problem head on and initiate a process which we have not seen in this country for over 30 years.We all are only too well aware that the health of the nation is costing us around €9 billion per annum. This is a staggering sum and if that is what is to be spent, then I am totally committed to it. However, I am convinced, from reading those reports, from my own observation and from what I have been told, that we are just not getting value for that kind of money. Logic alone tells us this is true. If anyone had told me back in 1997 that we would increase our spending on health by 125% in five years and add a staggering 25,000 extra personnel to the payroll in the health sector, I would have cheered and said that all our health problems were over. I would also have said it was a false election promise, which could not and would not be delivered on. I might have added that there would hardly be a Minister for Finance in existence who would sanction that kind of money, but I would have been wrong on all counts.We must know at this stage that the allocation of extra resources and the recruitment of an endless stream of personnel will not in itself solve our problems. To ignore that would be to ignore logic itself. For that reason, I congratulate the Minister on firmly grasping this nettle at its very core.We must all be aware that there are certain practices in our health service which are neither user-friendly or administratively acceptable. We also know that it will be very difficult to change those practices. We will be up against the habits of a lifetime, the perception of rights built up throughout a career and the possibility of interfering with fee structures or earnings which are both out of date and inappropriate to the climate and system in which we now operate. In short, we must eliminate bad practice and vested interests, maximise the resources available and examine every euro being spent to extract full value from it.It is surprising the number of similarities there are between the two reports before us. I want to give two quotations which I find significant. The first, from Prospectus report, is as follows: "Our findings indicate that extensive reforms are required that go beyond the structures in the health system." The second, from the Brennan report, states: "In our view, many of the problems are fundamentally structural. They relate to how the system is organised and managed." It is quite obvious that a solution lies, not in throwing more money at the health service, but in better management.We have tough decisions to make, so let us make them and move on. We all long for a time when we have a health service which serves the needs of all our citizens, when we will not see the necessity for people to knock on our doors to get a service which should be theirs of right. We are not achieving it under the present system, so let us do whatever is necessary, change what needs to be changed and get on with it. I fully realise that we will step on toes as we do that, but better to do so than to have people dying years before their time or having to spend lengthy periods on hospital trolleys while they wait for some necessary treatment. They are already contributing enough money to have the best; let us give it to them.Let us look at the manner of achieving the correct balance between medical and administrative staff. For instance, in the accident and emergence department of one Dublin hospital there had been a manager to co-ordinate everything on a particular shift. This was necessary and maximised resources and was appropriate. When another person was added to that shift, it was an assistant manager, not someone who would increase the level of care available. This is symptomatic of what is happening in many areas of the health service.Looking at the 25,000 jobs which were created led me to wonder where in the health service they had been provided. I got my answer on page 88 of the Brennan report, which states that management and administration staff increased by 26% over that period, while nursing staff increased by only 16% in the same period. This shows something is definitely wrong there.There is a certain analogy with the old problem in the Irish soccer team where the "suits" were better looked after than the players producing the results. I know there has been a big increase in other support staff, but I would have thought that the front-line staff, the people who actually do the caring and curing, would have had first priority on any increased resources.I am in full agreement with the close examination of the operation of the health boards as they have now been in place for 30 years. The Ireland in which they were set up was vastly different from the one with which they have to cope today and it is inevitable that changes and improvements could be made to better serve the people. They are only a minor part of the problem, but it is necessary to fully review their effectiveness.I recall reading some time ago about the setting up of the boards. At that stage they were seen as being undemocratic, in that a majority on the body which would oversee the administration of the system would not now rest with the elected representatives. This was a fundamental change from the old boards of health and county councils. We now are told that the new boards will not be in any way representative of the elected members and that system seems even more undemocratic. When all is said and done, it is the elected representatives who are ultimately answerable and the only ones who go in front of the people regularly.It is difficult to have faith in the present health boards when one looks at the recent proposal to extend the medical card system to all those over 70. It turned out that the numbers proposed were substantially incorrect, with many of the beneficiaries already dead. To use a non-medical phrase, the boards' finger is no longer on the pulse. A bigger scandal is in the drugs payment scheme, which since 1997 has gone up by 221%. This figure is ludicrous. While I agree wholeheartedly with the principle of both schemes, in regard to medicines we must make sure there is value for money.There has to be greater use of generic drugs, which at present make up just over 4% of the total. That is unacceptable. There are unhealthy pressures from drugs companies which must be tackled and doctors must be encouraged to prescribe more generic drugs as an alternative.It has puzzled me for some time how dentists and orthodontists can be employed totally within the public service giving service only within that framework, while other consultants can have both a public health role and a private practice. I have come across cases where consultants are manipulating the hours and services of registrars and house officers, sometimes moving them from hospital to hospital to look after their own private patients. This is totally unacceptable, but consultants appear to be uncontrollable at the moment. A new agreement requiring consultants to give a certain number of years exclusively in the treatment of patients in the public health service is long overdue and should be looked at as a matter of urgency.No Member of the Oireachtas from Waterford or the south-east could contribute to a debate on health without referring to the problem of cancer care and the provision of radiotherapy services in our region, and specifically Waterford city, which is the accepted central location for it. In my time in politics, I have never seen such a concentrated, sustained or committed campaign as for the provision of this service in Waterford. I am convinced that no matter how long the debate goes on, or how long people must wait for this vital service to be provided in our area, we will see people on the streets and in the media looking for it, and I will be supporting them. This is long past the stage where it is a political debate, if indeed it ever was. I regret that the indicators coming from the Minister are all negative in respect of the provision of this vital service in Waterford and while I accept that no decision has yet been made, or at least been made public, I do not like the signals.This is a service which will not cost the earth. We can see the parallels elsewhere and measure the cost from those. We are told that a relatively modest €20 million will solve the problem and give people this service which is their right. In the light of the enormous budget which I spoke about earlier, it is small change indeed.This is not some pie in the sky request, or one that could be termed luxurious. People are suffering as a result of their enforced trips to Dublin and not having such an inexpensive service available locally is imposing unnecessary hardships on patients and their families.I urge the Minister to take another long hard look at this matter, purely on practical and humanitarian grounds, and to give the south-east the service it deserves.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I welcome the Minister. Every time we have a debate on topics such as health or agriculture, it quickly deteriorates into a row between the various political parties on how they do their business, which does not help. Today's debate confirms my view that politicians and elected representatives have very little to offer the health service. That is not to say that they have nothing to offer, but they have no more to offer than ordinary members of the public. It is no argument to say that they represent the people. A populist approach will never run the health service properly. The more I hear political representatives of health boards arguing that they are the only people elected by the people, the more I take the view that they should have less of a role to play.While there is a strong case for elected representatives to determine national strategy, they should not be required to take decisions on the basis of one small area of a health board from where their votes come. That is absolutely negative and is not what we are trying to do. The health boards should definitely be focused on the needs of the consumer. I make a clear distinction here between the needs and the wants of the consumer.Everybody wants a hospital on every street corner and a full service general hospital within a taxi ride to their front door. Politicians are feeding such expectations. Every time there is a row on a health board, the politicians always take the populist view. People may say that it is easy for me to say this because I am not a member of a health board, but that is what I strongly believe. I am not saying there are not individual members of health boards who happen to be elected representatives and who may make huge contributions. However, they do not have to be elected representatives to make a contribution. Very often their sense of independence, integrity, clear judgment and focus might well be distorted and perverted by the fact that they have to represent people in a particular area. This should not be taken as any diminution of political representatives; people know my views on that. In this instance, however, it is not necessary.I would like politicians to ask how many hospitals we need in the country. How many more times do we have to hear the argument as to whether the hospital should be in Cavan or Monaghan? It is a serious issue when a health board cannot make up its mind on one hospital. It is not that the board cannot decide; it will not do so because there is political fallout from making such a decision. It has nothing to do with the health needs of Cavan and Monaghan, but is rather a case of who will be closer to the hospital.The same is true for all political parties. When I was first elected to the Seanad in 1987, I met the then former Labour Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, who was watching the row going on because the nasty Fianna Fáil Government decided to close Barrington's Hospital in Limerick. In the front row of those leading the march against its closure was the then leader of the party, the Progressive Democrats, which was going to impose cutbacks in every area, standing shoulder with the late Deputy, Jim Kemmy. Barry Desmond said that when he was Minister he had met a delegation from Limerick, which he had expected to make a huge plea to preserve Barrington's Hospital. However, he said he was wrong and that the delegation actually wanted a fourth hospital in Limerick. I believe that attitude still exists.In addition to the lack of economies of scale through the health boards, there has been no uniformity of approach. There has been no sense of a central policy administered regionally. I have frequently sought to ascertain policies on issues that ran across different health board areas and discovered that they did not exist. Child abuse is a current topic. I carried out an assessment of the health boards approximately four years ago and I could not find any two health boards with the same approach to dealing with victims of child abuse. Some health boards had no policy at all. That cannot be an effective and efficient way to work.I often compare this country with New Zealand, which is a post-colonial, ex-Westminster run country with a population of the same size, overshadowed by a huge neighbour – in our case, Great Britain and, in New Zealand's, Australia. It has the same issues, which in some cases are worse because it is a larger country geographically. New Zealand has taken some creative and attractive initiatives. To deal with the regional hospital issue, the authorities there designed a state-of-the-art mobile operating theatre, which can be moved between hospitals throughout the country. Via an airlock, this links in to a local regional hospital and allows a considerable number of operations to be carried out. Not everything can be done, including, for example, heart transplants. The consultants are brought from the main centres such as Christchurch and Auckland to perform the operations and the post-operative care can then be carried out in the regional hospital.I do not know whether this plan will work. However we will know when we see it in operation. If it works patients will not spend days on hospital trolleys, we will not have mile-long queues and things will be dealt with in an efficient way. However we will not be able to judge by asking people whether they are getting a good service. I do not believe people will ever say that they are getting a good service and we need more objective ways of measuring its impact.I agree with Senator Kenneally about investment since 1998. If I had been told then that the health budget would be increased by a factor of two and a half and increase the numbers working in the health service by an amount equal to our total number of civil servants, I would have thought all our problems would end. However, that has not been the case and it is irritating to hear a succession of Ministers and Government speakers say this; we all know it. They can either take credit for it or take the blame for not being able to make it work. However, it is not possible to have it both ways. It is not working and that may be because there is not enough money.More investment is required in the health service. As President of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions, I believe that we cannot have Texas taxes and Scandinavian standards of care. This has not worked anywhere and we will need to bite that bullet at some stage. The junior partners in Government might not be jumping up and down with enthusiasm on that issue, but that is the direction we must take.I do not know the answer to the questions posed about the consultants. I would be interested to hear the views of Senator Maurice Hayes on that because I know he has dealt with it, in some detail, in the North of Ireland. We must grasp the nettle of whether they should be confined to public work or should be allowed to also work with private patients. Professor Brennan makes one vital point above all others. If private people are using the public practice, they should pay for every penny of it, but that is not happening. The consultants have access to equipment bought by the taxpayer and this is not being paid for by private patients.I recently spent three hours talking to a man who bought an MRI scanner about six years ago when there was a mile-long queue at every hospital looking for them and there were none available in hospitals in rural areas. Although I do not have time to outline them, I am sure the Minister would find extraordinary the difficulties encountered by that man in providing MRI scans at two thirds of the price it was costing hospitals. The machine was installed in a clinic attached to St. James's Hospital, right in the middle of the Minister's health board area. He was obstructed every step of the way and not by the politicians. It was the consultants who refused to read the scans, who refused to co-operate, who refused to refer people.It was only a matter of time before large sporting organisations, large voluntary hospitals and hospitals down the country began to realise that they could send people to Dublin and get a quicker service at a given time rather than have people standing around all day in the waiting rooms of some of the hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area. These are issues that need to be examined.I do not have time to deal with the related issue of restrictive practices as regards pharmacies. The shortage of therapists is interesting. There is no reason a shortage of therapists cannot be dealt with within three years but it means the provision of training places. Members of the European Community have a commitment to the mutual recognition of qualifications of certain professions. That should be extended to therapists. People who have trained and qualified in the United Kingdom are either acceptable here or else they should have a top-up. Failing those two options, we should provide more training places. We should take a stand on these issues.There is a lot of work to be done in this area. I remind politicians on all sides that there is no political mileage in this issue. Whoever is in Government will have to deal with the same issue. I would love to see it being dealt with on an all-party basis. I agree with Members on this side of the House who have listed out the broken promises. There is no doubt that there were broken promises and I speak as a disinterested party.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I would rather he read this because he will not be able to take it all in today. If the Minister of State reads that report he will find that it deals with many of the issues that we have been concerned about, particularly the question of trying to square the circle between accessibility and excellence of treatment. I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I urge him to put his hand to the plough and to stick to the task. It is time to go ahead and make the change.The great tragedy is that the Fitzgerald report of 40 years ago was not implemented. If it had been, we might not now be dealing with many of these issues. The reports which have been put before the House deal with a range of issues but there is a danger that people believe managerial and administrative changes will be enough. At the end of the day, that may only be a rearrangement of the deckchairs on the  Titanic. We must enable very gifted, dedicated and able people in the medical, nursing and allied professions to treat patients. That must be the outcome. From the amount of money that has been put in over the last number of years which has not been matched by outcomes, it is quite clear that there must be change. It is important that attitudes are changed, not the labels over people's chairs nor the titles they have.Any service industry knows that the ones that succeed are customer-driven. They are cost effective and are capable of dealing with change and that must be the test. These are difficult, complex issues and difficult, complex sets of relationships. Overnight success and change cannot be expected. The person who has to make the difficult choice is the consultant sitting across the table from a patient. Where there is incessant demand and limited resources, there are difficult and tragic choices that have to be made. The object must be to engage the people who are making that commitment in the choice and in the discussion and that is the essence of the Brennan report. It is very important that it is handled sensitively.I would not agree with all the Brennan report conclusions and say that a patient must be either private or public. I believe there is room for people to have the option of saying they will buy in so many sessions. I believe that private medicine should be practised in a private hospital, not in a public hospital. It should be a fully-fledged and insured hospital that does not then depend on the public hospital as the safety net to pick up the bits.There is an over-concentration on the acute sector. The primary care sector is the key sector. That is where the resources and time should be invested. The shorthand should be how to keep people out of hospital when they do not need to be there.It will be shown in the Hanly report that hospital systems must be dealt with. I believe it takes about 0.5 million people to support a full system. There are enormous developments such as telemedicine. The important area for investment is the diagnostic infrastructure so that people are given the results of tests quickly. That could be done at a great distance. I have a vision of the service as a series of systems with diagnostic-related groupings in which the main hospital becomes the acute ward, the intensive care ward, and as much of diagnosis and after care as possible is decentralised. If that is done and accompanied by a decent ambulance service, people will find that they have a better service locally and their overall health will be better.The media and the health correspondents seem incapable of talking about a change without talking about downgrading. How is it downgrading to devote oneself to the care of elderly people? How is it downgrading to do something which is not actually the sexy end of acute medicine? What is required is a balance of services.I was attracted by Senator Fitzgerald's notion. I too believe a local political input is needed, not at the executive end but in some consultative way. It could be that the district councils could be consumer councils for all the public services, particularly for the health service.There is a suggestion in the report that consultants be made accountable. Of course people must be accountable but it is the manner in which it is expressed. These are very scarce commodities and very special people. If they do not get jobs in this country, the world is their oyster. Does talk of accountability mean they will be sacked or disciplined? That must be sensitively handled. I would rather see it done by involving ethics and other factors. There is a different calculus between the accountant and the manager and the consultant. We are thinking in terms of resources and they are thinking in terms of the care of patients. Somewhere, some place, a middle ground must be found.I commend the report and the courage of the Minister who is taking it on. I say "God help you" to the Minister for State but I advise him to keep at it.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I thank the House on the number of speakers who have contributed to the debate. The purpose of the reforms that have been announced is to put patients first and we should not lose sight of that. We are putting patients and the public at the centre of our health policies. My colleagues in the Department of Health and Children and I are determined to deliver real improvements in the health services, particularly in primary and community care services. This matter has been touched on and I will go into greater detail in that regard.Improvements will also be delivered in the hospitals system. We embarked on this process two years ago, when the reports were commissioned. We recognise the need for radical reform and we accept that many stakeholders and the general public will be involved in that reform. We are determined to press ahead with the reform as quickly as possible, to the benefit of the vast majority of the people. I am pleased and heartened by the positive comments I have heard in the House and I appreciate them greatly.The urgency of proceeding with implementation does not need to be underlined. It is clearly accepted and acknowledged that it is important that we move forward with this process rapidly. A public consultation process with all the stakeholders is under way. Perhaps Members of this House can help to fast-track the implementation process. I would welcome their assistance in that regard.Many Senators spoke about investment, both in terms of what has been achieved and what will be required. The level of investment in the health service will be in excess of €9.2 billion in 2003. Senator Kenneally referred to the fact that we spent just €3 billion on the health services five years ago. One can easily calculate that funding has increased threefold in a short number of years. The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I accept the clear need to match the level of investment with reform. We should continue to underline that there is no point in speaking of financial investment only, as we have to invest in the reform package too. I hope that reform will be accompanied by better accountability, better performance and much better management. Senators will agree that the people deserve nothing less from public representatives in terms of public services.A number of speakers highlighted aspects of service or the proposed reforms in their own areas of interest or in their own constituencies. I have asked the House to assist in the radical reform package because reform is for everybody. Reform will only work if everybody supports and is involved in it and embraces the change that is required if we are to focus our attention on improving service for patients and the public.I was interested to hear the remarks of Senator O'Toole, who followed two Senators who discussed parochial issues. I do not agree with all of the sentiments the Senator expressed about the role of public representatives on health boards. As somebody with quite a lengthy record on health boards, I have to say that excellent public representatives have made an extraordinarily positive contribution to delivering a service, and not necessarily on a parochial basis. I appreciate that certain public representatives are concerned about some of the structural changes. If we are all to sign into this reform, nobody can expect to be excused from the challenge of change. We should be big enough to participate in change in a proactive manner, if it is in the best interest of those we serve.I will try to respond to some of the many other issues that were raised. The hospital services executive will be accountable through a board structure directly to the Minister. The chief executive officer of the hospital services executive, who will be the accounting officer, will report to the Committee of Public Accounts in the normal fashion and will publish ordinary public accounts.A number of speakers suggested that the reform programme will somehow diminish primary care and community care services. The idea behind the reform package is to ensure the success of our health strategy document, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You. The section of the document which refers to a new direction in primary and community care focuses solely on the importance of such care. The reform structure that has been proposed allows the primary care model to develop and grow. We need to recognise as a priority the need to strengthen the identified primary care support services and to identify the different management demands of sectors such as technology, organisation and delivery on the ground.I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister's contribution earlier today specifically addressed the issue of community and primary care. I sense that some doubts may remain, however, which I am happy to clarify rather than allowing misunderstanding to exist. I am happy to clarify any aspects of the Minister's comments. I wish to contradict some of the comments that were made by Senators. We wish to develop primary care and to put in place appropriate support structures. I encourage Senators to examine some of the 11 primary care pilot schemes that were undertaken nationally, spread throughout all regions. This new dimension, which involves working with the important keyholders to deliver health services on a community care basis, is working well. I understand from my knowledge of a number of the pilot schemes that they are going extremely well.The development of the three pillars allows for primary care to grow and for existing community care structures to be strengthened. It will allow for more focus on the issues without having to compete with the constant over-emphasis on hospital services as the only part of the health system. We put undue pressure on this sector to deliver some aspects of community care services. Having said that, I acknowledge and recognise the great partnership between those who provide community care services and acute hospitals in the delivery of certain services. It would be wrong to extrapolate from what I have said that we are going to break up those partnerships. That will not be the case.The accusation was made that this reform is based on a top-down approach. The philosophy underlying the health service executive is not to impose a top-down approach but, rather, to ensure that when good ideas have been developed, the lines going both up and down through the system would be clearer and the decision-to-action chain shorter.This is not in any way, an attempt by me, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the other two Ministers of State at the Department or even the Department itself to stand back from the responsibility of good service delivery. Clarifying roles between the Department, the Ministers and the wider delivery system will allow us all to pay more attention to evaluating the impact of policy and investment in a much more focused way.The health information and quality authority to which the Minister referred will provide the authoritative voice in regard to information, communications and health technology assessment and the development of a framework of quality standards in every aspect of the health system. A system-wide approach is sadly lacking at present.Reference was made to the variation in service that is evident throughout the existing structures. This is why we want to ensure that we have a satisfactory system-wide approach, from Malin Head to Mizen Head, and that we will have equity of service to which everyone will have access.It is difficult to respond to all the specific points that were made in the short time that is available. I hope that I can address most of them. If I fail to do so, however, I invite Senators to contact my office or that of the Minister to ensure that they get all the information they require.A number of Senators raised the question of hospital services in connection with the Hanly report. I will not pre-empt what that report might contain. I am not in a position to do so, as many of the contributors to that report have not yet signed off on it, which is why it has not been published. Public representatives in the Lower House accused the Minister of deliberately withholding the Hanly report, which is nonsense. I am pleased to say that Senators have not made similar allegations. I hope that this House will have an opportunity to discuss that report when it becomes available.Senator Maurice Hayes touched on the importance of the delivery of the service at proper facilities and by appropriately qualified personnel. I speak for all my colleagues in the Department when I say that we do not wish to see the downgrading, closure or reduction of any aspect of the health service. We will endeavour to continue to ensure enhancement of the service provision in whatever are deemed the most appropriate structures to ensure that the best practice is offered in centres of excellence.

There are Members present whose political parties had an opportunity to do some of what we have done in a relatively short period, but they failed to do so.A number of speakers referred to primary care. Opposition parties when in Government had an opportunity to develop primary care facilities but did not do so. We have done it. We initiated a new direction in primary care. New supports have been put in place in regard to community structures. People harp on about the area of home help, but they do not refer to what we have done in other areas in terms of support structures.I had the honour and privilege of launching a scheme recently which replaces a previous one where assistance was provided for a short period only, which may not have been of much use. We have moved on to a patient-centred system. That is the approach both at community and hospital level. We want to ensure that wherever the service is delivered it will be patient-centred and seamless. We aim to respond appropriately and adequately to patient need.As Senator Maurice Hayes stated, there will be some tough and difficult decisions ahead. If, and when, we have to examine the appropriateness of a structure or a facility, I hope that all involved; stakeholders, public representatives, consumers and professionals will do so with a better understanding of the provision of our health service in its entirety.There has been enough nonsensical talk about hospital closures. It is not my desire, nor is it that of the Minister or the other Ministers of State, to see the closure of any facilities. We would like to think that in the future our time in the Department will be seen as a period of great enhancement of service delivery and of the facilities that enable that provision of service in each community.The Minister asked my colleagues and me to take note of the various matters that were raised with regard to the reform package. In the course of the next few days we will have a discussion on the suggestions and comments that were made in this House. One of the central issues in this regard is the role of the public representative and the possibility of there being a democratic deficit in the new structure. The Minister indicated that he will take on board the comments that were raised here today before he brings proposals back to Government on this issue.I was heartened to hear from a number of Senators of the need to ensure proper planning and delivery of services. The response to patients needs is a central theme of the health strategy to which I referred earlier and is what this reform programme is all about.In his concluding remarks, the Minister indicated his determination to move forward as quickly as possible with the implementation of the reform package. That is also my desire. We must commence the consultative process with the stakeholders as soon as possible. I encourage people who have contact with the stakeholders to participate in the consultative process so that we will be in a position to begin moving the process on by the autumn. The sooner we have a framework in place to mirror our requirements in the reform package, the sooner we will see the necessary improvement all of us wish to achieve with regard to service delivery.I have covered, in a global sense, the various comments by Senators. If there are any specific queries on the reform package, I would welcome being informed of such matters now, rather than in the autumn, when I would hope we will be in a position to progress the requirements rapidly. Those who may prefer to work directly with the Department should feel free to contact the Secretary General who will be very helpful in responding to any points of clarification which may be required.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I thank the Minister and the official from his Department, who remained in the House throughout the debate. We had an excellent debate from all sides of the House. Unfortunately, all who wished to speak did not get an opportunity to do so – the Whip has a list of those who still wished to speak. However, there is nothing we can do in that regard at this time but I hope there will be a further opportunity to engage in such a debate in the future.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Section 11 specifies the length of time ordinary members of the council shall serve. There is, however, no reference to the term of appointment of the chairperson. It was always the Minister's intention that the chairperson should serve for a term of five years. I propose the amendment to provide for this.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It is a reasonable amendment to provide for a period of five years. It is the same in most semi-State bodies. We agree with it.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I commend the work of the Minister and his officials on this legislation. I know it did not spend a lot of time in this House but it had a long period of consideration and had amendments made to it in the other House. I wish the Department and all the players connected with the arts industry every success in the future with the new framework outlined in the Bill. I hope it signals a continuation of the tremendous growth of the arts, particularly the arts in the community.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	117	We wish the Bill and everyone associated with the arts every success. We had hoped the Minister would look at a few areas of concern but because some of the amendments tabled in the other House were not accepted there was not any point tabling them again here.Perhaps when the special policy committees are established, they will look at the issue of professionalism. "Amateurism" seems to be a dirty word as far as the Arts Council is concerned. Many applications have been submitted but it is not within its remit to fund amateur societies. An international festival of light opera is held in Waterford, the organisers of which have applied on numerous occasions for funding. It has professional producers, adjudicators and orchestras but because amateur societies take part – it is the only amateur operatic festival in Europe – it cannot get funding.Amateur musical and operatic societies are the lifeblood of communities but cannot get money from the Arts Council. That is a disgrace. A musical society in Carrick-on-Suir has bought an old theatre and is looking for money from the Arts Council. Surely communities and associations involved in the community should be supported by the council. I ask the Minister to consider the issue of professionalism when the policy committees are being established. Amateur musical societies should be supported. The Association of Irish Musical Societies is the umbrella body for all amateur musical societies. It has not received any money from the Arts Council, which is a disgrace. Something similar is happening in the area of traditional music, which we discussed yesterday. I ask the Minister to take these points into consideration when the committees are being established.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I compliment the Minister, his officials and all involved in this process. Seldom have the arts been at the centre of a debate for so long. That must be healthy. Many were involved in the debate and, therefore, their expectations might be high. I empathise with the points made by Senator Cummins. We might have to revisit the definition of professional and amateur status not within the legislation but within arts policy. The emphasis should be on excellence rather than on who is or is not involved on a full-time basis. Perhaps it might be possible for the Minister to consider designating one of the special committees for that purpose because a committee only stays in existence for a certain length of time. Given that there are three committees on offer, it might be a good process and would give the people Senator Cummins mentioned an opportunity to be proactive in that regard.I wish the Bill and the incoming Arts Council well. As was said recently in relation to the Middle East, we should let bygones be bygones, put the debate behind us and get on with our work in a positive way, as is expected of us from all practitioners of the arts. Because of our status internationally, there is an onus on us to do our best in every way possible and be exemplary in the work we do. I thank and congratulate all involved.
#MichaelBrennan2	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and his officials. I agree with all of the previous speakers that this has been a very good debate and that the consultative process that has taken place has been worthwhile. The Minister has got it right this time. All those involved in the arts are asking for is a fair share. I am also delighted to see the Minister spelling out that the local authorities will have a role to play at local level – this is essential. I wish the Minister well.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	120	At the conclusion of the Seanad's consideration of this Bill, the Minister wants to express his sincerest thanks for the manner in which Senators from all sides of the House participated in the debate which was informed and sincere. The level of engagement demonstrated yet again just how important the arts were. Although concerns were expressed about elitism or perceptions of elitism, what came across to the Minister clearly during the debate was that the arts were already a part of the lives of people from all social groups and in all areas. Furthermore, it was confirmed to him that there was an unprecedented level of interest in participation in all sectors of the arts. If we provide facilities, they are used. People enthusiastically participate in arts related events without any effort on the part of officialdom to push them in that direction. The young, in particular, seem to find the arts almost their natural medium. It comes naturally to them to embrace the arts.The Minister said on Second Stage that snobbery should never dictate what we regarded as art or who should be involved in the arts. It is equally important that we avoid any reverse snobbery that would exclude or downgrade what have traditionally been seen as the less accessible artistic forms. Every art form has its place. The Minister believes that if people enjoy something, are challenged or stimulated by it or draw inspiration from it, that is of value. We are not in the business of excluding anyone – there is enough room at the table for all.We heard well thought out, measured and mostly constructive contributions on the issue of the traditional arts, for which the Minister is grateful. I emphasise again his main concerns with regard to this issue. He is a passionate supporter of the traditional arts and can readily understand and empathise with the sense of grievance evident in the sector. He believes decisive and effective action must be taken to respond to this. The fact that he departed from the original approach of the Bill in this context does not in any way imply that he disagreed with what the Bill was trying to do but simply that he believed that a different approach would yield a better result. He is convinced that the mechanism being provided for in the Bill can achieve what needs to be achieved and is determined that this will be followed through. It must be remembered also that the mechanisms now provided for in the Bill do not in any way restrict the Minister to having just one go at this. We can come back to it as many times as are necessary and work on it for as long as we need to make sure that real change happens.Soon, I am glad to say, we will have a new Arts Act, the first for many years, and shortly thereafter a new Arts Council. The Minister knows that the funding position this year has caused difficulties for many but we must remember that this is set against a background of unprecedented levels of funding over the past five years. He remains convinced that the arts are more vibrant, imaginative and alive than at any time in our history and that the sector has an extremely bright future.The Minister has taken on board comments in relation to the importance of representation on the Arts Council which is required to advise the Government as well as serve the interests of the arts community and the greater public. It is important, therefore, in fulfilling its remit that it has the necessary expertise and is not subjected to the constraints of having particular regional representation or representation of specific art forms.The Minister regards it as a great privilege to be entrusted with responsibility for the arts. I know he will employ all his abilities to nurture and advance this precious part of our lives. I will take note of Senator Cummins's comments and bring them to the Minister's attention with those of Senator Ó Murchú. On behalf of the Minister, I thank all participants in the debate and the officials of the House and the Minister's Department. I wish the Bill success.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I move:That Seanad Éireann:– considering that the Convention on the Future of Europe will shortly be finishing its work on the drafting of a new constitutional treaty for Europe;– noting that the published draft articles of this new constitutional treaty refer specifically to the creation of a common defence for the European Union which will be reflected in the new constitutional treaty;– acknowledging that unless Ireland engages in the debate on future EU security and defence, then the rules for any new arrangement will be made with regard to the concerns of other countries but not of Ireland;– recognising that Ireland should not only be a member of the emerging EU security and defence architecture but should be one of the architects helping to design the new arrangements, and– accepting that there is nothing inherently moral in Ireland assuming a neutral position on every issue, irrespective of the unique circumstances of each case,calls upon the Government to:– facilitate an open and honest debate on the future of Ireland's neutrality in the context of the emerging EU security and defence arrangements;– accept that currently the people of Ireland are the least protected citizens of any EU member state, and that they would derive considerable benefit from Ireland's participation in EU security and defence co-operation;– admit that unless the Government acts now, Ireland will face a "take it or leave it" situation with regard to the new security and defence arrangement which will have been devised by other member states, and on their terms, and– agree that by doing nothing the demise of Ireland's neutrality will come about on the least favourable terms for Ireland.The motion is an invitation for all of us to grow up politically and recognise that the new Ireland in the new Europe must play a leading role in the development of the European Union.We must accept the fact that neutrality, as we have known it, is no longer a necessary mark of Irish independence. Since the early decades of the 20th century, much of the philosophy behind Irish neutrality was based on a desire to mark our independence from Britain. This was both understandable and justifiable in the 1930s and 1940s, perhaps even in the 1950s, but it is absolutely unnecessary in Europe today where Ireland has truly come of age.The motion is about generating debate and I look forward to hearing what the other political parties have to say about it. Fine Gael is calling on Government and Opposition parties to open a mature, wide-ranging and honest debate on the future of neutrality in the context of a new and confident Ireland at the heart of a growing European Union. The old certainties no longer exist and what was appropriate for the emerging Republic of Ireland in the middle of the last century may not be the best way forward for our modern, confident state.Two of the so-called foundation stones of neutrality, its political and moral strengths, are no longer solid arguments in the quickly shifting sands of international politics. Even if our political neutrality did exist – it is difficult to argue that we were genuinely neutral during the Second World War – it was as much about being anti-British at worst or at best not wishing to line up on the same side as the British. We have moved on from that type of mentality and are in no way inferior to our neighbours in the United Kingdom. Through our membership of the single currency, we are playing a dynamic role in the European Union – perhaps a more significant role than Britain. We should, therefore, design our military and defence alliances, not on the basis of what Britain might do but on what we wish to do.The other so-called foundation block comprising the morality and righteousness of neutrality has never impressed me. One cannot preach at any great length from the high moral ground about the principles of a neutrality policy. As the motion states, there is nothing inherently moral about adopting a neutral stance on every issue, irrespective of the circumstances. There are too many international issues where countries, regions or ethnic minorities have come under threat for us as a country which emerged from generations of domination to shut our eyes to these difficulties and say we cannot do anything to help because we are neutral. This neutrality of high moral principles is more akin to moral cowardice.It is absolutely clear that, as a small country, we cannot resolve international or regional conflicts but as part of the fastest growing political union in the world, the European Union, we can certainly play a role and have a meaningful input to any defence decisions or initiatives taken by the Union. In the new millennium it is fundamentally untenable for us to be part of the European family, yet unwilling to defend and protect the institutions and ethos of that family. Virtually all the economic and social progress made in this country since 1973 has stemmed from the European Union and we have played a full role in those evolving European policies. We must now consider our responsibility in playing a part in the security of the European family.As the European Union expands under the enlargement process which the House has discussed on a number of occasions in recent months and as the new European treaty emerges, there will be much discussion about a common defence policy for the European Union. This will almost certainly be reflected to some degree in the treaty. Unless we are willing to engage in this debate and help set the ground rules for EU security and defence co-operation, we will have to accept that new arrangements will be made and that every country's concerns, except those of Ireland, will be taken into account. Will we, therefore, shout from the sidelines or become part of the team and help set the pace of change? Ireland must not only be a key player in the emerging jigsaw of European security and defence but we should also be part of the design team putting the plan in place.There are currently three choices facing us: first, we can remain as we are, in theory, militarily unaligned; second, we can become part of an EU common defence arrangement; or, third, we can branch out very far and decide to join NATO. We cannot sit back and do nothing, however, because if we do not contribute to the debate, we will be sidelined when the policy to be unveiled addresses the concerns of all European states, excluding Ireland's. Whether we like it, European defence co-operation is up for discussion and there is a clear momentum towards some type of common arrangement. It is up to us to get involved in the discussion now, otherwise a common European position will be adopted and we will be left to take it or leave it. A small number argue that we should remain on the sidelines but that type of cop-out policy will result in the end of our neutrality probably on the least favourable terms for Ireland and with the ground rules being written by others. We should not take that approach.In the aftermath of the recent war in Iraq, there has been much debate about the international military balance and the apparent desire of the United States, the only remaining world superpower, to become some sort of world policeman. On a number of occasions this House has debated the Iraqi crisis and the issues arising from it and, presumably, will continue to do so. One clear issue arising from that debate, however, was that the European Union was not united on Iraq and, when push came to shove, was in no position to offer any type of leadership. Had there been European unity on Iraq it may well have averted the crisis but instead we had the so-called old Europe versus new Europe internal debate. I suspect that in years to come other Iraqi-style situations will face the European Union but unless we can make genuine progress on building strong and unanimous European security and defence co-operation, it will be sidelined again. If we succeed in building such co-operation, however, it can provide a necessary political counterbalance to Washington, as well as playing a constructive role in conflict resolution and confidence building worldwide.Fine Gael is advocating an EU defence policy based on five key principles: first, any EU defence entity must adhere strongly to the fundamental principles of the United Nations; second, a commitment to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, and to a solemn undertaking by the European defence union, acting as a entity, not to use nuclear or biological weapons; third, a commitment to mutual defence and support among all EU member states based on the Article V protocol opt-in arrangements for states that do not want to make this an automatic provision – in effect, this would mean that Ireland would decide, on a case by case basis, whether to come to the defence of another member state if attacked and would not be automatically obliged to do so; fourth, a commitment, as a priority, to the provision of resources for peacekeeping and peace-making operations and to the Petersberg tasks; and, fifth, respect for the right of other member states to be involved in other military alliances, if they so wish.This proposal could win strong support across the European Union and would have a good prospect of being agreed and implemented. If we have no approach, we will, unfortunately, be confined to options promoted by others. Fine Gael believes putting the issues clearly before the people with a provision for biannual debates on European security and defence policies and related issues would best serve the interests of the people.It is time to stop making security and defence policy by stealth and, instead, do so in an open, constructive and integrated fashion. Fine Gael believes the first duty of the Government is to provide for the defence and security of people in Ireland and in Europe and we present these proposals as part of an honest attempt to put forward suggestions, which are derived from our consideration of what we believe to be the national interest. I hope the proposals will help to initiate an informed and rational debate on these crucial matters.I look forward to the response of the Minister of State and the contributions of other speakers. The sacred cow of neutrality has confined us very much in our thinking on European and international development for too long. We must move on and the motion is a balanced and careful step in the correct direction.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I second the motion. I thank Senator Bradford for putting the position, outlined by our party a month ago, in such a succinct way. I am glad that we are debating the issue because many colleagues have sought such a debate for a number of months and it is right and proper that it should take place.Seán Lemass was one of Ireland's greatest politicians. He emerged quickly from the independence movement as a modern, progressive leader who was prepared to change. Together with T. K. Whitaker, he fundamentally changed economic policy as Taoiseach and Minister for Finance. One of his abiding truisms from the 1950s was that if we are part of Europe, we must defend Europe.That is important, particularly for the Fianna Fáil party, which has a problem with neutrality historically. The party's problem is not based on policy in terms of the global sense of neutrality, but on the hangover from Ireland's antagonistic relationship with Britain, its nearest neighbour, during the earlier part of the last century. That is understandable because, following Independence, the relationship with Britain was difficult because of Northern Ireland. We have moved on from that because the Northern issue, constitutionally at least, has been resolved. Both sovereign peoples accept the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. The hangover from that relationship, as Senator Bradford stated, resonates with Fianna Fáil's position on neutrality. There are interesting signs of movements afoot within the party in this regard.Movement on neutrality will not come from Fianna Fáil because of the party's pragmatism and sense of doing the right thing for this generation by redefining what we mean when we say that we want to be part of a new European security and defence structure. Problems will be caused by the left because it has been utterly dishonest on the issue of neutrality. I refer to the recent debacle on the war on Iraq. If the European Council had taken a position on Iraq, through qualified majority voting or a simple majority, it would not have been agreed by Spain or Great Britain, although it would have been agreed by France, Germany and other countries that were hostile to the US action.The left in Ireland and in other European countries has traditionally failed to recognise that European security and defence policy will not be driven ultimately by US and British concerns. While that axis must be recognised, this policy must be driven by EU member states that have a different perspective on the world. The left in Ireland needs to grow up on this issue, as it has flouted reasoned argument for too long. Members of the social democratic party in Europe cannot understand the position taken by the left in Ireland on this matter. I refer, in particular, to the small parties such as the Green Party, the Socialist Party, Sinn Féin and others. They must confront this issue.As a small independent country within the Union, Ireland must adapt its distinctive contribution to world affairs since the foundation of the State to whatever new structure emerges as a result of European security and defence arrangements. It is inevitable in the next five years that a new structure will be put in place. Given the developments that took place following the Amsterdam and Maastricht treaties, together with the new arrangements that will emerge from the Convention on the Future of Europe, it is inevitable that Europe will build its own capacity for the international policeman status that, unfortunately, it has had to look to the US to provide during the past ten years.Yugoslavia is an obvious example. A total of 90% of the original S4 troops who were deployed there were American. Europe sat on the sidelines and looked on at the tragedy while 750,000 people were killed and 1.5 million displaced as a result of the activities of Serbian troops throughout Yugoslavia. Europe stood idly by and it is to our eternal shame that war occurred and this State and every other member state refused to take its responsibility seriously, thus, ensuring the US Government did so instead. As Europeans, we must confront this.There was also a ridiculous peacekeeping operation in Macedonia. Under the triple-lock arrangements, Ireland accepted such operations must have a UN mandate and be approved by the Government and the Oireachtas. As a result our troops could not be deployed in Macedonia because there was no formal UN resolution following difficulties with the Chinese in agreeing such a resolution. Ireland must get real on this issue. I have learned from my limited experience of foreign travel that Ireland is regarded as an honest broker and as a country that has deployed considerable numbers of troops at flashpoints throughout the world, such as the Congo and the Lebanon.Ireland is respected and we must keep this to the forefront of our minds when we debate the new European defence structure. That structure will not result in one state violently attacking another state, but it will take on the challenges of international terrorism. Europe is still exposed to that threat and, in that context, Ireland is particularly exposed because there are significant American interests here. We have no defence structure to address that threat should terrorists decide to attack those interests.The kernel of the document published by Deputy Gay Mitchell is that if a protocol is not negotiated now by Ireland on its own terms as a small, independent country within the Union, we will not be able to join in the future and that is why this debate is important. A significant number of people want to participate in the debate and they are prepared to define what it means and to work with our European partners in developing a structure for defence and foreign policy of which Europe can be proud.The motion will lead to a much needed debate in Ireland. A referendum will be required if change is desired, but I am confident that we would win it by including a provision that Ireland would not support a mutual defence clause. I look forward to the contributions of colleagues.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important issue and to reiterate some points I have already made in the House and at the forum on Europe. While I agree with aspects of what Senators have said, I cannot agree with all of it.I was interested to read the remarks of the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Kenny, at the Dublin Members forum on Beyond Neutrality in Dublin last night. Deputy Kenny said Fine Gael would not regret the end of Irish neutrality. He continued:For Fine Gael this entire issue is one of balancing rights with responsibilities. The Government's abject avoidance of responsibility and its absolute aversion to productive controversy means it is up to Fine Gael to refashion the political dynamic here.That is absolute nonsense. This Fianna Fáil Government has been hugely productive within the European Convention. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe, Deputy Roche, have worked tirelessly over the last couple of years. Deputy Roche has been universally praised for his innovative approach and the huge amount of policy papers he has submitted on the new treaty.Our Government's commitment to Irish neutrality was clear when it signed the Seville declaration in June 2002. Ireland would participate only in humanitarian and crisis management operations that are authorised by the United Nations, in accordance with Irish law and approved by Dáil Éireann. Anything else would require a constitutional referendum.The success of the European Union over the last number of decades has been hard and bravely won. Since its foundation the Union has been prepared to take brave steps into uncharted territory and it seems the current international order dictates that now is the time for the EU to take another brave step along this road of integration. Without doubt, a new international landscape is emerging at the beginning of the 21st century. A seismic shift in international relations caused by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War has led to a situation where the United States is now the sole superpower, with self confidence commensurate with that status. Russia is refashioning itself and redefining its global role and China's integration with the international economy has also been a powerful catalyst for change.The disintegration of the bi-polar environment into a multi-polar world has not led to the predicted happy-ever-after era. Rather it has opened a Pandora's box of potential territorialist disputes and border squabbles which continually challenge the competence of international organisations. Furthermore attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United States have served as a reminder that national and international security cannot be taken for granted, even by the world's most powerful superpower.With this in mind, it has gradually become apparent that the EU must begin to forge an appropriate common European security and defence policy in order to deal with the challenges of this new international environment. In all member states of the European Union, therefore, a discussion is under way on the development of this policy and on how national security policies can best meet the challenges of the changing European and global security environment. Ireland is no different and I am delighted to air my views in this regard.As a neutral member state Ireland can play a fundamental role in the forging of the EU's common foreign and security policy. However, we do not need to go down the Enda Kenny and Gay Mitchell road of cheap headlines and political opportunism. We can make a difference in a number of ways on our own. Now is an ideal time for the neutral and non-aligned states of the European Union to co-operate with one another and to attempt to collaborate on policies in this area of security and defence. We in Ireland must realise that this is not a 14 against one scenario since Sweden, Finland and Austria are our natural allies.Co-operation on security and defence related issues beween Finland and Sweden has certainly intensified over the last decade and they have been very successful in this regard. Their foreign and defence Ministers have published common articles containing policy initiatives and the countries have tried to co-ordinate their actions in the entire field of security. The importance of acting together has always been emphasised and in this way Finland and Sweden have been very successful in achieving their goals at a European level. Perhaps the most distinguished achievement – and Senator Bradford mentioned this – was the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the scope of the Amsterdam treaty. I am certain that Ireland can also be this pragmatic and can use such co-operation to our advantage.It has been argued that throughout our membership Ireland's role as an initiator within the EU has, at times, been weak. While I do not agree with this in the main, I believe it holds some validity when dealing with security issues. As an EU member state there has been a distinct impression of Ireland as a spectator of the common foreign and security policy rather than as a participant in the project of giving the EU a security and defence dimension. Ireland has not always shared the responsibility for developing it and, therefore, has found it difficult to make it work in a way which is consistent with both the EU's and Ireland's political goals and values.Ireland now has the opportunity to be more proactive in this area. We should attempt to customise the security policy of the Union rather than having to react to certain policies we see as threatening neutrality. Now is the time for Ireland to become much more assertive, to abandon traditional reservations and to demand policies that simultaneously meet our needs and the needs of the European security environment, bearing in mind our neutrality. Other neutrals have done this. The Finns have had considerable success in developing the EU's policy towards Russia. Ireland can enjoy the same level of success.We all share an interest in seeing Europe playing an active and principled role on the global stage. Although Ireland may have had a distinctive foreign policy approach in many areas, this does not prevent us from having a fundamental identity of interest with our European partners and it does not mean we can shirk our responsibilities in helping to frame this policy. Neutrality has always been a guiding principle of this State's foreign policy and can once again guide Ireland and the European Union as we go forward together. For this reason I am convinced that Ireland, as a neutral member state, has a pivotal role to play in the EU's common foreign and security policy.As the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe has just joined us, I pay tribute to his excellent work in his Department since he took office last year. He leaves Ireland in very good state as the work of the EU Convention comes to a close with the intergovernmental conference ahead. We can all go forward with confidence, knowing that our position is being represented by such a capable and talented Minister.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	124	There is little difference between what Members on all sides of House are saying on this subject. There is a difference in the Fine Gael position on neutrality at the end.This country has never been neutral. It may have been politically neutral but it has never been neutral. We should look closely at where we stand on issues. We should recognise the fact that there is a moral, military and political neutrality. Whereas we may not have been politically involved, it is not true to say we were ever neutral. Decent Irish people went to fight in the 15th international brigade, with the support of many of us who favour Irish neutrality, Mr. de Valera went to the German embassy to sign the book of condolences on the death of Hitler and access to the Shannon stopover was granted for planes going to Iraq. We have never been neutral, although we may not have been militarily involved.No one should be allowed to discuss neutrality until they have defined it. I have had great difficulty doing so myself and that is why I cannot come to a conclusion on the question. I do not know any neutral country. It is not true to say Sweden is a neutral country. It has sold arms to both sides of every war I can remember and has got fat on the proceeds. That is hardly neutrality. Switzerland is not a neutral country. It flogs and launders money from every corrupt regime in the world.Utterly unacceptable things are going on in the world at the moment. The first war against Iraq was properly decided upon by the United Nations but it was run by the United States. The war was not fought by a UN army. The current war against Iraq is absolutely illegal and we must say so.Having said that, we must look at what is happening in the world today. One of the issues that threatens my view on neutrality is what happened in Kosovo. I think of the European Union standing back while ordinary undefended people were being killed and brutalised and none of us did anything about it. In fairness to the United States, of which I am a constant critic, it did go in to try to protect the unprotected people of Kosovo.We must have a policy which allows us to take some action in such situations. What is even worse is that in recent times our so-called neutrality policy did not allow Irish forces to take part in peacekeeping duties in Macedonia, an issue raised previously by Senator Minihan. We must address these issues. Anyone discussing them, coming to a conclusion and defining a policy better have an answer to all of them. We hear about the views of the different political parties but I would like people to be brave enough to say what is a fair policy on neutrality, one which is morally and politically acceptable. However, no one has done this.I have said on many occasions on radio, television and in this House that we should be guided by the United Nations in which I believe firmly. However, I do not believe in the current UN system because it includes every corrupt regime in the world. They are all there, bar one or two. Who is to say the people concerned are more trustworthy than our colleagues in Europe? That is a question I want someone to answer. I do not trust NATO, the Western European Armaments Group nor those who have a vote within the United Nations. In its policy statement the United Nations is now handing over much of its responsibility to the regions. It is regionalising its approach as Kofi Annan has said time and again. What will our position be if the United Nations states, "Okay, as regards Europe, we want our affiliates from the continent of Europe to make those decisions?" What will we do in that case?I recognise that I have raised many issues and would be the first to admit that I do not know the answers. However, I know that our current policy is inadequate to deal with the issues occurring in the world today. I recognise that both the motion and the amendment call for a continuing debate on the issue of neutrality, which I support. I would like to hear people giving honest views on the matter.On the efforts of various Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring, in producing the last White Paper on foreign policy, made a serious attempt to discuss the issue of neutrality with a modern approach. The current Minister for Foreign Affairs has had a very thoughtful approach to the issue. He has made some thoughtful contributions on a number of occasions for which he did not get much publicity on what we mean by being neutral, what it means to us and where we stand.If we begin with the parable of the good Samaritan and who we walk past, is neutrality a state of passivity or an active state? Does neutrality mean that we can watch wrong being done and not take part? Does it mean that we have a moral responsibility to defend the weak? What does it mean in communist, socialist or Christian terms, or just plain common sense? Where do we find ourselves in defining neutrality? Where is our framework of reference? What objectives are we trying to achieve? How do we see ourselves contributing to the globe? This is the island of saints and scholars which sent people all over the world at various times in our history. How do we do it today? What is our motivation? What is the dynamism we create as a country and where does it lead us?There are huge issues and I do not know who we can trust. We must at some stage face the question. We can all sing the mantra: what happens if good people stay silent and do nothing, when they come for them, the others, and all the rest and there is nobody left to look after anybody? We have all been through it many times – we were neutral. We can be proudly neutral about the fact that while Hitler was exterminating millions in Europe and Pol Pot was exterminating millions in his country and so on, we were neutral. Where is the sense of national pride in this? What should we have done? I know that I am more comfortable celebrating the activities and contribution of the 15th International Brigade and its commitment to go to Spain to fight what it considered an evil and a wrong. I am more comfortable dealing with that issue than any other aspect of neutrality, which is important.How do we deal with wrong in the world? It comes down to the United Nations. If the United Nations includes groups we cannot accept such as decision-makers who do not give freedom and civil rights in their own country, we should not entrust to them our position on neutrality and our involvement in the globe? That is the question we must answer.

#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I support the amendment to the motion. Some fundamental and valid questions have been raised by Senator O'Toole. I do not claim to have the answers but would make one suggestion. Given the questions he raised, it appears that he has lost faith in the structures in place. I would be one of the first to concede that there are serious faults in them. During recent events in Iraq, when criticisms were thrown back and forth across the floor of the House, one of the strongest points I made was that if the United Nations was functioning to the highest level of efficiency, some of the problems about which we were concerned would not have arisen.Notwithstanding that fact, and acknowledging that within the United Nations, just as within the European Union, there are regimes whose behaviour in terms of armaments and dealings leave a lot to be desired, we must have some point of reference. The only point of reference for me, one to which the Government still adheres, is the United Nations, imperfect as it might be. Many of these imperfections have been acknowledged during the years by successive Governments. We would all like it to rapidly evolve to a state of far greater perfection and effectiveness in terms of monitoring world order, its mandate when established. If one was to use any yardstick as to its success to date, it must be that since World War II, we have not had a world war. I tend to use this as a valid yardstick when determining how effective or otherwise it has been in terms of world order. It is true that we have come to the brink on many occasions but, at the end of the day, since World War II, with the United Nations in place, there has been a tremendous degree of consultation and discussion between nations which has enabled the world to move forward without another world war.The strategy set out by Fine Gael is wrong, it is in a sense stating we should cast off neutrality. Notwithstanding my sympathy for some of Senator O'Toole's views when he posed the question as to what is neutrality and how we should define it, what is proposed in the motion, if one will excuse the pun, in a sense gives hostages to fortune. That is not what we should be doing in such a sensitive area. The proposal is seriously misguided and would prove extremely costly to the State at this time. The terms of the Government's amendment set down clearly Ireland's position on neutrality in the European Union, ambiguous as that might seem to be. It acknowledges the clear wishes of the people, as well as their clear understanding of the Government's position on the issue.Our military neutrality is always a popular subject for the media, a few of whose scribes may, like Fine Gael, according to its leader and its party spokesman, Deputy Mitchell, regard our neutrality as a sham. I want to inform Fine Gael that we do not regard our present position as a sham and the Irish people have endorsed our position in the referendum on the Nice treaty.Before I deal with some of the implications of the motion, I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the other delegates and alternates to the Convention on the Future of Europe, for their work and commitment leading up to the adoption of the draft constitutional treaty by the 105 members of the Convention on 13 June last. There is widespread agreement that in terms of the overall package Ireland did quite well. This is acknowledged even by the main Opposition parties. Credit must go to the Minister of State for the leadership he showed in Ireland's involvement in many of the amendments which were incorporated in the final draft.Equally I want to comment on the initiatives the Minister of State took in encouraging and promoting cohesion, if that word is allowed, among the smaller states, both members and applicants. The Minister of State's initiatives there played no small part in ensuring and maintaining a proper balance between the rights and concerns of the smaller states and the larger powers within the EU. That is an important testimony to the commitment he has given and the success of that commitment. I want to celebrate that this evening.Many points have been made by the Opposition in the motion before the House. Many ideas have been suggested and many imaginative and creative ways have been put forward as to how Ireland could adopt a new role in terms of security of the EU. I want to bring to the attention of the House some facts regarding developments which have taken place over the past 18 months during the discussions at the Convention and decisions which have been taken, not only in Parliament but indeed by the Irish people themselves.Discussions, for example, at the European Convention, as set out in the draft articles of the new EU treaty, mean that any proposals to change the current stance on the defence issue will continue to be for decision by the Heads of Government acting unanimously. Since the referendum on the Nice treaty in October 2002, the Constitution provides that Ireland may not join an EU common defence, and that, as a consequence, further amendment of the Constitution, ratified by the people in a referendum, would be necessary before it could do so. God knows we have had enough referenda in recent times, and enough confusion, controversy and divisiveness about referenda, without foisting another one on the people immediately, which is what we would have to do if we were to seek to participate in a leading way at EU level, without constitutional restriction.It is important that we do not go out to flatter or to deceive. If we did, against a background of the existing constitutional requirement, we would simply be deceiving. We would be giving the impression to our European partners that we, as a Government, had the mandate from the people to take a leading role in discussions on any structures. My view is that we, as a party or a Government, either decide to cast off neutrality and go out with an open agenda, which seems to be envisaged by the motion, or on the other hand seek to lead the discussions with the big powers in the EU. Either way there is quite a considerable element of naivety about it and I do not see the merits.We, on this side of the House, are not at all impressed by the approach taken by Fine Gael, which they have now adopted as party policy, to regard our neutrality as a sham. We have no problem in talking about neutrality. We have no problem in putting before the Irish people our views on neutrality and, as I said, that has been endorsed in the last referendum on the Nice treaty.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I am very grateful to Senator Fitzgerald for sharing his time. I must be at the transport committee in a few minutes and that is why I asked to speak at this point.I believe in neutrality. It is possible to give certain definitions of it – the refusal to commit in advance to any military political bloc – and we are right to maintain this.With regard to Shannon, as my colleague, Senator O'Toole, has just whispered in my ear, it is laughable in one sense to hear Fine Gael defending Shannon where they were against it and the Government doing the reverse. This is extraordinary.I am not sure that we are threatened. In the Fine Gael motion, they state that we are the least protected citizens. What are they protecting us from? I do not feel under any great threat. Pol Pot was raised. What precisely did we intend to do about Pol Pot? That situation was precipitated ultimately by our good friends, the Americans.My native land is being torn in flitters. Over 4 million people have died there. I am talking about where I was born, the Belgian Congo. It would not do any good for the Irish Army to declare war on Kabila or the rest of them. What we could do, and what we have not done, is intervene through the European Union to target those Belgian, French and British companies which are involved in a criminal exploitation of that land, and that would help to stop it.Therefore I am not in favour of any great war, but I want the opportunity to say this. We have been told lies and more lies, and at least this debate will flush out into the open what people mean by neutrality. For example, we were told repeatedly during the Nice, Amsterdam and Maastrict debates that signing these treaties would not compromise neutrality. This was the policy of every Government involved, yet now they are reversing their view and stating that there is nothing left of our neutrality, it is a charade and we have already given it away by signing these instrument. That is what some of us were saying at the time, that it was the incremental giving away of our neutrality. Governments consistently told us this was not the case and now they are coming round and stating that there is no neutrality left because we gave it away. I ask them to stop promising us referenda—

I look forward to further discussions on this question of neutrality, but there is not much point in our getting involved.I would like to see the United Nations supported. What worries and concerns me is that the draining away of energy and resources and military capacity from the United Nations into these private armies, like the new European army, will destroy the United Nations. I put that in the context of the wonderful programme broadcast by RTE last night on the late Seán Lester, who was so instrumental in the League of Nations and managed to hang on in Geneva until the end of the war. They did manage to continue certain ideas and paved the way for the United Nations, but what happened to the League of Nations, and the way in which it was weakened, could very easily happened again to the United Nations, particularly because the malign intent of countries like the United States of America. It is up to all the small nations to band together to prevent that happening.I understand exactly what Senator O'Toole is saying when he talks about the huge range of countries involved, some of which are very repressive. The United Nations is an imperfect institution, but it is all we have and it is a hell of a lot better than the multinationals and the gangsters of European capitalism. I would put my trust in the United Nations before any European Rapid Reaction Force which might be walked into what a French Prime Minister, with disarming and uncharacteristic honesty, called the resource wars of the next century. Why should Irish people be killed in such wars, fighting for multinational corporations? I certainly will oppose that as long as I am in this House.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	131	It is useful that we are having the debate. It is something that we have been skirting around for many years. Fine Gael has done us some service in being perhaps more honest than they or others have been in the past in saying bluntly that they are in favour of ditching neutrality or what we have come to think of as neutrality. For the life of me, I do not really see any huge difference between the view being put forward in the Fianna Fáil amendment and that put forward in the Fine Gael motion. Both of them are effectively saying the same thing. The difference is purely in terms of language. Fianna Fáil still genuflects in the direction of neutrality and Fine Gael says it is no longer in favour of it, but in fact the ultimate position in which both parties find themselves is more or less the same.I must be straight-up about this and say that my own party is not a million miles away from that thinking either. There are some in my party who would not like to hear me say that, but it is the truth. Let me state the official line before I go any further. It is true that the party continues to support neutrality. As the Minister knows, we were party to discussions prior to the second referendum on the Nice treaty, which agreed the wording that effectively placed a constitutional bar on joining a mutual defence pact or any military alliance. We were happy with that. I endorse the notion that the people should decide whether we should ultimately take that extra step to commit ourselves to membership of an alliance, which would require us to automatically come to the defence of a partner state in the European Union which was the subject of aggression. Perhaps the debate we are having this evening will foreshadow a bigger one to come.Senator O'Toole asked what is neutrality. I agree with him that we have not been neutral for many years. The only time when it could truly be said that we were neutral was during the Second World War. Like others, with the benefit of 60 years' hindsight, I see very little of which to be proud in not having participated in the fight against fascism then. It may be a bit rich to criticise those who made a decision that appeared to them to be right at the time, but it is difficult for those of our generation to be proud of that decision from the perspective of moral or political principle.What does neutrality mean now? If we are to judge from the events of the past three or four months, it basically means that we are pro-American, that we are on the Atlanticist side of the argument, that with a nod and wink we will give logistical support to international adventurism on the part of the United States and that, if needs be, we will go along with the creation of a European foreign defence policy in coming years. There is clearly an argument in Europe between those who hold the views and values of "old Europe" and those who hold views and values of the "new Europe", as characterised by the US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. In my opinion, we are on the wrong side of that argument.The argument in this regard would have been greatly advanced if we had not been on the United Nations Security Council up to December of last year. It would have been interesting to see what role the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, would have taken in that context. Would we have taken the view of countries such as Chile and Mexico which let the United States know that, while they remain its friends, they did not support its adventurism? I do not believe we would have done so and certainly not as vocally as they did. I suspect that we would not have done so privately either. We might have put in very clear perspective for ourselves precisely what Irish neutrality means. It is quite clear what it means to the Pentagon; we were, and are probably still, considered to be a tacit member of the coalition of the willing. The US clearly saw us as being on its side and no doubt had some reason for thinking that. It is not difficult for us to use our imagination to work out why that is the case.Where do we go from here? The fundamental problem with our neutrality is that it is not underpinned in any serious way with a political set of values. In past decades, those of us on the left looked to underpin it in that way. However, we were out of synch with the vast majority of Irish people. We saw ourselves as being genuinely politically neutral between the Eastern Bloc and the United States. In truth, most Irish people did not see us that way, nor did the two biggest parties represented in this House.Even that perspective had to change after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Most social democratic and socialist parties in Europe have had to seriously reconsider their approach to foreign policy and also to security and military policy. Most of us have, or are about to, come around to the view that we need to be part of some sort of security arrangement in Europe, which, at the very minimum, makes it possible to ensure that the horrors of Kosovo, Srebrenica, Gorazde, etc., do not recur on the mainland of Europe.We should acknowledge that the drift is clearly in that direction and that the debate should take place. There are certain aspects about which we must be clear. It would not be possible for those of us on the left to accept that a European security policy would be underpinned by a nuclear deterrent. We could not accept that it would effectively be the European arm of NATO. We would require that any European foreign and defence policy should, in effect, be a counterweight to what is decided by the State Department or the Pentagon in Washington and not merely a reflection on the European continent of that policy. None of those things is currently happening.At the start of this debate, Senator Brian Hayes said that, had there been a qualified majority vote on the European policy on Iraq, it would have come down on the French and German side. That is not clear at all and is certainly not clear in the context of a 25-member European Union. In that context, it would probably come down on the other side. Before we go down that road, we want the political values defined. We want to know in advance that Europe will act as a counterweight, reflecting our own democratic values and history, and will not be an offshoot of the Pentagon.This debate is rendered somewhat unreal by our unwillingness to grasp the aspect of military capacity, which does not seem to have occurred to us. We are not in a position to do anything and are of no use to anybody. While the House or any other forum can debate as much as they like whether we should be part of some aggressive action that might take place anywhere in the world, we do not have the military capacity to do so in any event. If we were to apply to join NATO tomorrow, it would not want us. We would be told to invest in our Defence Forces and our military capacity and come back in ten or 15 years' time.Even in the current context, we should debate whether we need to invest more in the Defence Forces. We should do so with a clear decision in advance as to where we are going. In a sense, we must decide what is our niche and what we are good at. We will never be able to provide thousands of troops and significant amounts of armaments with a view to engaging in offensive or even defensive combat anywhere. The evidence suggests that we have the sort of good interpersonal skills that are required for peacekeeping and peace enforcement. I am not the first person to say this and I believe it forms part of the White Paper on Defence. If we are to go down the road of mutual defence and greater engagement with this issue, we must invest further in a capacity that will allow us to do what we seem to be good at, namely, peacekeeping and peace enforcement.I am happy with the Petersberg Tasks as currently defined. I know there is some debate about expanding them with which I would not have any great difficulty. However, we should bed down the Petersberg Tasks and the Rapid Reaction Force and see how it goes. It is premature to talk about several stages beyond that as does Fine Gael. We need to be able to crawl before we can even aspire to walk.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister of State. I congratulate him on his recent work in representing this country proudly on the European stage.I support the call for a broad debate on neutrality. However, that is not the debate we are having tonight, which merely questions whether we should be militarily aligned. I agree with Senator O'Toole that this country is not, and never has been, neutral. "Neutrality" is probably the second most abused word – the most abused word is "republicanism". People have all sorts of definitions of those words. It is defined by the international community as "a non-participation in armed conflicts among states". That legal definition is based on the 1907 Hague Convention. In reality, the legal definition of neutrality is totally different to having a policy of neutrality. The legal definition lays down the international law, whereas policy is something that a Government can adopt. Even though a legal definition exists, it does not apply under UN sanctions or UN actions where the international community decides to take action against states. It would be difficult to get a group of people to agree what exactly they mean by neutrality.Our neutrality has served us well. Previous speakers highlighted the reasons for our neutral position as a result of the Second World War and the decision we took then. People have differing opinions as to why that arose, but there was an historical reason.Some say that we have opted out of our international obligations, but that is not the case. We have a proud tradition of playing our part on the international stage, from our missionaries to our NGOs and peacekeepers. As a former peacekeeper, I can say that our neutral status is something that was welcomed by the host countries which invited us in. Ireland was always the country they wanted. We are good at peacekeeping because of our traditional, non-aligned military role. We have a humanitarian role to play, but that does not mean that we should not face up to our international responsibilities and those we must face in Europe. We should participate in negotiations with regard to EU defence, but we should do so in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Government is proceeding in that way. We must have a say and face up to responsibilities. We can do so by committing forces deal with humanitarian needs, crisis management and peacekeeping.The triple-lock mechanism is an issue which I have highlighted in the House previously, particularly with regard to the situation in Macedonia, to which, under UN Resolution 1371, it was decided to send a UN mission. The resolution was vetoed in the Security Council by China and, as a result of our triple-lock mechanism, we were ineligible to participate in the EU-sponsored mission. That is a difficulty and I ask the Government to table an amendment to the Defence Act to correct that situation. By bringing forward the triple-lock mechanism, the Irish people did not for one moment intend that Irish troops could not participate in a humanitarian mission because China, for some reason of vested interest, decided to exercise its veto at the Security Council.I support the Government amendment to the motion. It clearly states the views of the 1937 Constitution, of recent referenda and of the recent EU treaties such as Maastrict, Amsterdam and Nice. It does not mean that I do not support a healthy and informed debate on neutrality. We must shake this monkey off our back. We must introduce a clear definition and perhaps we need an Irish interpretation of neutrality. However, we need something that we can put before the international community and say that we will play our part in international affairs.We have played our part very effectively, unlike some of the superpowers. I cite the example of Beirut in 1983 when Irish troops were serving in Lebanon. We were there from 1978, but in 1983 the multinational force comprised of the British, Americans, Italians and French decided to come in and do it their way. In May 1984, 241 US marines were killed and they withdrew from Beirut. The UN decided to return and the Irish were the first to do so. We worked under the UN, which is the way we do our business, and we stayed there until we proudly brought peace to Lebanon. The Irish paid with their lives. We have nothing of which to be ashamed in terms of the position we adopt or in our interpretation of neutrality. We play our part and we should continue to do so. I acknowledge that there is plenty of room for debate on this issue.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House. He is a forward thinker and I hope he will give a positive response to the Fine Gael motion. Fianna Fáil has not lost its hypocrisy when it has people such as Senators MacSharry and Fitzgerald among its ranks. They are still referring to the image of the maidens and the crossroads, as portrayed by de Valera in bygone days. I hope that there are other members of the party who will move the European initiative forward.I welcome and support the drafting of a new constitutional treaty for Europe, a process which is now reaching a conclusion. The issue that we are discussing this evening is the creation of a common defence for the European Union. It is imperative that we recognise that Ireland should not only be part of the security and defence structure, but should be actively involved in its construction. Unless the Government is 100% committed to positive action in this regard, Ireland will be left in a no-choice situation, whereby we will be forced to either tag along with decisions made by other member states or be left in isolation. At present, our citizens are the least protected of any country within the Union and clinging to our neutrality on every issue, regardless of the circumstances, is tantamount to political suicide. Constitutionally and legally, Irish neutrality is one of Ireland's best known myths. It has, perhaps, been taken out of the realm of legend by common usage, but, nonetheless, it has absolutely no firm basis in reality.As indicated by the Government's stance in respect of US aircraft refuelling at Shannon during the recent conflict in Iraq, semantics appeared to play a large, if suspect, part in its interpretation of the word "neutrality". One could argue that the Government reinvented the word to suit its own ends. It is not a word or concept that allows for expansion or contraction at will.We should move forward and end the farce of our "convenience store" brand of neutrality, which is cheap – as words are – available when needed and without much substance. It has served us well in the past, but it is time to move forward and align ourselves with the EU for mutual defence. In that way, the decision will be ours and the demise of our neutrality will be of our design and will not be forced on us in unfavourable terms. Therein lies the crux of the matter; we have a choice, but it must be a real choice. We will not be forced to abandon our neutral status but if we choose to remain militarily unaligned, we will be forced to accept the consequences.The draft constitution represents the outcome of 16 months of intensive work and negotiation between the EU institutions, national governments and parliaments. It particularly focuses on important protections for smaller member states. Articles 40.3, 40.6 and 40.7 indicate that Ireland will have to increase its defence spending considerably and could join a common defence without a referendum. Within the context of this country, neutrality has no legal or constitutional basis. We may not be a neutral country in the strictest sense of the word, but we are certainly a non-aligned one.No attempt has been made in the history of the State to define and rationalise the concept of our neutrality. It has been associated with a number of perceived values, such as an absolute vision of sovereignty, anti-Britishness linked to the original line of partition, anti-imperialism and nuclear fears. We must consider the circumstances under which we would be willing to advance beyond our own perceived neutrality to take part in a European Union defence entity.Ireland is not immune to terrorist attacks and there is no logical reason to suppose terrorist groups will not strike here. It is time to look forward, not only to our own defence but also to the defence of Europe as a whole. Our goal should be to assist and to be assisted within the European Union, which is on the brink of setting up a mutual defence arrangement which Ireland should join and help to shape its structure. No EU member state has the financial or military resources to resist the threat of global terrorism alone, as Senator Bradford said. Any common defence policy should adhere to UN principles, commit to nuclear and biological disarmament, mutual defence and support, the provision of peacekeeping and peacemaking operations and respect the right of member states to be involved in other military alliances.The European Union is taking responsibility for peacekeeping in Bosnia from NATO next year. It will be the most ambitious crisis management operation ever undertaken by the Union. For the first time it will apply a full spectrum of resources in support of peaceful transformation, development assistance, trade, institution building and support for the administration of justice and peacekeeping. This is a positive step towards a cohesive European policy on peacekeeping, defence and security.Faced with the Government's policy of inaction, Fine Gael has adopted a position on the issue of defence. It is looking ahead for our citizens, whose ultimate protection is our concern. The Government may choose to adopt a "head in the sand" approach to this matter, as it has on many issues, particularly since last year's election. It is important that this House should have this debate as Ireland approaches its Presidency of the European Union. We must take an active role in important decisions on defence and security. I hope the Minister of State who has demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to other issues such as the Treaty of Nice will see merit in Fine Gael's motion.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the subject of neutrality and, more generally, Ireland's involvement in security and defence policy issues. The Government welcomes a transparent and open debate in this area, not least in view of issues brought to the fore by the Convention on the Future of Europe. I welcome the contribution to the debate on neutrality made by the Fine Gael policy document as it is time we had an open and transparent debate on the subject. The debate should be well-bedded and removed from hysteria. Fine Gael's recent policy document, Beyond Neutrality, represents a thoughtful contribution to the discussion on Ireland's involvement in the development of EU security and defence policy. It contains some clear points of difference from the Government approach to this area, on which I will elaborate later, but is very welcome nonetheless.I imagine that there is a national consensus in relation to most of the five principles identified in the document. I am in full agreement with the first principle enunciated in it, that of adherence to the fundamental principles of the United Nations Security Council. Ireland's commitment to collective security has traditionally been pursued and will continue to be pursued through the United Nations. Ireland has traditionally been a believer in the concept of collective security and regards the United Nations as the centre of the system of collective security. It attaches particular importance to the role of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. I agree with Senators who have pointed out that the council is far from perfect. Senator Minihan has made the point that China has recently made extraordinary use of its veto and in the process placed an imposition on Ireland's participation in peacekeeping operations, in another part of Europe, which are supported by the United Nations. This illustrates one of the problems of putting one's eggs in the same basket, in effect.The Government is fully committed to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament, also mentioned in the Fine Gael document. I imagine that there is widespread public support for this long-standing objective which has been pursued by successive Governments. I expect that there is also widespread support for the document's reiteration of a commitment to peacekeeping and the Petersberg tasks, as well as respect for the right of other member states to join NATO. We could all adhere to such principles.Contrary to Fine Gael's assertion, the Government has been highly conscious of the changing security environment at European and global level and the new challenges arising. It has not shied away from debate on these matters in the Oireachtas or elsewhere and looks forward to further discussions.The document also contains an exhortation that Ireland should not only be a member of the emerging EU security and defence architecture but that it should also be one of the architects helping to design the new arrangements. My response to this observation is to state that we have been a part of the design team. Ireland's contribution to the architecture of European security and defence policy has been significant, as our EU partners can testify. The policy is not a new idea, as it appeared in its first inception in the late 1990s. Ireland has sought to play an active role in shaping and developing the policy. Ireland has had some success in its efforts to promote a balanced development between the civilian and military dimensions of the policy. It has also sought to prioritise the Union's approach to conflict prevention, an area to which the Government will continue to attach particular importance in the lead-up to and during its EU Presidency in the first six months of 2004.The Government's approach to this area has been informed by its opinion that military neutrality, on its own, is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security. Ireland should be engaged as a member of the international community. Senator O'Toole has pointed out that it is hard to define how anybody can be genuinely neutral. I have said in this House that nobody could be neutral in the face of what happened at Srebrenica. How could one possibly stand back and allow it to happen? The fact that it took place was one of the great shames of Europe at the end of the 20th century. Ireland, notably through the United Nations but increasingly through regional organisations such as the European Union, has sought to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace. The major parties have contributed to the evolution of this role which certain people in this country wish to continuously misrepresent.EU Heads of State and Government welcomed the recommendations submitted by Mr. Javier Solana for an overall EU strategy in the field of foreign and security policy at the European Council in Thessaloníki last week. I commend Mr. Solana's document to the House as a thoughtful review of how the European Union should progress in this area. It clearly states the Union should face up to its responsibilities in guaranteeing a secure Europe and better world. Ireland should and will contribute vigorously to the pursuit of the report's objectives. It is interesting that two speakers from other parties in the other House today deliberately tried to misrepresent the contents of the report, which is not an honest way to approach the debate. As I have said, it is one of the most thoughtful documents on security and defence, as well as Europe's moral responsibilities, that one could read. We will have an opportunity to discuss it in detail on another day.A central aspect of the Fine Gael motion, dealing with the security and defence proposals considered at the Convention on the Future of Europe, misses the point. I do not accept the motion's contention that unless the Government acts now, Ireland will be faced with a "take it or leave it" choice with regard to the arrangements. This argument overstates the reality to a substantial extent. The Government's position has been clearly stated in this as in every area of the Convention. It has been reflected in the proposed amendments to the treaty articles, which I brought forward on behalf of the Government.A key issue is the approaches that will be taken on mutual defence and the question of an eventual EU common defence. It is clear that this is potentially a highly controversial area. The Fine Gael document identifies important questions in relation to any such arrangement; namely, the automaticity of any such commitment and the extent to which individual members of a mutual defence commitment retain discretion over their participation. This aspect of the document is interesting. There is, for example, a difference in this regard between the mutual defence commitments contained in the Western European Union and NATO treaties, with the latter allowing greater discretion to the participants.Let us be absolutely clear about the existing treaty provisions. There is already provision in the existing treaty for a possible European Union common defence. However, a decision for a common defence would be a matter for the European Council, acting unanimously, and for member states, acting in accordance with their constitutional requirements. This is a point which we made on many occasions during the negotiations for the Nice treaty. In that regard, I was distressed by the rather unusual logic that was applied by Senator Norris in his colourful but inaccurate contribution. The possibility of a common defence has been agreed on three successive occasions, in the ratification by the Irish people of the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties, but the arrangements are clearly circumscribed, as I have indicated.In respect of common defence, the draft treaty articles propose that this should be a more explicit objective of the envisaged common foreign and defence policy. However, the important safeguards are retained. What is also explicit is that a decision to move at some stage in the future to a common defence would still continue to be a matter for the European Council, acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. I emphasise that point because I do not want this debate to be misrepresented to suggest that we are somehow abandoning protections. I reiterate that, in accordance with the amendment to the Constitution, approved by the people in a referendum in October of last year, Ireland cannot adopt a common defence where that common defence would include the State.The Convention also proposed closer co-operation on mutual defence, which would effectively amount to an interim mutual defence arrangement. It is clearly stated that this would be both optional and on an interim basis – this point is missed in the Fine Gael paper – pending a decision at some stage in the future to establish a common defence. The intention is that participants would be listed in an annexe to the constitutional treaty. The proposal to include a defence arrangement of this kind within the Union, but only for those member states who wish to participate, is clearly not the same as establishing a full EU common defence.This proposal has provoked a substantial amount of opposition within the Convention. Reservations have been expressed, not only by neutral and non-aligned countries, including Ireland, but also by some EU partners which see their security and defence requirements being best and most satisfactorily met through their membership of NATO. However, a decision to move at some stage in the future to a common defence would still continue to be a matter for the European Council, acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements.Ireland's position is well protected. Should the existing provision on common defence be amended or added to in any way, the Government would obviously have to take this into account in framing the proposal it puts to the people, in line with the substance and spirit of the recent constitutional amendment. As of now, I do not know whether the current treaty negotiations will give rise to a proposal for an EU mutual defence arrangement, either full or partial. I suspect that this will be one of the most contentious areas in the Intergovernmental Conference. If they do, however, we will have to discuss the issue. The Government will come forward with its ideas and the thinking of the Fine Gael Party will offer a useful contribution to the debate.I conclude by again stating the Government's firm view that, against the background of the developments outlined, Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains viable in the context of the new security challenges the world faces. Ireland's policy of military neutrality, embodied by non-membership of military alliances, remains fully relevant in circumstances where the emerging challenges have moved from traditional defence towards crisis management.Senator Minihan made the point that our policy of military neutrality has given us a particular status. It is a respected position and we should think long and hard before trading it away. In saying this, I am not in any way diminishing the attempt by the Fine Gael Party to provoke an open debate, which, as I said, I welcome.If I may, I would like to make one or two comments about some of the contributions. I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is difficult to achieve absolute neutrality in a literal sense. We live in a complex world where the fact that we get on with our business means that compromises are inevitable. He made a somewhat slighting reference to Mr. de Valera visiting the German legation at the end of the Second World War. That was, in fact, a gesture of neutrality. Over the years, it has been perversely misrepresented by people who should, and do, know better. If we wanted to be truly neutral, in the absolutist sense he was discussing, we would have to try and be blind on issues.The Senator also stated that we should be guided by the United Nations, but he went on to point out that there are problems with that organisation. He is correct in that regard. However, neutrality, as we have defined it, is a practical place to be. We have served the world better by being a small, neutral, non-aligned state and by not having a commitment to any of the military adventures entered into by the Western European Union, NATO or any other military alliance. We have put ourselves in a better position to serve the world in a way in which Irish citizens' want us to serve it. The Solana document refers to an entirely new approach to creating a world of peace and harmony. I contend that we may be better placed to serve that objective from our position of traditional military neutrality.Senator Norris put a most interesting spin on the question of neutrality. One could say he was in a right Joycean twist before he ended. While I commend his colourful language, his contribution was less than accurate.I do not understand the point Senator McDowell tried to make. If he wishes to honestly and objectively appraise the record of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, while he was on the Security Council – a record which was very well recognised – he will admit that the Minister played an incredibly important role in framing an UN resolution that was infinitely more successful than the position in which we found ourselves earlier this year.Ireland's neutrality, as has been said, is important. It is not alone important to us, but it is also important in terms of our role in the world. It may well be that the concept of neutrality has served its purpose, but I do not agree with that assessment. It is something of which we should be proud. In saying that, I do not wish to denigrate anyone who takes a different view. I have discussed the matter with Deputy John Bruton, in particular, who is behind the genesis of the Fine Gael paper. I fully respect and understand the objective in terms of contributing to a real debate on neutrality. Perhaps it is a good idea that we should have such a debate. However, I commend the Government amendment to the motion to the House.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. The Convention on the Future of Europe is an extremely complex undertaking. The main issues in the constitutional treaty will be defence and the section dealing with the social economy, as opposed to a neo-liberal model masked under proposals for labour market flexibilities. The Government, in the Intergovernmental Conference, may well roll back on some of the gains that have been made in that respect and this is an issue on which we should concentrate.There is value in debating what we mean by neutrality, but this is not the way to go about it. Our position on neutrality is well known and well respected throughout the European Union. I cannot see any reason that we should give it away now. There has not been any request or demand that we do so. The question should be asked as to why we might want to give it away. In my view, it is preferable to maintain our positive neutrality, much in the spirit of Connolly and of others down through the years who made the case against war and militarism and that is more necessary now than it ever was in the past.Construing security in terms of military strength is dangerously narrow. Eliminating poverty, exclusion and gross inequalities is the most positive version of security. Contributing to the idea of a new cold war helps militarism and also deflects from the task of eliminating poverty and development. Last year, the US defence budget was $396.1 billion. For $28 billion, one could provide basis primary education for every child on the planet. For the same amount, one could supply clean drinking water for everyone on the planet.The European Union spends seven times more than the United States on development aid. Is it now suggested that it should go down the same road and suffer the same consequences? Also, should Ireland's neutrality be dragged down the same path, suffering the consequences experienced by the United States? Retaining neutrality does not exclude Ireland from any decisions of the European Union on a common policy position or in relation to security and defence. Those of us in favour of positive neutrality do not advocate any strategy of avoidance as regards taking a position on the great issues of the day – far from it. It encourages us to take a moral position, the war in Iraq being a good example of a situation in which the Seanad can discuss and contrast views and ideas as between political parties.We can support a call for an open, transparent and accountable debate but will not contribute to the creation of a culture of fear or the bringing into existence of notional enemies. For example, some would argue that we could welcome dialogue with Islam. It is untrue to say we are presented with a take it or leave it situation. Ultimately, it is the people who will decide on a new constitution and the Intergovernmental Conference process will determine what is put to them. The problem is not Irish neutrality: the issue is to define it and spell out, courageously, a clear and accountable foreign policy which will take many interests into account but it must be a morally based policy which does not place economic interests above all other interests.This motion distracts from the real issues. Undoubtedly, it is helpful in calling for a debate but it seeks to have that debate structured on a very narrow basis. It also misses some of the more fundamental points on which we will be called upon to make decisions. Having regard to issues of aid, trade, debt and world poverty, there is a disgraceful distortion of world resources into armaments at a time when over two billion people living on this planet survive on less than two dollars per day and over one billion people live on less than one dollar a day. It is on such issues that people will judge political parties in terms of where they stand.I know this issue is extremely complex. In recent months it has been a great thorn in the philosophies of many individual politicians and some of the more traditional political parties in this country.

On my reading of the text of the Convention, it is very satisfactory from Ireland's point of view and takes account of our interests. However, we have to await developments in the Intergovernmental Conference.Perhaps the Fine Gael Party is asking us to endorse its recent policy document. It should be complimented on producing a thoughtful policy document, although I do not agree with it. The case is not made, it goes beyond what is necessary and, in some respects, is based on false premises, some of which are laid out in the motion before the House.There are frequent calls for a debate on neutrality, although there are few subjects which have been more thoroughly debated over the past 20 years, not only in relation to European treaties but also events such as Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. The subject has been very thoroughly discussed. I am not a fundamentalist on neutrality. I do not favour the type of position which would isolate us from all our friends on both sides of the Atlantic and make it impossible for us to be full members of the European Union.There is agreement by all parties in the House that, in this area as in others, we wish to play our full part. However, as I see it, the difference is that we, on this side, wish to build on a tradition of neutrality, of which we are proud. I sometimes get the impression from some Fine Gael speakers that they are not particularly proud of that tradition. Senator Bannon spoke of the demise of neutrality and alignment in a mutual defence pact. I am not at all sure that any full blown proposal for a mutual defence pact will materialise – it has been predicted for 20 years and has not happened. There are other reasons, apart from our concerns, for that being the case. The analysis is wrong in suggesting there is more pressure to achieve a mutual defence position, for which only certain member states are pressing.The notion that we are the least protected citizens in the European Union is, frankly, rubbish. Some of our protection is based on geography while some comes from our politics and diplomacy. I do not accept that we are more vulnerable to attack – even terrorist attack – than most other European states. If anything, the opposite is true. I approve of what the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, has been doing in the field of defence, using assets to update equipment for peacekeeping and so on. I do not accept that we need to increase our defence expenditure, in absolute terms, when we have so many other pressing needs.As the Minister of State has pointed out, we have been involved in shaping EU policy for over 20 years, as we continue to do today. The emphasis on Petersberg tasks, humanitarian tasks, peacekeeping, a limited element of peace enforcement and use of all the instruments of policy – economic and so on – is very much in line with our philosophy, of which we should be proud. The notion that we are, somehow, isolated and that others want to move in a different direction completely misreads the picture. On a political point, any party with which Fine Gael would wish to be in government does not seem to take this line. Nevertheless, I welcome this debate.We need to take what is positive in this country's tradition and build on it. There is no absolute neutrality. However, it does not follow that if we are not perfectly neutral, we are not neutral at all – that is a fallacy. Neutrality is not necessarily the same in any two countries. Swiss neutrality is not the same as Finnish neutrality which, in turn, differs from Swedish neutrality, either historically or in present day terms. There are different forms. One could become too legalistic about this. We should be proud of our neutral tradition, bring it into the debate on European common security and foreign policy and help in shaping values in that regard. We should not decide, at this point, that we have to abandon that tradition and just get into bed, uncritically, with other countries which have very different traditions.

I compliment Fine Gael on tabling this motion for debate, which I regard as politically very courageous on its part. Some might regard it as foolhardy but that is not how I see it. This is an issue which, in the long term, will ultimately impact on the lives of our people, particularly the younger generation. I would greatly prefer to have it discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas than in some small, unrepresentative, unelected, undemocratic, clandestine world body, where the big boys meet in secret and play with our lives, without any mandate from the people of the countries whose lives are at stake. I need not go any further in that regard – people are aware that such bodies exist. It greatly worries me that they are able to exist without any censure from people in general or even the media, although in recent times a censure is beginning to develop with regard to such assemblies and gatherings. Accordingly, this debate should be particularly open.It might appear a rather hackneyed dictum to speak in terms of the pen and the sword. In fairness, equating the sword with military capacity, our sword is very short and not very sharp. Equating the pen with moral influence, we are very strong. In that context, we can make a far greater impact.I recall the Falklands war and the independent stance taken by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. Given the clamour that ensued for 48 hours afterwards, we expected the world to fall on top of Ireland and that we would be severely punished for not taking a stand with Britain and its allies in the Falklands war. I regarded the stand taken by the then Taoiseach – I said it at the time in my oration at the Liam Lynch commemoration in Fermoy – as one of the greatest indications of our sovereignty for more than 50 years.I know what people will say if we discuss this issue because I recall canvassing during the Nice referendum and talking to young mothers and members of Fianna Fáil and other parties who said that they did not want to commit the lives of their sons and daughters if we decided to give up our neutrality. Nothing has changed since then. The Iraqi war, which was illegal, immoral and unjust, has created an atmosphere that will not enable neutrality to be diluted. It is an insult to the intelligence of the people to suggest that they do not know what is neutrality. They know in their hearts what is neutrality. It is not being anti-British or selfish; it is a stand which represents independence and sovereignty and which is based on justice. While I welcome the debate, I hope our neutrality will not be sidelined, either through confusing the issue or otherwise.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this enlightening debate. It seems that neutrality is back on track again. Our neutrality was shown to be non-existent during the recent Iraqi war. That is probably the reason we are here tonight contributing to this debate.Deputy Gay Mitchell must be complimented on his forward thinking. He took a political risk. I recall my first radio interview following my election to the House. I was asked by the allegedly non-biased radio interviewer what it was like to be elected to the Seanad as a member of an unpopular party. I said that 500,000 people had voted for the party in the general election and that it took political risks and unpopular decisions. Perhaps that is to the party's detriment, but times are changing. Fine Gael looks ahead because it is proactive. It does not run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. It took serious decisions in the past which cost people their political careers. I do not make any apologies for this document. It shows forward thinking and illustrates the fact that the party is not afraid to take political risks. Deputy Gay Mitchell must be commended in that regard.We, as a party, do not take an à la carte view of the European Union and its decisions. We have been instrumental in terms of our input at European level on many issues, including security, justice, humanitarian, economic and social issues. We have always been proactive. As a member of the Christian Democrats in Europe, we have been extremely forward in our thinking. However, the landscape has changed in Europe and throughout the world.We are often told by educationalists that we should act locally and think globally. Neutrality served its purpose when we were a self-determined nation and we looked inward. However, we now look outward because we are part of Europe. We must forget the scaremongering and the spin. The spin which will be put on this argument by those on the left is that Fine Gael wants a federal state and that we are sending our sons and daughters to be killed in the trenches. However, we are not interested in spin. This is about a constitutional treaty, not about forming a federal Europe. We are talking about mutual, not military, alliances to safeguard our citizens and to help the countries or citizens which are in danger from dictators.This debate is about the concerns of EU citizens and the building and maintenance of trust. Enhanced co-operation is the core objective in terms of protecting EU citizens. This debate allows us to put forward our views and our policies. However, we have not written in stone what might happen four or five years from now. Neutrality does not exist and it did not exist during the US involvement in the Iraqi war. We talked about looking for a UN mandate, not a mandate from the US. However, that did not happen. We allowed Shannon to be used as a stopover, therefore, we are not neutral. The UN, which is the watchdog of military alliances, is involved in this policy.I welcome the Minister of State's comments which suggested he was looking at the bigger picture. There will always be disagreements over policies put forward by parties because people will not be happy with certain aspects of them. I congratulate the Minister of State for acknowledging the role played by Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Gay Mitchell in European affairs. This debate is not over.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate. I am proud that Fine Gael has led this debate, which is long overdue.When I was young, I believed in Ireland's neutrality. I believed that my father, my brother, my boyfriend and subsequently my sons should not go to war because I did not want to lose them. I was selfish about it, as were many other women. We are protective of our sons, husbands and brothers. However, I saw what happened in the Balkans when mothers and fathers lost their sons and daughters in acts of genocide. We sat on our comfortable seats and said it was terrible. We wanted to know why someone would not try to sort it out. I watched as we allowed American aeroplanes loaded with troops and arms to land at Shannon on their way to an illegal war in Iraq, which was started because that country apparently had weapons of mass destruction. We know now and knew then that it did not have weapons of mass destruction. They were never found, yet the Government allowed the war to happen.Where is our neutrality? What is it? It is not what I thought it was. I have grown up. I am not prepared to stand by and watch others suffer any longer. I do not want to watch my neighbours suffer while I sit in my comfortable chair and hope somebody will do something about it. That is totally selfish.Ireland has grown up. It can stand up with the best of them in Europe but we cannot stand side by side with our neighbours when they are in trouble. There is a move in Europe to do something about this and we must be part of it. We cannot step aside and give all sorts of reasons for being neutral. We have heard several Members on the other side of the House, not just today, saying we are not neutral. It is a black and white issue. A country is either neutral or it is not.

It is like asking somebody whether he or she is a virgin. One must be one or the other. That is the way neutrality must be dealt with. This country must wake up and deal with it. I believe in the principles of the United Nations – that must be foremost. We must continue doing as we are in terms of peacekeeping and humanitarian work and in the Petersberg tasks. It is good, however, to open up a debate such as this. The people need to discuss this. They need to hear the debate and be involved in it and we must hear their decision. It is time Ireland took its place in Europe, stood by its neighbours and stopped sitting on the fence.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I suppose it would be wrong for youngish bachelors in the House to respond to Senator Terry's question about virginity.I thank everybody who has contributed to this very interesting debate. On all sides of the House there was an acknowledgement that in bringing forward this motion for discussion the Fine Gael Party was being courageous. More importantly, however, we are doing a public service because the issue of Irish neutrality in the context of a changing Europe needs to be addressed in a serious fashion. If we were here until Christmas or Christmas twelve months, we would not reach a conclusion on the question of what is Irish neutrality. We heard a dictionary definition from Senator Minihan and were then offered variations of that theme. Senator Mansergh has made the point that our neutrality is something that can be defined and of which we should be justifiably proud. Senator O'Toole asked what Irish neutrality was and whether it existed – unfortunately, I cannot answer that question to any substantive degree.I must remark on the very positive contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the Government's amendment, which acknowledges the possibility of "a decision to move at some stage in the future to a common defence", which "would still continue to be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously". These are the politics of the situation. What it means is that we will have to face this issue in the not too distant future. With this motion, the Fine Gael Party is trying to force the pace and put the matter under discussion. By asking hard questions within the House we are trying to persuade the public to answer them. Can we be a full part of the new, expanded European Union if we are not prepared to play a role in the defence of that Union, its politics and ethos? That is the fundamental issue to be addressed.We have discussed tonight and on many previous occasions our superb historical record in relation to peacekeeping and what somebody else described as a limited degree of peace enforcement. That stands as something of which we can be proud. However, we must recognise that the world is changing. We must recognise the need for Europe to speak as strongly as possible with one voice. Some spoke about the debates we had on Iraq. One of the big issues during that debate was that Europe was not standing together and could not speak with one voice. Until there is the possibility of a common European defence policy, we will not be speaking with that one voice. We must play a key role in the creation of that policy.Our neutrality has perhaps served us well during the years, whether it was political or military neutrality. However, we are now in a different era. This is a mature, confident, outgoing country which does not play second fiddle to anybody. We should not be prisoners of our past. In deciding to move ahead and take a different road we are not in any way condemning those who have gone before us. It is simply a recognition that things have changed, that the European Union is expanding, that we want to play a full, key role in the new Europe and that participating in the area of defence is an integral part of being a full team player. The people will respond to this challenge if we show the necessary political leadership.If the man from Mars mentioned earlier came to the House tonight and read our motion and the Government's amendment to it, he would have to read them again before he would see any substantial difference between the two. There is recognition across a broad political spectrum – Senator McDowell's contribution shows that it is not a simple right-left divide – that in changing times, changing politics and a changing world, we must look at things anew. The Fine Gael motion is promoting and encouraging debate and asking all of us to face the new reality and recognise that new policies will have to be designed for the security and defence of a new Europe. Ireland cannot sit on the sidelines. It must be a full part of the team.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing this important matter for discussion on the Adjournment. In the early hours of 25 May 1991, Sinn Féin councillor, Eddie Fullerton, was gunned down at the bedroom door of his house in Buncrana, County Donegal. Reports at the time stated that three men had been involved in the murder, that they had been collected by boat and had escaped across the River Foyle and that a burned out car was left in their wake. The UFF claimed responsibility and said that Councillor Fullerton was gunned down in retaliation for the killing of a Protestant man, Ian Sproule, in Castlederg almost six weeks previously.For 12 years the perpetrators of the crime have remained at large. However, on Sunday last, 22 June, journalist Frank Connolly revealed sensational evidence in Ireland on Sunday which throws the case wide open and which makes it imperative that a new investigation must be established. The new evidence points the finger in the direction of British intelligence involvement in the murder of Councillor Fullerton and the possibility that the Garda Síochána colluded in the occurrence, certainly from the point of view of not carrying out a proper investigation.The new information comes by way of a detailed statement, which, I understand, has been or is about to be given to the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by a reputable individual from Derry. This individual witnessed certain activities in the hours immediately after the murder. The new witness says he was afraid to come forward until now because, naturally, he was concerned that he might also become a target for assassination. The witness is adamant that he saw an unmarked RUC Sierra vehicle pick up the killers at a remote location in County Derry, within a half an hour of the shooting and after they had burned the car used in the killing. The gang of three was taken in an RUC vehicle to Derry, through a permanent British army checkpoint.Within hours of the killing, the witness told RUC officers and a Garda superintendent that he had seen three men in khaki clothes and hoods close to where the burned out car was found. However, he was never asked to make a signed statement and has never been approached since then by either the RUC or the Garda Síochána about the killing.The one interview he had with police was when he was visited by two RUC officers who came to his home and introduced him to a Garda superintendent sitting in the back of an RUC patrol car. He described the clothing of those he believed to be the killers, one of whom had fair hair and was in his late 20s or early 30s. The witness's description of the three men matched that given to the Garda Síochána by a Buncrana family who were held hostage in their home near Mr. Fullerton's house and whose car was used by the gang in the attack.The Fullerton family has repeatedly criticised the Garda inquiry. Their house was isolated by gardaí for 48 hours, yet key evidence, including hair apparently from the killers, was not retrieved. The dead councillor's personal ledger, containing confidential notes and diary entries, was never returned to his family and there is other disquieting evidence which time does not permit me to explore here.It is known that the killers came from, and escaped back, North of the border. Some 12 years have elapsed and nobody has been charged with, let alone convicted of, the murder of Councillor Fullerton.A witness has now come forward who is reputedly reliable and prepared to put his heretofore uninvestigated and substantial evidence before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The evidence points clearly in the direction of involvement by the notorious force research unit, an MI5 dirty tricks unit, which operated on both sides of the Border and, in this particular case – I say so advisedly – with Garda collusion from the point of view of lack of investigation.What is patently obvious is that the Garda investigation has not yielded up the killers and will not do so at this stage. Neither will the RUC investigation do so, if any is carried out. There is a clear obligation on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to institute an entirely new inquiry, given the failure of the Garda and the RUC to solve this murder.Due to the international nature of the crime, given its cross-Border dimension, this inquiry should be headed by a reputable person from outside either existing police force. I would support an inquiry headed by somebody of the integrity, status and independence of Mr. John Stalker. This is something that the Minister must do.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	152	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter and for providing me with an opportunity to address it.Let me state, unequivocally, my abhorrence at the heinous murder of Mr. Eddie Fullerton, who was at the time a Sinn Féin councillor on Donegal County Council, in the early hours of the morning of 25 May 1991. The attack was brutal and also involved the taking hostage of a family in Buncrana. Unfortunately, to date, no person has been made amenable for this dreadful crime, but the file remains open.As I am sure Senators are aware, responsibility for the murder was claimed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, which said that Councillor Fullerton was killed because he had passed information to the IRA. The subsequent Garda investigation indicated that there was no evidence to substantiate this claim, not that this is in any way relevant to what was, after all, a cold-blooded murder.I am aware of the report in the newspaper in question on Sunday, 22 June 2003, to which Senator Higgins referred. However, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have to say that nothing in the article indicates to me that a separate inquiry into the allegations would be an appropriate or commensurate response.The unfortunate reality is that accusations and allegations can easily be made, particularly from behind the cloak of anonymity, and the connections that are attempting to be made between the murder and the subject matter of the Morris tribunal are, at best, somewhat tenuous. The anonymous person to which the newspaper journalist spoke, dubbed "the witness", apparently on reflection, concluded that the men he had seen outside his home had been involved in the killing.In any event, I understand from the newspaper article that the person in question reported the matter to the appropriate authorities, and I have no reason to doubt that the information provided was taken into account in the subsequent investigations. I am not aware of any credible grounds to suggest that the Garda Síochána failed, in any way, to properly handle its investigation.I do not consider that the information in the newspaper report provides a reasonable basis for believing that the matter comes within the natural domain of the Morris tribunal, which has, as its principal focus, matters arising from Garda actions connected with the McBrearty case and surrounding events.The evidence is that Councillor Fullerton's murder was the work of loyalist terrorists, who claimed responsibility in the aftermath. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to bring what, on the evidence, appears to be an entirely separate matter within the remit of the Morris tribunal. Should any person consider that they have information of material relevance to the investigation of the murder of Councillor Fullerton, I would call upon them now, as a matter of urgency, to contact the Garda Síochána and to allow the appropriate authorities to progress matters.I note from the newspaper article that there is some intention to submit what is described as a "detailed statement" by the anonymous person to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While any such written communication will be received by the Minister, both he and I are firmly of the view that the appropriate authority to investigate criminal activity of this kind is the Garda Síochána. It is to that authority that any such written communication will be transmitted.As already stated, the investigation file in the case remains open and, hopefully, the opportunity will arise at some stage to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Will the Minister of the State give an assurance the matter will be investigated if the new independent witnesses come forward and Mr. Greg O'Neill, the solicitor acting on behalf of the Fullerton family, presents the file containing the evidence to his Department? Does he accept the Garda is not the appropriate authority to investigate this matter, given that 12 years has elapsed and there is a cross-Border dimension to the case involving both the Garda and the RUC, which calls for an independent inquiry? Will the Minister of State give an assurance, which I seek advisedly, that the investigation will be carried out by an authority independent of the police forces in both jurisdictions because both have manifestly failed to deliver the people who perpetrated this horrendous crime?

With regard to the other matters he raised, I will pass on his comments to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, we remain convinced the Garda is the proper authority to investigate a case of this nature and new information will be fully investigated and pursued.The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 June 2003.
