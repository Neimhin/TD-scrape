These payments are typically made in emergency situations to people who are struggling financially. It is clear that processing times have reduced and I imagine they have reduced significantly which is welcome and important. Will the Minister please provide an update on processing times at the moment?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The community welfare service is committed to providing a quality service to all citizens, ensuring applications are processed and decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. The purpose of an additional needs payment is to assist with essential once-off expenditure which people could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. In 2022 97,224 additional needs payments were issued at a total value of more than €58 million. The increase in the number of additional needs payments follows an extensive communications campaign designed to increase the awareness of its availability to support people. In recent weeks, the number of additional needs payments issued by the Department has returned to levels seen pre-pandemic. This is likely to be influenced in part by the issuing of eight lump sum payments, designed to assist with the cost of living, totalling more than €1.2 billion. Additional needs payment applications are varied and often quite complex, reflecting the individual circumstances being experienced. They cover a range of needs from supporting payment of a utility bill which might not be due for a number of weeks; to providing assistance with funeral expenses; to providing immediate support to help a family buy groceries. Where it is clear that a person has an urgent or immediate need, every effort will be made to ensure the claim is processed on the same day. Community welfare officers, CWOs, are experienced and can generally assess when a case is so urgent that it requires an immediate response. Approximately 10% of community welfare payments to customers across the country are made on this basis, which shows how responsive the service is to an urgent customer need. There are no backlogs at present for less urgent claims and work on-hand is within the scheme's normal processing levels. Complete applications are finalised within two weeks and less than two weeks' work is currently on hand.

In September I received a reply to a parliamentary question stating that 95% of applications were taking between five and eight weeks to be processed. I appreciate CWOs are stepping in where they can and where the person in need can access them in the first place, which has become more difficult. I would argue that few additional needs payments are less urgent as they are payments for an emergency, typically for a one-off need, especially in recent months with the way energy prices and bills have increased. It is important we keep a close eye on the continued processing of additional needs payments, particularly as we are seeing surveys and reports, such as the one issued by Barnardos yesterday, showing growing food poverty which should be a matter of concern for everyone in this House. Clearly, the budget, lump-sum payments and so forth are not enough for many families. We saw that in the survey yesterday. I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on processing. Will she also give an update on putting the payment online?

We absolutely value them and the delivery of this service is a priority for me and for my Department. I want to ensure people can get support when they are in need. That is why we had the major communications campaign to raise awareness of the availability of the additional needs payment. In 2022 97,000 applications were made. A freephone service is available for people who cannot make it to the office. There are a number of different ways in which people can apply for the payment. They can do so online, as I said, a national freephone contact line is available, they can go the Intreo offices which are open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week, and in exceptional circumstances, if people need someone to call to their houses, it can be arranged. The CWO will call out to see them. My Department is working on an online additional needs application process via the mywelfare.ie system.  The provision of the additional needs payment online application will ensure that those who wish to access the scheme online, including providing supporting documentation, will be able to do so. It is expected the online option will be up and running by the end of quarter 1. I am aware the Deputy raised this matter with me previously and I have followed up on it.

One of the issues the Minister and others have raised, as most Deputies on this side of the House will acknowledge, is that where people make applications and submit supporting documentation that is either not good enough or is needed again, it has delayed their receipt of payments. I acknowledge that. I hope that with the online system, all supporting documentation will have to be uploaded and people will not be able to submit applications until that is done. That is welcome. It is highly unlikely that everyone on this side of the House who has raised significant issues about accessing CWOs is wrong. I do not think we are. The Minister said she values CWOs. Will she tell us whether she has engaged with them since the rise in additional needs payments? What I and others in opposition are hearing on the ground about accessing them contradicts what the Minister has been saying. Has the Minister engaged with them, given how much she values them? I acknowledge that she does.

There are currently 412 people across all grades in the community welfare service. In light of the increased level of applications and as part of the budget, we have secured agreement for approximately 74 additional staff to be assigned to the community welfare service. Recruitment has commenced for these additional staff and it is anticipated they will be in place in the coming weeks, by the end of quarter 1 of 2023. In the interim, until those staff have been recruited, 30 social welfare inspectors have been temporarily reassigned to the community welfare service to assist with claims-processing since the beginning of November. There are no backlogs at the moment. We have managed to clear them. A lot of work went into it. There was an increase in the number of applications as a result of our extensive promotional campaign telling people this support is available. We have managed to reduce the waiting times significantly and applications are being processed. In cases where there are delays, it is generally because some of the information has not been provided. We give people time to provide the information in a humane way. Sometimes they simply cannot get the information or they do not understand it is required.

For this reason, the annual carer's support grant, which is paid in respect of each care recipient, is not means-tested and is not taxable. The grant is currently paid at a rate of €1,850 per year, which is the highest rate at which it has been paid since it was first introduced in 1999.As part of budget 2023, I announced a range of measures directly benefiting family carers, particularly in light of the current cost-of-living crisis.  In addition, in response to carer organisations and the voices of family carers, significant changes were made to the carer's allowance means test in recent years, notably as part of budget 2022. The capital and savings disregard for the carer's allowance means assessment was increased from €20,000 to €50,000, aligning it with that which applies for disability allowance. The weekly income disregard was increased from €332.50 to €350 for a single person and from €665 to €750 for carers with a spouse or partner. As a result, following these changes, carer's allowance disregards are the highest income disregards in the entire social welfare system, with the result that a two-person household, such as that referenced in the Deputy's question, can now earn about €39,000 per annum without their carer's payment being affected. While I understand the Deputy's concern, I also have to have regard to the needs of other welfare recipients and how best we can allocate our resources given competing demands. I have, therefore, committed to a carrying out broad review of means testing this year which will include, but not be limited to, carer's allowance means test provisions.

I welcome the fact the Minister will carry out a review. I take her at her word in that regard. I acknowledge the fact the Government has increased the income disregard from €665 to €750 for a couple. The scenario I am talking about involves a couple where there were two parents, one of whom is working while the second forgoes a career to care for a son or daughter and also forgoes a lot of opportunities, and does so absolutely willingly. The person then finds that because they are locked out of the system and because of an increase in income due to overtime, all other benefits accruing to the family are lost. It is those small exceptions in schemes that we are speaking to here. A small number of couples throughout the country are affected by this. It is to be hoped they will be included in any review that the Minister undertakes.

I know the case he has raised with me, and I understand the point he is making. From a social protection perspective, income is income and means tests are based on income. As I said, we are going to do a review of all the means tests because some, in terms of capital, are around €20,000, a figure that has not been changed in a long time. I expect to be in a position to increase that because €20,000 would buy one a car years ago but would not buy much now. That is the reality of the world we live in. I am happy to look at that. One of my priorities since I became Minister for Social Protection is to do whatever I can to support our carers because we all know the huge work they do and the contribution they make to our society. In my first budget, I increased the carer's support grant. In budget 2022, I was the first Minister in 14 years to make changes to the carer's means test. This year, I ensured carers got the special €500 carers support grant before Christmas. They also got double payments in October and before Christmas.

The scenario I am talking about is where a spouse has to work all of the hours God gives them to bring income into a family while their spouse is caring for a person, but all of a sudden the income is gone. It puts tremendous pressure on the family. If something could be done in respect of the income disregard I would welcome that. I would be happy to furnish the Minister with further details of this particular family's circumstances in the context of the review she will carry out, with a view to her potentially considering that family's scenario. I am sure it is typical of many scenarios throughout the country.

It is income. It is like the SUSI grant, where parents work extremely hard all of the hours God sends them in preparation to send a child to college. Suddenly the parent is assessed on the previous year's income, which they had worked so hard to get. Unfortunately, when we have means testing there will be cut-off points. In changing the system, I raised the limit to the €750 mark. That change included a lot more people. However, when there is a cut-off point somebody is going to lose out. I understand the situation the Deputy is talking about. In terms of carers, I would also like to see the HSE and the Department of Health step more into this space. I cannot pay people for the work they do; I can only support them in terms of their income. We should consider how we reward carers for the work they do.

Can the Minister provide us with an update on the legislation and when she expects to bring it to the House? It is obviously a very important piece of legislation and an important recommendation made by the group.

The child maintenance review group was established in 2020 to prepare a report on the current treatment within the Department of Social Protection of child maintenance payments, the current provisions relating to the liable relatives regarding child maintenance and the establishment of a child maintenance agency. These are very significant reforms of the social welfare system which will be of great benefit to lone parents. Introducing these changes requires amendments to primary and secondary legislation, the details of which are currently being examined. The reforms will also necessitate changes to some of my Department's systems, application forms and processes.

While the Department is not obliging parents to prove or show proof that they have sought maintenance, in practice is maintenance still being used in meeting the calculation of the lone parent payment? There was no agreement in the review group regarding the possibility of setting up a child maintenance service. It is important for the Minister to clarify her position regarding the possibility of such a service being established because, as she said, any changes that are made, and it is important they are made, do not remove the obligation on the non-custodial parent to maintain his or her child. This is what the legislation states. How are we going to support lone parents to ensure that happens and how do we do it outside the court environment, which is a difficult one for many lone parents?

I must make amendments to primary and secondary legislation. I am doing it on an administrative basis regarding the liable relative and the need to show proof you are seeking maintenance. The Department needs to distinguish between child and spousal maintenance, something which is not done at the moment, so my officials are working on advancing the various implementation issues to ensure early implementation of the reforms. We are doing what we can on an administrative basis but in terms of the means test, we must go through that and bring forward legislation, which I want to do as quickly as possible. There are a few issues we need to look at because legislation is complex and we might need to make adjustments in a number of different places. I will come back to the Deputy regarding child maintenance.

It is really important that these changes are made and they will make a difference to lone parent families. The Minister said the liable relative unit provision has been discontinued.

I appreciate the Minister cannot give a definite date but does she foresee this legislation being introduced in the first quarter of this year?

I cannot give a timeframe at the minute because there is a bit of work to be done on it. The Deputy asked me about the child maintenance agency. There was no consensus among the group regarding the establishment of a child maintenance agency. Even among members of the group who supported the establishment of such an agency, there were differing views about its role and remit as well as important constitutional concerns. The group examined the international position and after significant research, found that different countries have different arrangements. Unfortunately, there is no one perfect solution. Even if an agency was to be established, there would still be a significant role for the courts in terms of the difficult issues of enforcement and arrears. The Minister for Justice is planning significant reforms in the family justice area. I am particularly pleased that the family justice strategy includes a commitment to undertake a review of the enforcement of maintenance orders in the first half of this year. That is the important thing. If you are supposed to pay maintenance, you should pay it.  I would like to see a system whereby maintenance could be deducted at source but, again, it is something that must be teased out. Under such a system, no matter where you go, the maintenance is taken from your income. That would cut out a lot of administrative nonsense and having to go in and out of court. We want to stop that so if we could tie that up, it would make a difference.

Poverty is multidimensional and requires a whole-of-government approach. While income supports are important, access to affordable services such as housing, health, childcare and education are also critical. Budget 2023 provided a social welfare package worth almost €2.2 billion, which included a range of measures to support children. In addition to the one-off measures paid last year, personal rates of payment on working age schemes have been increased by €12 per week. In addition, the rates of payment for a qualified child has been increased to €42 per week for a child under 12 and €50 per week for a child over 12. I have also significantly increased funding for the school meals programme in recent years. More than €94 million has been provided for school meals in 2023, which is up from approximately €68 million in 2022. These are in addition to other Government measures such as the reduction in childcare costs and the commitment to introduce a free school book scheme for primary school pupils from this autumn. I have just set out in the previous question the benefits that will follow on from changes arising from the work of the child maintenance review group. The current national child poverty target requires a 66% reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty by the end of 2020 from its 2011 level. Between 2011 and 2021, the consistent poverty rate fell by 4.1 percentage points from 9.3% to 5.2%, so we can see that the measures taken to date have had a positive impact, although we still have further to go. The roadmap for social inclusion commits us to setting a new child poverty target. My Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are working together to progress this in the context of the development of a new policy framework for children and young people. Finally I should mention that the Taoiseach is establishing a new child poverty and well-being unit in his Department. The aim of this new unit is to build on what has already been achieved and provide greater focus on improving the lives and well-being of all children in Ireland.

However, 163,936 children in this country still live in consistent poverty according to the data presented last year. These are children without access to two warm coats and if their shoes are damaged, their parents are unable to replace. Regardless of whether the child goes hungry, there is certainly an adult in his or her house who does. I welcomed the fact that when the Taoiseach assumed office a couple of months ago, he said he would take this issue seriously. I had a funny image in my mind because he then had a meeting in Davos with Keir Starmer where they were going to talk about child poverty.  Child poverty is corrosive to the human condition. While I understand the measures the Minister is taking, income supports are what we need. I appreciate that welfare supports went up by €12 in the last budget but it is not enough. When we will see income supports going up towards the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, so that welfare supports in this country are not based below a line that automatically places not only the child but his or her family into poverty? Until we address that, all the targeted measures are not going to come to much.

I am not disputing that we need to do more but we were making progress. However, we were suddenly faced with a cost-of-living crisis. The Deputy can appreciate that we now need to focus on that. This crisis has had an impact and we need to focus on it. The new child poverty and well-being unit will be established in the Department of the Taoiseach in the first quarter of 2023. The Government is committed to reducing child poverty, as outlined in the programme for Government and the roadmap for social inclusion. However, poverty is multidimensional and requires a whole-of-government approach to provide the necessary supports.

I hope it goes across all Departments. The Ombudsman for Children asked for a child poverty strategy to be embedded in all Departments and I welcome this call.At its basis, poverty, whether that is childhood poverty or the poverty of a family, is about what a person is being asked to go without, such as food, warm clothes, shoes or the capacity to go to the cinema. That comes down to income. People have a right to be supported by the social welfare system. When will we see a social welfare rate that enables the child, and the family from which that child comes, to remove themselves from that capacity to go without? Within the lifetime of the Minister's Government, will welfare rates go towards the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, that is required? Until we get to that point, all the cross-departmental supports, which are welcome, will not matter a dot if we are still asking families in this country to go hungry. That is the essence of the matter.

I assure the Deputy the Government is totally committed to addressing the issue of child poverty. The Taoiseach has set up a special unit in his Department and by doing that, he can ensure all the Departments will feed into it. He and the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth have met some of the stakeholders to discuss the issues.

Pre-Covid, if you needed something like that, you would have a face-to-face meeting with a community welfare officer, CWO, whereas that is no longer the case. As a result, people desperately in need of support have nobody to talk to, and that needs to be remedied. It is a criticism not of any of the staff but rather of the lack of staffing and the lack of front-line personnel to deal with vulnerable and desperate people.

In addition to meeting citizens in the Intreo centres, branch offices and Department of Social Protection offices, community welfare officers can facilitate an appointment within a short time after someone requires such a meeting at an agreed location, including a person's home. Staffing levels have been maintained in the community welfare service nationwide in recent years, even during times when demands on the service decreased. This reflects my commitment to continuing to support the delivery of locally based services to clients. Currently, 412 people across all grades are working in the community welfare service, including 323 community welfare officers. Due to the increased number of applications received, agreement was reached with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform for approximately 74 additional staff for the community welfare service. These staff will be at all grades and will increase the capacity of community welfare officers to focus on making decisions relating to complex applications and meeting clients locally as required. Recruitment has commenced and I expect the additional staff will be in place during quarter 1 this year. In the meantime, the Department has assigned an additional 30 staff to the service. There are no backlogs of additional needs payment applications at present and work on hand is within the scheme's normal processing levels. Complete applications are finalised within two weeks and there is currently less than two weeks' work on hand. Where it is clear a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she will receive a payment on the same day. Approximately 10% of community welfare service payments to customers are made on this basis. We ran an extensive advertising campaign to make people aware this is the safety net to be used whenever help is needed. A lot of applications have come in and I am glad because that is what we want to see. We processed 97,000 applicants in 2022 alone and we have put more resources into the service. We are committed to providing this service, which is so necessary.

The husband, who used to work, developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. They were on a big top-up arrangement, which people on the housing assistance payment, HAP, should not have to pay, and as a result they fell into arrears, given the cost-of-living hikes. We eventually got an exceptional needs payment for them but it was not enough because at no point could they meet an individual to explain the complexities of their case. The Minister said unscheduled meetings with CWOs are available, but I am afraid that is not true. I tabled a question about the hotline that can be called, which she will come to later in this session. If you call that hotline, you will encounter very nice people at the other end of the phone but they are not community welfare officers. They are people who will send you out forms to be filled out. There have been a number of cases of desperate people who did not get their exceptional needs payments until after Christmas, so had very little money, and they would not have got them without the assistance of my office. I can give another example of a man whose wife has cancer. He cannot turn down the heating but, because she is on illness benefit, he is not entitled to the fuel allowance or the additional needs payment. These are difficult, complex circumstances for vulnerable people and they need to be explained to a human being. That is not a criticism of the staff. It is a criticism that there has been a change in the availability of human beings to talk to in the community welfare service.

There have been other incidents where people have come forward with details, and when I looked them up, I discovered they were somewhat different from what was initially anticipated. While I fully accept the bona fides of the cases the Deputy raised, I would like to look into them to see exactly what happened because we have put every effort into reducing the length of time within which a decision is made. Community welfare officers are available to meet people. They can do so by appointment and there is no problem in doing that. If members of the public visit an Intreo office, they can meet the officers face to face. We have increased the number of staff in the offices and, as I said, we processed 97,000 payments last year. That is a lot of processing. There is no backlog and we are down to two weeks. While some cases will take slightly longer, that is most likely because applicants have not got all the information they need. Each case is individual. As I said, I will be happy to look at the two specific cases the Deputy brought to my attention.

My point is that many of the cases of desperate people are complicated. The case of somebody who has fallen into arrears on his rent because he is paying a HAP top-up, that is, someone whose wife has Alzheimer's disease, who used to work and whose HAP tenancy is based on an income he no longer has, is complicated. It is very difficult to explain on a form or a phone call. You need to be sitting with an individual to explain those complexities. The same is true of a person who is receiving long-term illness benefit when, arguably, he should be on a different payment, and so on. These are complicated cases. The Minister suggested it is easy to get a face-to-face meeting with a community welfare officer, but that is not the experience we are getting. Sometimes it is not possible even to get one at all.I do want to acknowledge that, when our office gets on to divisional management, it can be very helpful, but without our assistance, many of those people would not have got payments at all. There is something wrong with staffing levels that we cannot have the availability of more face-to-face community welfare officers who are easily accessible.

There is a full-time community welfare officer present in more than 50 Intreo offices nationwide, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. I accept there can be some very complex cases but the majority, 80% of cases, are processed in a short time. That is an indication of the service we are providing. There may be some complex cases. I am happy to look at the two specific cases the Deputy mentioned to me. We can discuss them later and I will get the details. Much of the evidence I am getting is anecdotal and I need to see the specific cases. If people have cases they want to bring to my attention, I am happy to look them up and find out exactly what happened because I want to make sure people get the service. We have an increased number of applications and approximately 74 staff to be assigned to the community welfare service. Recruitment has commenced. In most cases, they receive their payment within two weeks provided they have all the information they need. That is a big improvement on where it was.

I was looking for the information by county from 2016 to date. I do not necessarily need the Minister to read it out. I can get it in writing. I am more interested in the action the Minister is taking to make people aware of the mobile unit and the home visit service.

My Department does not currently have a specific mobile unit available in which to meet with customers, and the requirement for such has not been currently identified. We do, from time to time, make arrangements to visit a person who may be incapacitated at his or her place of residence, for example, to process an application for a public service card or to assist a person complete an application. Given the relatively low numbers involved, no statistics are maintained on this activity. In addition, community welfare officers, CWO, can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home. Separately the development of our online service portal mywelfare.ie means a growing number of customers can access the Department's services without having to post a paper form or call into their local Intreo centre. This is the quickest and easiest way for a person to apply for most income supports and payment statements. Last year in excess of 2.7 million transactions were completed through this portal, bringing the total number of transactions to date to more than 10 million. It may interest Deputies to know that usage of the portal by people over 65 years was as high as that by people aged 18 to 24 years.

She is unable to leave the house and is barely able to speak. She had her disability payment being paid directly into her Ulster Bank account, but as Ulster Bank is closing, she was transferring it to the post office so that her husband could pick it up for her. However, to do that, she needed a public services card. She was told to call in to the Intreo office but she was unable to do so. It took weeks to sort this out and to establish finally that there was a mobile unit, or at least that is how it was described when the email came back from Sligo to say there is a mobile unit assigned to each area. The personnel in Cavan did not seem to be aware of this. Someone eventually called out to her, but in the meantime they were unable to pick up three of her disability payments over the whole Christmas period. Luckily, they had put some money aside and were able to manage, but they would not have been able to manage for much longer. It just caused a lot of upset. They felt the way they were dealt with was insensitive. I know people receive disability payments for all sorts of reasons and most disabled people are more than independent and able to go into the Intreo office, but there are some who may have mobility issues and are not able to. I raise this so that even the staff would be aware of the service and be able to inform people, because they were not aware this time.

They have a camera so that they can take the photographs. That can be arranged. I am sorry the lady was disturbed over Christmas. I am happy to check out that particular case for the Deputy. I can only say that it is not nice if you do not have money over Christmas. As I understand, the Department can facilitate an in-person appointment within a short time for a person requiring such a meeting. We know the community welfare offices in our own areas. They are exceptionally good and exceptionally caring in the work they do. I know they go beyond the call of duty on many occasions. In the case mentioned by the Deputy, I cannot say why she did not get the PSC as soon as she could but we will check it out. However, on the broader point, there are many ways by which people can make their applications.

The Intreo office did give him a temporary card and, eventually, when he was able to get access to staff, someone visited her home afterwards, but it caused a lot of trouble. She also got a letter to say she was allocated a free travel pass and needed to present at the Intreo office to access that. Everyone's disability is different. In this case the people just felt it was a little insensitive.

I will get someone from my office to contact the Deputy to trawl through that so that it does not happen again. It is not our intention. It is possible to ring up and get an appointment with a community welfare officer who will visit the house if a person is incapacitated and cannot travel. I can give that commitment because it does happen. On the broader issue, there are many ways by which people can make their applications. They can call into the social welfare or Intreo office, they can pick up the phone and ring us, they can apply online or, where they need it, they can even arrange for a member of staff to meet them in their own home. That, for some reason, did not happen.

I will further elaborate the problem. The Minister is saying that community welfare officers, CWOs, are there and people can get appointments. I am telling her that is not the experience that is being relayed to us. That is not happening. In the old days, people could go down to the CWO without any prior notice and queue up to see them. They cannot do that now. We need to go back to face to face.

I mentioned the man with early-onset Alzheimer's, who is also in a housing assistance payment, HAP, arrangement where he had to pay a top-up. Before getting Alzheimer's, he was working and could make the top-up. Since he got Alzheimer's, he cannot work or make the top-up and is falling into arrears. No appointment was possible. With our assistance, eventually an application with all the bits and bobs goes in and a cheque arrives for €600, but the arrears, which are not the fault of the people but of their complex circumstances, are €1,000. Their problem is not solved. They needed to talk to an individual to explain their circumstances. I do not blame the CWOs because clearly they are overrun. We need staffing levels in the service that allow people to go to the CWO and explain complicated circumstances and get responses which acknowledge the complexity, difficulty and, often, desperation of the situation they are in.

There are a number of ways in which people can make applications. They can call into any social welfare or Intreo office. They can pick up the phone and ring us. They can apply online or, where they need it, they can even arrange for a member of staff to meet them in their home. There are many options available to people. The case the Deputy referred to is complex, but if a person rings up and asks for an appointment to see a community welfare officer, the officer will go to that person’s house. That is the arrangement. I am happy to take the details and look into the case to find all of the information. I will come back to the Deputy as to why the arrears of €1,000 were not given. I cannot say why they did not get it but am happy to look it up and find out exactly what happened.

The other case I mentioned is also complex. I will not go over the details again but, just to be clear, it concerns a woman with cancer whose husband cannot turn down the heat and so has big bills. Because she is on illness benefit, she is not entitled to fuel allowance and, therefore, got none of the extra payments for that allowance. This is terrible stuff. The husband of that woman has been in my office about six or seven times saying he cannot get a face-to-face meeting with the CWO. I am not criticising the CWO because I am sure that CWO is overrun. The Minister is right they are humane people but the problem is, once upon a time it was possible yo meet the humane person. Now there are loads of barriers to getting meetings. What the Minister describes is not what it used to be. It has changed and it is not a good change. When it was possible to queue up and see the CWO on the day was better than what we have now.

There are 74 additional staff to be assigned to the community welfare service. In the interim, we assigned 30 social welfare inspectors to the service to make sure claims were dealt with speedily. There is no backlog and we are down to two weeks. That is fair. Though online applications do not apply to the case the Deputy spoke about, I was pleased to see when my officials went through the statistics that there were as many people over 65 years old using the online service as there were 18- to 24-year-olds. It goes to show more and more senior citizens are going digital like the rest of us. There are options: go online, pick up the phone, call into the social welfare office, or, if needed, a member of staff will go out to the applicant.

The CWS is committed to providing a quality service to all citizens, ensuring applications are processed and decisions on entitlement are made quickly. There are no backlogs at present and work on hand is within the scheme's normal processing levels. Complete applications are mostly finalised within two weeks and there is less than two weeks' work in process currently. It is important to note that, where it is clear a person has an urgent or immediate need, every effort is made to ensure the claim is processed on the same day. CWOs are very experienced and can generally assess when a case is so urgent that it requires an immediate response. Approximately 10% of CWS payments to customers are made on this basis, which shows how responsive the service is to urgent customer need. Where an application cannot be finalised promptly, the delay is normally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person to support his or her application and the length of time it takes for the information to be provided. This can result in longer processing times for these applications as greater flexibility is given to clients, with extended time to respond. Upon receipt of this information, the application is processed quickly. I would appreciate if the Deputy would let me know of any persons who are having difficulty in accessing support for a deposit or first month's rent. Much effort and resources have been applied to the CWS over recent months to ensure it is a responsive and available service for people. I trust this clarifies the matter.

I am hearing the applications are taking weeks, if not months, to be processed. I have been contacted by a tenancy sustainment and support officer who works with people who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless. They are referred by the local authority to this person, who helps them get viewings of properties. Most are on social welfare and do not have the means to save for the deposit and first month’s rent. Cavan County Council does not operate a homeless HAP system so they have no option but to apply for the additional needs payment to cover these costs. It results in a catch-22 situation because if they get a viewing at the property, which is very difficult in the current climate, they cannot afford the deposit and first month's rent. There is no assistance available, they apply for the additional needs payment, it is taking too long, the landlord gives the property to somebody with money readily available and they miss out. This is happening constantly. Something needs to be done to address it. We have a homeless crisis and it will get worse. I am talking about a city or large urban centre in Cavan.

There will sometimes be cases where all the information is not provided and it takes longer. If the Deputy gives me the specific case, I am happy to have it looked into. Specific cases are what I need. Sometimes when all the information comes to hand, it might not be what it originally seemed to be. I am not saying that is true of the Deputy’s case in Cavan. We have put more staff into this section and there are a number of ways people can contact the service. They can go into the Intreo office in Cavan, which is open five days a week, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. They can see a community welfare officer in there and explain their situation.Some of the work is being done at a central office, which has helped to eradicate the backlog. There is no backlog now. We have been working extremely hard in trying to get these numbers down because we want to help people. That is what we are here for.

Two weeks for some payments might be sufficient but for this case, where it is for a deposit or rent, an immediate payment is needed. Otherwise, the tenancy will be gone because there is such a demand. I do not know why the system was changed because there is an old saying that goes, if it is not broken, do not fix it. Before this, somebody in the local authority who knew the person locally would have worked in the community welfare office and a good relationship would have been built up. That person could contact the office and say we have an urgent case of somebody fleeing a domestic violence situation or who is homeless and needs a payment, and the payment was processed within a day or two and resolved. That is not happening now, however. Like Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier, I am hearing that community welfare officers are not available either. There was a time when they used to have scheduled clinics at different times throughout the county and people could just drop in. That is not happening now from what I am hearing the ground. That was a great system where people just went to them and there was a personal touch and, as the Minister said, a humane attitude. Returning to that system could help resolve many issues on the ground.

People can call into the social welfare Intreo office, pick up the telephone and ring us or apply online. If someone needs a member of staff, we will go out to his or her house. Those are all options. As I said, it is working because the number of claims waiting to be processed is down. There are two weeks in hand and there is a two-week turnaround time. If it is urgent, however, it is genuinely dealt with on the same day. In terms of domestic violence, I changed that process. We can provide a rent supplement to people who are victims of domestic violence by way of a referral from Tusla and other designated organisations. This referral, along with the completed grant supplement application form, will allow victims of domestic violence a fast-track approval and screening process with a simplified means test to access a rent supplement for an initial three-month period. They can get that straight away for three months. That was something I was pleased we were able to introduce because that is a very difficult place for people to find themselves. An exceptional needs payment to cover a deposit and the first month's rent can also be provided promptly to a person in this situation. If the Deputy wants to give me the specific details, I will follow up on why it was not received immediately by that individual.

Accordingly, the current State pension system gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or provide another full-time caring role. PRSI credits, homemaking disregards and home caring periods recognise caring periods of up to 20 years outside of paid employment in the calculation of a payment rate. Despite these measures, some long-term carers of incapacitated dependants may still face barriers in accessing the State pension. They may, for example, have difficulty establishing the minimum number of ten years' paid contributions. I announced a series of landmark reforms to the State pension system in September. The measures are in response to the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions and represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State pension system. One of the most important reforms agreed by Government is enhanced State pension provision for people who have been caring for incapacitated dependants for more than 20 years. It will do this by attributing the equivalent of paid contributions to long-term carers to cover gaps in their contribution record and by establishing a register of family carers for this purpose. Department officials are currently working to implement the reforms, including the drafting of legislation and development of administrative and IT systems, as necessary.

When this was announced initially and the Minister spoke about it in September, she said she expected the pension for family carers to be in place from January 2024. I appreciate that much work has to go into this. However, could the Minister let us know whether she still intend for that to be the timeline and that she foresees this being in place and ready for next January? The register is a positive move. Even aside from the State pension for family carers, it will be good to have a register. I understand the Minister will work with Family Carers Ireland in that regard, which is welcome. I have come across a number of cases where that rule of needing to have 520 contributions in the ten years before a person can access the credit has been a difficulty for some carers. As part of the ongoing work the Minister's Department is doing on checking people who are caring for the purposes of the register, can this be looked at in terms of the total contributions approach where evidence had to be provided for people to access credits? Some of that work might be already done.

As the Deputy knows, we are doing much work to support carers, which is absolutely correct because they really do great work. There is no doubt about that. My officials are looking at the legislation we need to change. That is being written as we speak. The Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, of which Deputy Kerrane is a member, is also looking on this issue along with auto-enrolment and will be bringing a report to me, which I look forward to reading when it comes to hand. We have a list of those who received the carer's support grant and a list of those on carer's allowance. However, we need to find the cohort who are receiving neither of those supports. We will work with stakeholders and representative groups to see how we can come up with a register. That is part of the work and it will take a bit of time.

That is really important because for a long time now, family carers who have ceased their caring role and sought their State pension have not been able to access a full State pension. In fairness, they were more than entitled to it after the years of care they provided. This has put family carers in really difficult situations. This is, therefore, a really welcome move. I hope that it will be brought about as quickly as possible. In terms of total contributions approach, the Department had to look into each case where someone was looking for credits. People had to prove they had children. It was said at the time that the Department would be looking at child benefit and if people were receiving carer's allowance, that would help as well. I presume a similar system will be put in place to show carers who are caring when it comes to them accessing that pension when it is rolled out. Some of that work may be done already and could be expanded into that area.

I have two simple questions.

We are trying to make sure people who have genuinely been caring for more than 20 years get the benefit of this. It is important that they get this pension. They have cared all their lives and find that when they come to pension age, because of their partner's income, they cannot get anything because it is means-tested. We are trying to deal with this. We expect to have the legislation in the second half of this year. Deputy Sherlock can appreciate that there is a bit of work to be done in trying to make sure we get it right. That is the most important thing. We are working on it as we speak. As I said, I am looking forward to getting those reports from the joint Oireachtas committee. We want to move this on and these are two big changes. State pension reform and auto-enrolment are fundamental changes we are making to the system and a good deal of work is involved. I have many people working on it who have spent much time on it already.

Domiciliary care allowance claims registered stood at 10,524, with 7,872 claims awarded and 2,084 appeals. There were 22,841 claims registered for carer's allowance, with 14,921 claims awarded and 3,521 appeals. During 2022, the Department continued to receive an increased number of claims across all of these schemes. Claim volumes for disability allowance increased by more than 26% year on year and more than 8% on its pre-pandemic level in 2019. Claims volumes for domiciliary care allowance and for carer's allowance increased by more than 15% and 16% respectively compared with 2021, and between 18% and 21% on their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Notwithstanding these increases in workloads, improvements in processing times made in recent years were maintained, with claim decisions being made in an average of six weeks compared with 12 to 19 weeks in 2017, and ten to 14 weeks in 2019. It should be noted that the number of claims awarded include cases that were previously disallowed or refused and subsequently found eligible on review or appeal. In addition, the total number of claims received in a calendar year will not equal the number of claims awarded or disallowed in the same year. Claims awarded, disallowed or appealed may relate to claims received in previous calendar years.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18327	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	68	I welcome the comprehensive set of figures there, but it is glaring that across disability allowance, domiciliary care allowance, and carer's allowance applications, there are approximately 5,000 appeals for disability allowance, 2,000 appeals for domiciliary care allowance, and 3,500 for carer's allowance. I have posed the question because if there is a way of further streamlining the process, particularly for parents where applications are made for domiciliary care allowance, this would be very helpful. This is on the basis that the weight of medical evidence that must be supplied is burdensome. People understand they have to do it, and obviously we must have checks and balances to ensure the scheme delivers what it is supposed to deliver. Nobody argues against that. However, when a decision is made by a Department's deciding medical officer, very often it poses questions as to the legitimacy of that decision. Given the weight of the medical evidence that has been submitted, people feel understandably annoyed where their initial applications are turned down and, in many cases, the decisions are overturned on appeal. There are still quite a number that do not reach oral hearing level. With the domiciliary care allowance in particular, the fact that 2,000 applications have gone to appeal has to tell us something about the system and whether it is working.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	69	Each scheme has multiple conditionality such as medical, caring, means and residency. A key criteria is that the applicant satisfies the medical-related conditionality. To assess this, the Department employs its own team of more than 30 doctors who have a mix of skills and specialties and who are specially trained to assess the impact of a medical condition on a person's capacity to work or on his or her care needs. The focus is not to disallow a claim but to try to understand the impact of the underlying condition on the claimant or the person in their care. Often when a claim is appealed, we find that applicants provide additional information to that provided with the initial claim. This is the main reason appeals succeed. There are a number of reasons applicants do not submit this information with the initial claim, partly because they may not have had reports from specialists or consultants available to them when they made the claim but they wished to establish a claim date as early as possible. That is understandable. People sometimes say to them to get their claim in, they put the claim in, and then follow up with the additional information, because when the claim is granted it is backdated.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18327	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	70	What we have is a situation where one consultant or medical professional is overturning the decision of another. This, effectively, is what is happening when the medical examiner looks at the case. For example, I go to my consultant who knows me, has a relationship with me and completely understands the nature of my complaint. That could then be overturned by somebody who never meets the applicant, who never interacts with the applicant and who is making a decision against the applicant. It has always been thus, and maybe it is time for us, given that the Minister is reforming in nature, perhaps to look at this again. There are three very particular schemes for which thousands of people make applications where decisions are made on medical grounds on the basis of what is arguably a desktop exercise. If the Minister saw fit to look at that again and perhaps review it, that would be very helpful.

There are so many schemes, including the carer's allowance. I know of so many people going into appeals where the Department wants further information. There is a far higher refusal rate than I have ever seen before. I would question this. When we look at it, people who are caring are looking after people instead of them being in hospitals or in homes, and yet every time a decision is appealed the Department wants further information. It is also being means tested, which is a huge issue. It is of course the same for the domiciliary allowance or any of the schemes. I am dealing with a lovely lady at the moment who has a child with a disability. Although the child is actually in school for a few hours, this lady had to give up work to be the carer. This lady qualifies for nothing because her husband earns barely over the limit. As others have said, we need to look at certain schemes to see what we can do to help those who are vulnerable and doing their best to help the system. The system is letting them down.

There needs to be a review by the Minister of the regulations, the way they are applied and the outcomes. Having attended at appeal hearings over many years, I have seen the basis on which decisions are made. On one occasion not so long ago I attended a hearing where the person won the appeal only for it to be overturned by an executive officer who, to my mind, had no authority to do so other than a conflict whereby the same officer was adjudicating on their own decision, as it were. Will the Minister, if she gets a chance, look at that area where there could be a difficulty created for people who have a life-long commitment to caring for relatives?

I hear the concerns they raise. I had one case in my constituency office of a child who had been diagnosed from birth with a particular disorder but the medical evidence did not stack up and they did not get the disability allowance. They were moving from domiciliary care to disability care but they did not get it. They did not provide the information. I told them they would have to go back to their specialist and get a letter. They said they would not go back. They said that what they had supplied should have been sufficient. Unfortunately, as we all know, doctors differ. I will certainly take on board what the Deputies have and I am happy to take a look at it. Applicants should not withhold information in order to have additional information to submit if they need to appeal. They must not do that. Submit all of the information in the first instance. Sometimes the medical information is not sufficient and they must go back to get more information. A lot of the cases are actually granted on appeal. I would say to all applicants to submit as much information as possible with the initial claim and I ask all public representatives to do the same. The Department is also working closely with the advocacy groups, including the DCA Warriors and Carers Ireland to review and change its application forms. If the Deputies have any ideas they would like to give to me, I will be happy to take them.

The Minister had confirmed in the past week at the committee the hope that all supervisors would be looked at once and for all in respect of the ongoing talks, which is very welcome. Can I ask for an update on the engagement to date, please?
#JoeOBrien	unknown-#JoeOBrien-party	unknown-#JoeOBrien-dob	unknown-#JoeOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	76	I thank the Deputy for the question. The 1,640 supervisors and assistant supervisors provide a very important role running over 840 community employment, CE, and other schemes countrywide. As the Deputy knows, these schemes deliver important locally-based community services, while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those furthest removed from the labour market. CE supervisors and assistant supervisors are employees of the individual CE schemes, which are funded by the Department. Neither the Department nor the State are the employer of this group of workers. As the funder of CE schemes, the Department of Social Protection is in ongoing contact with CE supervisors' representatives, including union representatives, on employment-related matters. On the specific issue on pay, in the past year, the Department received correspondence from Fórsa and SIPTU seeking a pay increase for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors. Fórsa and SIPTU, along with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, subsequently referred this pay claim to the conciliation service of the Workplace Relations Commission. The WRC issued an invitation to the Department to take part in a conciliation process. Following Government approval, the Department responded to the WRC indicating that it will engage with a WRC conciliation process, in its role as funder of these schemes. This conciliation process is now under way, with the first meeting in the WRC held in the past week on Thursday, 2 February. Departmental officials attended and engaged with ICTU, Fórsa and SIPTU representatives to progress the this issue.  As the Deputy will appreciate, while this process is under way I am not in a position to comment further other than to say I am hopeful that an agreed and fair resolution can be reached through this conciliation process.  It should be noted that any increase in CE supervisor pay rates that would increase the overall cost to the State of funding employment schemes must take into consideration the potential cost to the Exchequer, and ultimately the taxpayer. Therefore, the Department will also continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform during the WRC process. If there are budgetary implications arising from the WRC process, these will need Government approval.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I are fully committed to the CE schemes and recognise the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services and in helping long-term unemployed participants back to work.

They provide services that in many cases would otherwise simply not exist. The supervisors and the assistant supervisors, in particular, have a significant responsibility when it comes to the running of these schemes, particularly because of the people and the communities they serve and their importance. I wish to clarify one issue. The WRC talks and initial engagement came on the back of the pay claim that was submitted for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors. In respect of supervisors within Tús and the rural social scheme, RSS; is that being looked at either separately to the pay claim or as part of it, because that was mentioned in the committee last week? I thank the Minister of State.

We were eager, when we were going through a process like this and when there are schemes with quite strong similarities that are all couched under the employment support schemes I oversee, that they would be looked at in the whole and that would be important. We are eager to look at CE, Tús, RSS and the job initiative, JI, supervisors in this process.

The supervisors, be it in Tús, RSS or in community employment, have not seen a pay rise since 2008, which is a long time. During that period, they have had additional workload and responsibilities because of the demand within the communities for the support of those schemes. In many cases, there has been a great deal more demand from the public and people in communities for assistance for various clubs and organisations that require and seek the support of all of these very important schemes on the ground. This is welcome and I hope that progress will be made without delay through the WRC.There obviously will be a major role for the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in all of this. It needs to be to the fore to ensure that whenever a deal is made that it is progressed as quickly as possible.

I am aware that the talks have been going on since April, with a 2% increase in November and a further 1% increase thereafter. This is unacceptable. A great deal more talking need to happen. The CE supervisors have not had an increase since 2008, which is 15 years ago. I met a group of CE supervisors recently who told me there are some people on the CE scheme who, because of the welcome increases provided by the Minister, are earning more money than the CE supervisors themselves. I am delighted that the Minister of State is talking but I ask him to ensure that he gives the proper increase to our CE supervisors and to their assistants. The work they do in our communities is very valuable. I know that both Ministers are committed to this, for which I thank them for that and that they are aware of the importance of a proper increase in their pay.

The purpose of an additional needs payment is to assist with essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. In 2022, over 97,000 additional needs payments were issued at a total value of over €58 million. More than €66 million has been provided for additional needs payments in 2023. However, the budget for this scheme is demand-led and is not subject to an overall cap. There are 412 staff across all grades in the community welfare service, including 323 community welfare officers based locally throughout the country.  In light of the increased level of applications, agreement had been reached for approximately 74 additional staff to be assigned to the community welfare service. Recruitment has commenced for these additional staff through a combination of appointments from Public Appointments Service panels, internal promotions and expressions of interest from existing staff within the Department.  We are on track to have these additional staff in place by the end of the first quarter of this year. In the interim, 30 social welfare inspectors were temporarily reassigned to assist with claims processing. This and other measures undertaken during the past year mean there are no backlogs at present and work on hand is within the schemes normal processing levels.  Completed applications are finalised within two weeks and there is less than two weeks work on hand currently.  Where it is clear that a person has an urgent or immediate need, every effort is made to ensure that the claim is processed on the same day. Community welfare officers are very experienced and can generally assess when a case is so urgent that it requires an immediate response. Approximately 10% of payments to customers across the country are made on this basis, which shows just how responsive the service is to an urgent customer need.

I will draw attention to one particular cohort, namely, people living with district heating systems. Many of them who have been in touch with me are facing utterly unsustainable bills. There are high energy costs in these systems that are not controlled by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. People using such systems do not have the option to move companies the way the rest of us do. I have questioned CRU about this at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and the lack of protection and options or choices to move mean they face uncontrollable heating bills. Many of them have been turned down by CWOs. I ask the Minister to give these people a favourable view, and instruct the CWOs to cut them a little slack, because of the crises they face and the lack of protections the State offers them.

We spent €58 million on it last year. There is a budget for this year and if the scheme requires more money, that is not a problem. We will provide it. The additional needs payment, through the community welfare service, is the State's safety net for people who get into difficulty. I have been in politics for 20 years and have always dealt with the local CWOs. They have always done their best to help people, as has the Deputy. I value the CWOs. The delivery of this service is a priority for me and my Department. Where people are in need, I want to make sure they get support. That is why we had a major communications campaign to raise awareness of the additional needs payment. In 2022, 97,000 applications were processed. That is up significantly since 2021. The additional needs payment is available to those in financial hardship. People are finding that their ESB bills are increasing. There is another €200 credit. We have already paid out €400 in credit.

I will revisit the question of those living with district heating systems. Many of them are approaching a lot of Deputies. These systems are not regulated by the CRU so they do not fall under any regulation. The utilities can charge what they like. They charge much more than what the Minister and I pay for gas coming into our homes. On top of that, the people affected live mainly in apartment complexes. Many of them are good earners but they are paying bills that are at an incredible rate, with no regulations and no control over the prices. In addition, they do not have the option to shop around. We are constantly being told to shop around and change providers but they do not have that option. There has to be a set of guidelines for CWOs.

What are the Minister's plans to change the legal status of childminders, which would make possible the future regulation of childminders and allow access to the national childcare scheme to be opened in future to parents who use registered childminders? I ask for more information on that.

Many childminders are currently excluded from registration and, therefore, from the national childcare scheme because of exemptions in the Child Care Act 1991. To bring all childminders within the scope of registration and the national childcare scheme subsidies requires an amendment to this Act. Childminding offers many benefits to children and parents but until now it has received little formal recognition by the State. It has remained at the margins of funding, support and regulation, despite its many advantages and its continued popularity among parents. I know that many parents who use childminders are keen for these measures to be taken as quickly as possible, in order that they can benefit from the significant increase in national childcare scheme subsidies I introduced at the start of January this year.

I have often spoken on this matter. Childminders are invaluable. Theirs is the service I used due to the nature of my current work and when I previously worked for a trade union, where the hours are so uncertain. Many people are in that situation, including those doing shift work or not doing the traditional 9 to 5 hours. There are so many roles like that where childminders are invaluable. It would be great to bring them into the system. Will that have to go through the whole legislative process or will it be done through a simple amendment? Is that legislation envisaged for this year? What would the difference be? There is obviously significant regulation in this area. Nobody has a difficulty with that for centre-based childcare but regulation would have to be fair to both childminders and centre-based childcare in order that there are not two totally different sets of regulations, even though I recognise childminding is different, as we all do. In order that it is fair, is it envisaged that the subsidy will be the same for both types of childcare? Has that been looked at yet?

Those will be quite substantial and will include revising the law in the area of the taking of children into care because the 1991 legislation needs to be changed. Tusla's powers of inspection for centre-based childcare will also be included within that legislation. We will add a power in that the Minister will be given the power to create regulations for childminders. It is to be hoped, all things going well and working well with the committee the Deputy chairs, we might get that legislation passed by the end of this year or possibly early next year. We are also engaging with childminding groups. I met with Childminding Ireland, the largest representative group for childminders, two weeks ago. We are engaging with childminders on the scope of these regulations. We need a regulatory structure. That is correct in assuring quality for children and parents but we also need to recognise, as the Deputy said, that childminding in the home is different to centre-based childcare.

It would be great to complete the legislation this year in order that it could come into force next year. Those of us familiar with this sector have often wondered how to encourage more people to register. I have always thought there is sometimes a fear that, all of a sudden, somebody who has been childminding for years but was not registered believes there will be some sort of backlash.These proposals, therefore, are good. It is timely that people would get the subsidy. It is great for parents not to be reliant on centre-based childcare. We also know about, and often talk here about, the capacity of centre-based childcare at the moment. If childminders can avail of this scheme too, it will be beneficial. The other point I wanted to make, which the Minister kind of covered, was about the consultation. I know that Childminding Ireland is the significant group in that regard, but the regulations should be drafted in consultation with it. Any input from parents or advocacy groups would also be helpful.

Not only did I write to it but I also asked it to distribute a letter from me across childminders in its network setting out what we are doing with the childminding action plan and what the next steps are. I know, even from a couple of emails I got when the announcement was made last year, that there is some fear among childminders as to what we are seeking to do. I think everyone agrees that this is a positive step. We are looking to create childminder-specific regulations, different from the regulatory structure for centre-based childcare. There will be an open registration process to encourage childminders to sign up and to register. We know that this is new and different and will be a change for many of them. Once they register, however, the big plus in all this, as well as being able to assure quality, is to give parents the benefit of the cuts to fees. Parents who use childminders will get the same benefit of the cuts we achieved for parents who use centre-based childcare from 1 January of this year. I think that is something we all wish to achieve.

A Government decision in December 2022 confirmed that the transfer of policy, functions and funding responsibility relating to specialist community-based disability services from the Minister for Health to me, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, would take place on 1 March of this year. The colocation of disability equality policy and community-based disability services functions in a single Department from 1 March will facilitate strategic policy development, including the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the advancement of the disability capacity review through the Action Plan for Disability Services. This will ultimately enhance the fulfilment of the rights of children and adults with disabilities in respect of a number of critical UNCRPD articles. As for assessment of need specifically, I am committed to delivering real and tangible solutions to enhance services. I will focus on addressing challenges as regards the resourcing of children's disability network teams and implementing effectively the progressing disability services programme in order to target long waiting lists and to enable the provision of timely and appropriate therapies. The revised assessment of needs standard operating procedure, once approved, will be implemented with a clear focus on clearing the assessment of need backlog, although it is important to note that children do not require an assessment of need under the Disability Act to access health services. Many children in receipt of therapy services have not gone through the assessment of need process. It is anticipated that the interim clinical guidance will be finalised shortly. The HSE has been allocated funding in budget 2023 to facilitate additional assessments through a suite of measures, including the establishment of dedicated assessment of need teams, private procurement, overtime initiatives for existing staff and the recruitment of administrative resources to free up therapists in order to assist with assessments of need.

I am aware of 15 families who have adolescent children with autism and moderate learning disabilities who urgently require a psychiatrist's review while being told by the HSE that that service is unavailable as there are no psychiatrists on the HSE team. In addition to no psychiatrists being available, the only paediatrician available in Louth and Meath is Dr. Maeve McCormack. Dr. McCormack will see only children who are 16 years of age or younger. There is a four- to five-month waiting list to see Dr. McCormack. CAMHS will not see teenagers who have a dual diagnosis, while these adolescent children cannot be seen by mental health teams until they are 18 years old. Assessment of need is a statutory process under the Disability Act 2005, whereby the Health Service Executive reports on the health needs and, more recently, the education of a child. That is not being done. There is a loophole. We need a bit of help. I have raised this with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, over recent years and we are getting nowhere with it. Our health service is in crisis. If a child goes into an accident and emergency department or a hospital and there is a sudden diagnosis of a disability, nobody wants to look after the child. The child is left in limbo. The family is left in limbo.

I am looking forward, from 1 March, to taking on the responsibility for delivery of disability services for children and adults. The Deputy is absolutely right about the crucial issue of the assessment of needs. He knows the history of this. He knows that a new process had been adopted over a number of years. That was challenged in the courts. That process was found not to meet the requirements under the Disability Act, and that requires a reassessment of a very significant number of children and a new assessment process to be in place. We want to ensure that the new assessment process meets fully the criteria of the Disability Act. We do not want this same thing happening again. That is what is taking place now. There is an understanding in not only clinical terms but also legal terms that the new standard operating procedure for the assessment of needs is clinically and legally robust. That will allow us to tackle the backlog and, going forward, will allow children newly presenting to seek assessments of need.

I have parents coming to my office regularly. They go to CAMHS and everybody is trying to help, but they are not getting the help. What happens, as I mentioned a few weeks ago, is that parents end up taking their children to accident and emergency departments. If the child is 16 years of age, he or she is put into an acute ward. Then, all of a sudden, the child is in limbo. People automatically think that if they contact a Deputy, a Senator or someone else involved in politics, that person will be able to help. We cannot help. The amount of money being spent in the HSE at the moment is unreal. What do we tell parents who come in to us and whose children are self-harming, with suicidal thoughts and everything else? Where do they go? They go to CAMHS and, especially if they have some kind of disability, they have nowhere else to go. They come in to us looking for a bit of help. We come here to ask the Department for help. This has been going on for a long time. We have been told that even some accident and emergency departments are supposed to have special services for people under the age of 18 who do present as suicidal. It is not happening. What system can the Minister put in place that will help parents who come in to us in order that we can comfort them and tell them the system will work? It is not working.

CAMHS will continue to fall within the remit of the Department of Health. It is not moving over with community-based specialist services. I do, however, take the Deputy's point about the issue of dual diagnosis, that is, cases in which there is a disability diagnosis and a mental health diagnosis as well. It has been an issue that one or two of my constituents have raised. We will have to engage on that with the Department of Health and work with the HSE to give parents absolute clarity as to who takes on the primary responsibility of treatment in that situation. The Deputy spoke to the staffing pressures he is experiencing in Louth and Meath, and that is a huge issue. We have set up the CDNTs across the country, but too many of them are understaffed. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I, working with the HSE, will bring forward a roadmap on progressing disability services. That will, among other things, seek to tackle the issue of retention and recruitment of staff, which is where the biggest vulnerability is right now. Where we do not have staff, we have backlogs in terms of not only the assessment but also the delivery of those much-needed therapies.

To date the State has provided accommodation to more than 55,000 beneficiaries of the temporary protection directive. In response to the crisis, the Government has sought to provide a range of accommodation solutions in every county in Ireland, including Cavan. As part of this considerable national effort, the Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid-build homes on State-owned land, which will aim to provide accommodation to 2,800 individuals in family units. The Office of Public Works, OPW, is supporting the development of the rapid-build accommodation in conjunction with my Department. The OPW and my Department are currently rolling out the first phase of the programme of rapid-build homes on sites identified in Cork, Cavan, Tipperary, Sligo and Mayo. The installation of some of the homes has begun and this work will continue over the coming months. A comprehensive communications approach has been applied for each of the sites that have been identified for the first phase. The site in Cavan, on OPW land off the Farnham Road, was identified as having capacity for 28 units. It is planned that all works on the Cavan site will be completed at the beginning of April and people will start to move into the homes in mid to late April.  My Department is working with other Departments and agencies on the additional needs that will arise. We work closely with the Department of Health in relation to the healthcare needs of displaced people from Ukraine. The HSE has been notified of the proposed number of residents for each site and the associated potential healthcare needs. The Department of Education has put in place regional education and language teams, REALTs, to help Ukrainian families find schools. If the local school does not have enough places, alternative arrangements will be made to bring children to schools close by. In addition, funding from the €50 million community recognition fund in the Department of Rural and Community Development will be allocated to projects in the local area under the direction of Cavan County Council.

A briefing that we received from the Minister and his Department indicated that the rapid-build homes would be in place by the end of last year. Initially the number for Cavan was 60. This was reduced to 28, but that is still 28 additional families. I am concerned that as many hotels that are housing refugees at the moment may not continue to do so past the end of March, there will be more demand for accommodation. Given the level of demand in the housing market, what plans are being put in place to address that issue? In Cavan there is also considerable demand for preschool places. If children of preschool age arrive into the county, there will not be many places available for them. There is also high demand for secondary school places. I know of one school that already has 100 enrolments above its capacity for next year and that is just one school in the county. That is also happening in other schools, although the problem may reduce as students pick between different schools. Either way, with 28 additional families arriving, we need to ensure the children have school places.  I hear from local resource centres on a regular basis and they are also under pressure to provide services to the community at large and to the refugees that have come to live in the county from Syria and other places. They are lovely people who have integrated well but they need a lot more support.

They are there to identify where there is spare capacity, where schools are under pressure and to match that to the needs of Ukrainian children initially, but also of international protection children. That is a good system that is operating well. The REALTs will be closely linked in with the new arrivals in Cavan and other areas to make sure we can secure school places for them. In terms of the wider pressures, the Deputy is right that there is a risk that there will be greater pressures on the Ukrainian accommodation front going in to the spring. We have the modular accommodation approach, the new vacant homes scheme, and the refurbished home scheme that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is undertaking. We will have to examine the situation but a lot depends on how many hotels make a decision to revert to their former tourism use.

We need the Department of Education to assist and we need the Department of Health to ensure there are enough GPs to provide services. We have seen horrific protests outside accommodation centres, which should not be happening. If people want to protest, they should do so outside the gates of Leinster House and not outside the doors of places where vulnerable people are living. There are people out there with genuine concerns. We need to see a lot more co-operation across all Departments to ensure that the necessary services are put in place. In a past life I was a teacher. I taught students from many different parts of the world. Some of them came to Cavan as refugees. They brought a rich diversity to the classroom, they integrated well and we were able to accommodate them. There has been a huge increase in numbers since then and there must be a commensurate increase in resources to ensure there is the capacity to integrate them into our communities because that is the only way forward. School and education is a great way of doing that.

I have always been upfront in terms of the challenge that the dual crises of Ukrainian and wider migration poses. It is a challenge for the State. Indeed, it is a challenge for all states right now because it puts extra pressure on resources. The Deputy spoke about family resource centres and Tusla, through my Department, has been given an additional allocation to support the response to Ukraine. That can be filtered down to Tusla's front-line services, including family resource centres. I believe there is good intergovernmental co-operation. The Cabinet committee on Ukraine meets regularly and looks at these various issues. The Department of Education has done very good mapping to identify areas where there is capacity in schools and areas where there is not. Of course, when we are looking for accommodation it is not always possible to mirror that because if there is no hotel accommodation in an area where there is capacity, we are not able to immediately respond to that. We work as closely as we can with the Department of Education to try to align where we are locating Ukrainians with available capacity.

I send my sincere sympathies to Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae on the death of their uncle, Dinny Healy-Rae, a hard-working gentleman who left our shores for New Jersey 60 years ago. He was 90 years of age when he passed away yesterday. The question is short. What alternative accommodation does the Minister have in mind for the Ukrainian refugees in Killarney and Kerry, given that the tourist season is beckoning?

My Department is accommodating over 55,000 people from Ukraine, having contracted 42,000 beds in over 700 settings, including in serviced accommodation and other repurposed settings. In County Kerry, communities have welcomed over 6,000 Ukrainians, with almost 1,700 in the Killarney town area. I know that those from Ukraine sincerely appreciate the community support they have received across Kerry and the rest of the country.  Those fleeing Ukraine continue to arrive in Ireland and last week, there was an average of 124 arrivals daily. It remains challenging to provide shelter to all those in need and this is very much the focus across Government. My Department is in negotiations, as contracts expire, with all existing providers to ascertain whether they will continue to provide accommodation for Ukrainians. No provider has definitively indicated the intention to cease services under the new contracts the Department is offering. We will keep this under review and will continue to procure serviced and self-catering accommodation where we can. Although negotiations are ongoing, it is accepted that some providers will choose to revert to the tourism offering shortly and we are preparing for this. My Department is working urgently across Government with all partners to bring suitable alternative accommodation on board in all areas, including in County Kerry. The State is committed to delivering solutions beyond tourist accommodation and this includes progressing offers of refurbished buildings, the unoccupied homes campaign, pledged accommodation and rapid-build homes on suitable sites. My officials regularly meet representatives of Departments and Fáilte Ireland to discuss issues arising for those in the tourism market and how these can be responded to. The sector's continued support on this is really appreciated. Ukrainian displaced persons can make their own private arrangements and can avail of State supports to do so, including potentially availing of pledged or vacant accommodation. So far, 6,482 Ukrainians have been accommodated in 2,700 pledged properties around the country.

The situation in Kerry is very worrying. I have heard a lot about it on Radio Kerry and from Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and other Deputies. It is also very worrying in County Cork, where I come from. The tourism season is starting soon and we are trying to promote tourism and continue to do so. It is quite possible that hotels will want to cease their contractual involvement and it is not clear from the Minister's answer that steps have been taken to make sure that the Ukrainians who are in hotels will have alternative accommodation immediately.They cannot be left on the streets. If this accommodation ends, which is quite likely, we will have a two-tier situation here. If it does not, it will be detrimental to the tourism sector. The Minister might outline more clearly what will happen if this happens.

This is a war-generated crisis and it places a challenge on Ireland and on other countries. As I said, there are a number of clear programmes to provide additional accommodation - modular, refurbishment and the new vacant home scheme - but I am aware of the risk in that regard, particularly in the early part of spring. Those three strands may not accommodate everyone if a significant number of hotels decide to revert to tourism. In that case, we will have to work with local authorities on the standing up of rest centres, which have been hugely beneficial in terms of our response. We will also engage with the third level sector in terms of university accommodation. That was extremely beneficial last year. We will look at all options to make sure we can continue to accommodate all those who we are providing accommodation with at present.

He is talking about a huge number of people who have taken up stays in hotels because of the crisis that we are in. These are legitimate people. There are people coming into this country who are undocumented who, as far as I am concerned, should not be in this country. No one should be in this country unless he or she is fully documented. If I was leaving this country to go to another country, that is the way it would be for me, and in most cases it is. In this situation, unfortunately, there are tens of thousands of people who are undocumented here. The Government is starting to tighten up on it now but the horse has bolted. If contracts with the hotels end, they probably will not end with them all. I still do not see from the Minister's answers what exactly will be in place for these people if the hotels pull the contracts. As I said earlier, the tourism season is looming. Modular homes are not there. We are talking in a vacuum about homes that are not there at present and it is quite possible these contracts could end in the next few weeks.

If one were looking to flee one's country, if one were an Iranian feminist dissident or something like that, it is unlikely that the Iranian regime would give one an exit paper in which case one may have to flee the country on forged documents. That is an unfortunately consequence of the world we live in. People have a right to apply and there is a process. We all recognise the process for assessing someone's international protection application has to speed up. At the end of that process, there is a determination. Some people may be granted international protection and some will not. In the latter event, those people will be deported. However, that is the process that works. It is worth saying - I would have said this to Deputy Healy-Rae - I had a good meeting with the Kerry Community Response Forum with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and others, and I heard first hand the amazing work that is happening in Kerry in terms of welcoming both Ukrainians and international protection applicants. It was positive to see that real groundswell all over the county in terms of the support that is being given by community, voluntary and statutory groups.

They are being pushed out of their country and many of them are coming in our direction. What plans has the Department in place to be able to accommodate people? Is the Department proposing to continue with the rest centre model or what is the plan? There is also the issue with people being moved out of hotels. What will be the situation with people who are already here? I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide an outline on that.
#RodericOGorman	unknown-#RodericOGorman-party	unknown-#RodericOGorman-dob	unknown-#RodericOGorman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	117	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 67 and 78 together. The response to the ongoing migration crisis has entered a difficult phase with limited accommodation for international protection applicants available in the short-to-medium term, particularly for single adults. I can assure the Deputies that every effort is being made by my Department to address the current shortfall in accommodation. Since 1 December 2022 to 30 January 2023, more than 1,700 additional spaces have been brought into use by the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, for international protection applicants. To provide some context to this figure, the average annual number of people arriving in Ireland seeking international protection from 2017 to 2019 was 3,500. The arrival numbers are at an all time high with 15,000 people arriving in 2022. In the first month of 2023, more than 1,200 new international protection applicants have sought accommodation from the State. The Department has made every possible effort to secure accommodation and has sought support from the widest possible range of organisations to provide accommodation to international protection applicants. Where request for tender processes have not delivered the required capacity, the Department has engaged in emergency accommodation sourcing through networks with other State accommodation providers such as the local authorities, through newspaper advertisements, through cold calling and the use of online booking engines. The Department has reached out to other Departments such as the Department of Education for school and third level institution facilities, the Department of Defence for unused barracks and buildings, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media for sporting and arts facilities, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Office of Public Works for buildings that can be used to accommodate people. Many of the offers that have come through these requests have resulted in accommodation, both temporary and longer term. In 2022, the Department has utilised all manner of buildings offered to it including office buildings and sports facilities such as Páirc Uí Chaoimh and the National Indoor Arena, Abbotstown. The Department continues to evaluate all offers from providers who will accommodate international protection applicants. Last week, I wrote to ministerial colleagues seeking their assistance in sourcing buildings to facilitate emergency rest centre operations to address the increase in arrivals. Intensive efforts are being undertaken daily by my staff to source emergency accommodation. However, procuring enough bed space to keep pace with incoming arrivals remains extremely challenging, leading to a significant shortfall. The sourcing of accommodation for international protection applicants is becoming increasingly challenging, in particular for single males. The lead-in for international protection accommodation can at times be lengthy and complex, particularly with regard to appraisal and evaluation from a building control regulations and renovation timelines perspective and on negotiations and contract engagement. The Department, in co-operation with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, introduced a planning exemption for the change of use of office buildings and other warehouse-type facilities to assist in addressing the shortfall in international protection, IP, accommodation. Unfortunately, the take-up of this exemption by accommodation providers has been limited thus far. However, there is no delay from the Department in regard to its evaluation of offers and proposals are being appraised and agreed at a rapid pace. There is significantly more demand for accommodation on account of Ukrainian displaced persons requiring accommodation and the increasing number of protests adds another layer of complexity to providers offering their accommodation for international protection. In terms of measures being taken to increase capacity of accommodation for Ukrainian displaced persons, the Department continues to source shelter from multiple sources when it comes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. The Department is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders including accommodation providers, local authorities, Departments and implementing partners in efforts to secure new accommodation for Ukrainian displaced persons. As I said earlier, we are working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in terms of the rapid build housing programme, with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in terms of refurbished properties and on the Offer a Home campaign, and with accommodation providers through the new accommodation offer portal. We have engaged with sports bodies, religious institutions, etc. My Department continues to engage regularly with the City and County Management Association and the Local Government Management Association in terms of the provision of rest centres which has been important, particularly in meeting surges of arrivals of displaced persons from Ukraine. Notwithstanding the real and immediate challenges, my Department continues to work to secure accommodation for both international protection applicants and Ukrainian displaced persons.

There is quite a bit of information on it.Trying to predict how many spaces will be needed or how many people will be on the move fleeing the conflict is difficult, but the Minister undoubtedly has a good estimate of how many people are already in Ireland in, for example, hotel accommodation that would otherwise be being used for tourism. As such, he should have a good idea of what will happen with them in the weeks and months ahead as we approach the tourism season. We cannot pass these people from pillar to post. They need to know where they stand and what their situations will be in the months ahead. Knowing how the Government will accommodate them is important from their point of view but also from the point of view of tourism and so on. It is reasonable to assume that, as we move through spring towards the anniversary of the start of the war, there will be a surge in the conflict, which would drive more people into flight.

This was when the Government announced it had no more accommodation for international protection applicants. On top of that are the 5,000 people who have the right to leave direct provision but are still stuck in it because they have nowhere to go. It is baffling the Minister's party in particular made it a point of principle in designing the programme for Government to end direct provision and deal with these crises, but here we are slap bang in the middle of one. I wish to challenge what the Taoiseach said yesterday in answer to Deputies Pringle and Barry on Leaders' Questions. He repeated it on "Morning Ireland" today. He said that our telling the Government and previous Governments they had created a housing crisis over the past decade or more had led to the rise of the far right and the lack of accommodation for people who were seeking Ireland's protection. He said that we are giving them an out, but we are not. It is a fact that this Government has voted down every progressive means we have tried to introduce to end the housing crisis, which is at the root of the problem.

We need to consider all options. We know about the multidepartmental conversations that are happening in respect of accommodation. As Deputy Bríd Smith said, though, we are dealing with an accommodation crisis, and we need to get to the bottom of it first and foremost. In fairness, the Minister has always been available to answer specific queries. What interactions have there been between Departments? What is our ability to put a plan in place so that people are not left on the street? What sort of accommodation can we plan for and for what numbers? We have always said that the process needs to be streamlined, which I accept is happening in part.

We are looking to renew those through the new contract, which takes a bed-only approach to accommodation. To date, no provider has rejected the new contract and a significant number have signed up to it. This is positive in terms of our ability to maintain the existing level of capacity. We continue to engage and, as contracts come up for renewal, we will engage with more contractors to secure hotel and guest house accommodation. Deputy Bríd Smith raised a point about ending direct provision. We must recognise the changed landscape in terms of the numbers we are seeking to accommodate. The White Paper was introduced on the basis of 3,500 people coming through the system each year. Last year, 15,000 came through it. We must respond to the changed landscape. It is posing a unique challenge that would have been large on its own, but our need to accommodate 55,000 people coming from Ukraine adds to it. The Deputy knows from first-hand experience the difficulties in securing accommodation and the challenges encountered in having to respond to inaccurate, false or manipulated information, even in terms of securing accommodation for very short periods. We must try to put in place a larger system for accommodating migrants that can deal with more than 3,500 people per year. That will be a medium-to-long-term project. We also have an immediate need to secure accommodation right now. We are engaging with all Departments. For example, we have received support from the Department of Defence in the use of Kilbride barracks and, in the coming weeks, Mullingar barracks for international protection applicants. We are engaging with other Departments and Government agencies so that we can avoid people being left without accommodation. People are being left without accommodation, and that is not acceptable. We will continue working to end that situation.

Is it intended that the rest centres will follow a similar model? Will there be more rest centres? What does the Minister envisage being required in the event of more people fleeing? People in, for example, hotels would like to know where they stand. There needs to be communication with them. There also needs to be communication locally where other accommodation is being put in place. If there is no communication, there can often be an information gap that someone else will fill. It is important that there be credible sources of information so that people know what is happening.

There seems to be a refusal by every member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party to recognise that a large part of the accommodation problem has to do with the disgraceful housing crisis in which we have found ourselves. It is giving rise to decent people supporting far-right rhetoric because they have been ten, 12 or 15 years on the housing list and are confused about who gets what in this society. I do not blame them one bit for that. I blame nasty and hateful far-right leaders, but not ordinary people who are confused by the situation. I blame the Government for not recognising this factor. There are Government Deputies - not necessarily Green Party ones, but Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ones - talking about pull factors and problems with north African men. They need to shut up and deal with this situation decently through a true cross-party Government effort that examines the matter urgently. There are many ways to handle matters and the situation should not be handled in this slipshod way. There needs to be more urgency and co-ordination.

There are significant levels of disinformation as well as what one can only call at best "negative actors", the far-right, etc. A large amount of it cannot be called anything other than idiocy, but it is dangerous idiocy. We need to ensure there is no space for that. We also need to ensure that the outstanding issues relating to the payment of people providing accommodation is resolved. I would like details about another matter. If people are fleeing oppression, they have a right to apply for international protection, but the process has always been too long. What is being done to streamline it? We may need a wider conversation on the work visa system. I am like many Deputies. Most of the people contacting me work in the community helping those in international protection and temporary protection. We also need to consider dealing with the holiday home issue.

We must first meet the challenge of the number of people who are and have been homeless in our society. We must recognise that it is easy to blame the Government for everything. The Government did not start the war in Ukraine or in the various other countries from whence immigrants are coming at present. It is also important that we recognise that to shoehorn people in on top of society in inadequate accommodation is a recipe for disaster. We must ensure that at least basic requirements are met in such situations.

They are an extremely important part of our response and part of the contribution local authorities have made. There may be a greater call on local authorities for the use of rest centres, especially as we enter the summer, depending, as the Deputy said, on the numbers that continue to arrive. Numbers have been lower since Christmas but last week, for example, they increased again to 124 per day. The issue of communications is important. If we are moving Ukrainians from accommodation, we try to give them notice but there are times when moves have to take place rapidly. We do our best, but we need to signal to people that there may be times when we have to act quickly, especially if a contract falls through for a distinct reason. In response to Deputy Bríd Smith, throughout all my communications from the first day of the invasion and its resulting challenges, I have recognised we are responding to the war in Ukraine and an increase in migration in the context of a housing crisis in Ireland. I have never not recognised that we have a housing crisis. I have always been explicit that our accommodation response for Ukrainians and international protection applicants is different and separate from our response to the needs of people experiencing the housing crisis. There may be confusion about our response and about who gets what which is being taken advantage of, but I have always been clear that Ukrainians and international protection applicants do not get a position on the social housing list or access to HAP. They are provided with emergency accommodation. My Department has brought 75,000 beds of emergency accommodation on stream in the past year. That scale of emergency accommodation has never before been delivered in one year in this State. It is basic in many places but it provides shelter and security for individuals. I have always been clear that we have done so in the context of the wider response to the housing crisis. I know the Deputy will criticise our response to that but we are working in the same context. In response to Deputy Ó Murchú, there are issues related to payments. We are trying to reallocate staff to the payments unit. I accept some providers have experienced delays. We have paid out more than €500 million to date but I recognise there have been delays and we are looking at how to address them. The Deputy is also correct about the need to streamline and speed up the assessment of people's applications for international protection. One of the reasons direct provision became such a problem is that people were left in the system for so long. I recognise the work the Minister, Deputy McEntee, did and the Minister, Deputy Harris, is now doing to put additional resources in place to speed up that process in order for people to get their determinations earlier.

It is important to note that these refugees have been warmly welcomed and provided for in County Clare. Frustratingly, the high level of stakeholder engagement and boots-on-the-ground co-ordination we saw in March last year has all but disappeared and evaporated. The oversight and co-ordination from the Minister's Department in towns such as Ennistymon and Shannon is utterly insufficient at this time. I ask the Minister for an update on new accommodation the Minister's Department and the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, are procuring in County Clare. Not all of the 75,000 beds are quality beds. Some 86 of them in my home village are in tents. We need a decision today about whether that will continue. Will we keep people in tents?

The arrival of more than 70,000 people seeking accommodation in Ireland, displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine - the largest displacement of people in Europe since the Second World War - and those seeking international protection has placed severe pressure on the State to respond to this challenge. As of 29 January 2023,19,635 people are accommodated in the international protection system as a whole, compared with 7,500 in late 2021. Emergency centres have been opened in all parts of the country. Approximately 60 accommodation locations across 17 counties have been utilised since January 2022. In regard to international protection applicants, all the limited accommodation capacity in the IPAS is currently being used. In this context, the Department has no option but to consider all offers of accommodation made to it, including the use of office buildings and sports facilities, to address the accommodation shortfall. While offers of accommodation received from locations in Clare will continue to be appraised, my Department is working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, to develop a proposal to use a State-owned property in Shannon, Unit 153 of the Shannon Free Zone, for IPAS accommodation. Engagement is ongoing. It is not possible to provide final details prior to designs being decided and a facilities provider is contracted to operate the facility. It is anticipated that the property will come online later this year. The OPW confirmed on 30 January that the fire officer had reviewed the proposals for Unit 153 and was satisfied the design meets fire safety requirements. The OPW awaits a final formal approval from the fire officer but is confident that the layouts shown are acceptable. The OPW does not envisage any problems and is progressing on this basis in order to expedite the project. The International Protection Procurement Services, IPPS, advised the OPW it is satisfied with the proposed design. The next step is for the OPW to move to detailed design and request a contractor to price the works. The OPW will review the price proposal and if it is fair and reasonable will progress the project with the current contractor. If the price is regarded as excessive the detailed design will be issued to the other framework members to price. The design team met again on 2 February and were asked when it expects to be in a position to give indicative timescales for the delivery of detailed designs, costings and a start date for occupancy. The OPW has been requested to revert with this information to the IPPS as soon as possible.

I asked a parliamentary question because I did not know anything about it. In early January I received a reply from the Minister stating it was commercially sensitive. There was not a scintilla of information after that. I am now getting a litany of information. It is not good enough. That information vacuum has led many people to ask legitimate questions in the town, but it has also been exploited by the far right. An unsavoury character showed up in the town last week from Dublin. He is known nationally for his activities in the far right realm. It is unforgivable. I was on Drivetime radio two weeks ago, again with no information to hand. Sarah McInerney and John Cooke confirmed to me in the course of the interview that this was happening. I am a colleague of the Minister in the Government. I have an elected mandate in Clare and I am unable to give people information. Stakeholder engagement is needed. The Minister needs to consult with people on the ground. He must speak with the six school principals who are already struggling with an enrolment crisis for September 2023 and have not heard a squeak from the Department. Communication is needed in order to make this a success. The people are welcome, but this can only be done successfully through engagement.

I wrote to the Minister three weeks ago to advise him that a number of constituents had contacted me around this proposal. I will provide some background. This ended up in The Clare Champion about three and a half or four weeks ago. It referred to Unit 153. People were not informed. There was a lack of information, as my constituency colleague said, and a vacuum was created. I will be blunt. It seems the situation has been mishandled. I recognise the changed landscape but I am specifically interested in the response. The Minister's refusal to engage has created apathy but also, as has been said, a vacuum has been created and we do not want that to be replicated in County Clare.I reiterate the call in my letter for the Minister to hold a public meeting in Shannon, engage with the community and hear the concerns and issues they have.

As I said in an earlier reply, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has put in place a statutory instrument which allows for the conversion of office and other buildings to international protection accommodation, recognising the particularly difficult challenges we face with accommodating Ukrainian and international protection applicants right now. That is being applied in this situation, and this is why there is a change of use of that building. This is not like other situations where my Department is procuring accommodation directly. Rather, we are working with another State agency, namely, the Office of Public Works, OPW. There are a number of commercial elements to its engagement with our contractors. There is nothing more infuriating for any Deputy than being told commercial concerns bar the answer to a question. I know that is frustrating. It is frustrating for me in terms of being able to get accurate information out to people. However, significant work is going on with this building and we need to allow that work to take place before we understand its potential for occupancy in terms of whether it will be a building for family groups. As such, that will have knock-on impact on the need for schools in the area. As I said earlier, we now have processes to examine where new accommodation is coming online to make sure we can link children living in that accommodation to schools, either locally or, if there is pressure on local schools, schools within a wider area. That is the regional education and language teams, REALT, system the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, has set up. The system was initially for Ukrainians and now includes international protection applicants. I have heard what Deputies have said. I recognise there has been an information vacuum which has created challenges for Deputies in ensuring the welcome they both spoke of which the people of Shannon will give to those fleeing war is fully maintained and there is no exploitation by malicious actors.

I and other politicians in the county have been left firefighting. We are trying to give accurate information to people who have genuine concerns. Beyond that, there is huge exploitation coming from the far right. The Minister needs to give us information. I cannot fathom why he could not give me, as a colleague in government, information in the House three weeks ago, yet his office was able to brief RTÉ's "Drivetime". That is not the way things should work in a coalition Government. I want to reference the town of Lisdoonvarna, County Clare. This time last year it had a population of 400 people and now has a population of close to 1,500, an almost fourfold increase in population. It has welcomed every single Ukrainian and international protection refugee. The people there have done an incredible job welcoming refugees, but there are no longer boots on the ground. At one point, a class was being taught in a cloakroom. There is no GP care. There is lack of everything and no co-ordination. We need the Minister and his officials to be on the ground. They were everywhere last March. They marched up and down the street with ambassadors. There were photo opportunities and a fanfare. There is now nothing. The town is pleading for support and help from Government. The town will play its part but it wants the Government to step up as well.

Other elements of the building code, such as fire certification and building management controls, continue to apply. A building such as this cannot be used until appropriately certified. I do not have the financial details for the Deputy. They are coming, and as soon as I am in a position to do so, I will make them available to Deputies. That is why I was not able to give more information to Deputy Crowe earlier. I accept what he said about that limiting his ability and that of other Deputies to get the correct information out. There is a challenge, in particular when these projects are undertaken across a number of Departments, in that there can be more red tape and barriers to a free flow of information than when things are done through my Department alone. I am appreciative when we do joint projects. I am appreciative of the support given by the OPW and the Department of Defence in bringing forward accommodation. It is indicative of the very real pressure we are under and the fact that people are being left without accommodation, as Deputy Smith spoke to earlier, that we have had to move in this very rapid fashion in a number of areas. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, are bringing forward a community recognition fund to recognise those parts of the country that have taken on significant numbers of refugees. County Clare has taken in a number of Ukrainian and international protection applicants. I understand about €2.9 million of the fund will be allocated to Clare to support projects that will be a long-term recognition of the huge efforts the county has made to address and support the needs of people arriving there.

We have a duty to protect all children.

If I or my officials become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. The Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on specific groups of professionals and particular organisations providing services to children. The Children First guidance 2017 includes information on the statutory obligations for those individuals and organisations under Act. It also sets out the best practice procedures that should be in place for all organisations providing services to children. Under the Act, mandated persons are required to report child protection concerns at or above a defined threshold to Tusla. Mandated persons are people who have contact with children and families and who, because of their qualifications, training or employment role, are in a key position to help protect children from harm. Organisations classed as providers of relevant services under the Act are required to undertake a risk assessment and develop a child safeguarding statement setting out the procedures in place to manage any risk identified. The Children First Act operates side by side with the non-statutory obligation provided for in Children First, the national guidance for the protection and welfare of children. The guidance sets out how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the public and professionals to Tusla and what organisations need to do to keep children safe. If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report concerns about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on its website. If a child is at immediate risk or danger, An Garda Síochána should be alerted without delay Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child.Children who are at immediate risk may be dealt with initially by An Garda Síochána or Tusla but, in the main, both agencies work together on such cases. Tusla has an out-of-hours emergency number that provides advice to An Garda Síochána based on the circumstances and can identify where a child is listed on the child protection notification system. A 24-7 out-of-hours social work team is available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork, and on-call social workers are available in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.

Their children have been removed not because they had bad mothers or bad homes but for other reasons. These mothers are victims of referrals to the system and numerous hearings where attention is not brought to the concerns they brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities and their children are alienated from them. We do not seem to be able to come to grips with it. Will the Minister recognise this problem exists and that Tusla has an obligation to protect children? The Children First legislation is there for that purpose but it does not always apply.

The protection of children is the primary obligation on Tusla. By and large, the removal of children from their families is a last resort and is undertaken in situations where the social worker or indeed An Garda Síochána feel there is a significant risk to the child and they have to intervene. Where that takes place, the response is as much as is possible to place a child with a foster family to ensure he or she is in as natural a family atmosphere as possible. A total of 90% of children in care in this country are in foster care, which is a much higher percentage than many other countries. I recognise that where a child has been taken away from their family and particularly their mother, it creates incredible hardship for that family. We are looking at whether there are ways in which we can provide better advocacy and supports to parents, recognising that advocacy systems are in place for children in the care system. It is also important to recognise the needs of parents who have had children taken away from them.

It is used as a first resort in a situation that is prevalent in this country and which I believe is alien to everything we stand for. I would like some investigation to be carried out in the shortest period of time into the number of such cases. Mothers have a legitimate claim that their case is not being heard adequately.

I know he has advocated on this issue. He understands that, as Minister, I am unable to involve myself directly in a case before the court due to the statutory independence of the Child and Family Agency. Regarding whether there is a category of cases or we are just dealing with one or two, the Deputy seems to suggest there are a wider range of cases so I am happy to talk to him afterwards about this to get a better understanding of what we are trying to categorise. I have strong confidence in Tusla, notwithstanding the fact that not every social worker makes the right call every time. By and large, the right practices and policies are in place in Tusla to ensure we have a very consistent approach regarding taking a child away from a family. I am happy to discuss this directly with the Deputy.

What are the responsibilities of the newly appointed Minister of State with special responsibility for integration?

The Government commits to publishing a national action plan against racism for Ireland. An independent anti-racism committee established by Government in 2020 has created a draft action plan against racism supported in its work by the Department. We plan to launch that plan next month. The Government is committed to developing a successor to the migrant integration strategy and planning is under way. Consultation for the new strategy will begin shortly and will include input from migrants, Irish citizens with a migrant background, international protection applicants and refugees. The strategy is expected to be published in 2024. In 2022, the EU agreed to extend the asylum, migration and integration fund, AMIF, 2014 to 2020 programme in response to the refugee crisis arising from the conflict in Ukraine. A call for proposals for projects under AMIF is planned in 2023. The exact budget is to be determined. As committed to under the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service, a new international protection integration fund was launched in 2022. This fund offered grants to civil society organisations for projects supporting the integration of international protection applicants. More than €1.6 million in funding was awarded to 67 organisations in 2022. A second fund will be launched later in 2023. Regarding community engagement and integration capacity building, I am acutely aware from today's proceedings and wider news that communities are anxious to have as much information as possible if and when an accommodation facility is due to come to their area. I understand this need and can confirm that a process has started in the Department of the Taoiseach whereby officials in my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development are engaging to see how relevant Departments can assist in strengthening the community engagement function.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
Since its establishment in 2015, the Department's Irish refugee resettlement programme has worked with local authorities and communities to house and provide integration support to approximately 4,100 programme refugees resettled throughout Ireland.

Has there been an acknowledgement by the Government that this Department needs to be improved? There was talk in some of the earlier engagements of the cross-government approach. We have heard about pressures on GP care. Are there any plans to expand Sláintecare? Are there any plans for the HSE to employ GPs directly in areas where GPs say they are under pressure? Are there any plans to increase the number of medical cards? Has the Minister of State spoken to other Departments about that? There have been complaints that some people are getting medical cards while other people, including those with cancer, are waiting. That is causing frustration. The Minister of State mentioned the consultation process. I remember how, when the Skellig Star incident happened, a person was directly appointed by the Department of Justice to liaise with local representatives and local communities. Does the Minister of State plan to put someone like that back in place?

In combination with the process within the Department of the Taoiseach, I am already drawing on my role in the Department of Rural and Community Development to use local networks that already exist and that will be very important to the integration and community engagement process. I am in three Departments at the moment. I am not in the Department of Health. I am aware of the GP issue. Last year, as part of my role in the Department of Rural and Community Development, I visited Kerry and the community response forums where the issue of GP access was raised. In turn, I raised this with the Minister for Health ahead of the budgetary process last year.My understanding is there were increased budgetary allocations in that regard. The community recognition fund comprises €50 million, a substantial sum, to be spread over two years. We want to see substantial projects that will have a long-lasting impact, with €30 million allocated for this year and €20 million for next year.

We are seeing the rise of the far right and we do not want what happened in the Netherlands and Sweden to happen here. Should some Minister or Minister of State have sole responsibility for this such that it would be his or her one job to deal with integration? Perhaps the Minister of State is spreading himself too thin in dealing with all the other issues. I note he took questions in the House regarding social protection earlier. He did not mention anything about accommodation. What efforts are being made with regard to holiday homes? The White Paper mentioned six reception centres that would deal with people during their first four months in the country. Should this role be tied in with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service rather than having two separate Departments deal with people who make applications to be accommodated?

There is great value to me being in the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Social Protection as well as the Department we are discussing, and that was the thinking behind bringing me to this Department. I also bring the community sector links to this Department. We have all seen at a grassroots level communities responding throughout last year and more recently to the challenges they face. It is very much my intention to bring that value, experience and connections to this role as well, and that has started. Kerry has been allocated €4.4 million under the community recognition fund. The Deputy mentioned holiday homes. A stream of work is happening to assist us in the challenges we face under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The vacant homes scheme has brought 800 properties on stream, which is an important assistance to mention from that Department.

Affordable, accessible, high-quality and sustainable early learning and childcare, ELC, is a key priority for the Government. I have taken numerous actions to support the sustainability of all services, including the introduction of supply-side funding through core funding, as well as the continued increase in investment in the sector, with expenditure to exceed €1 billion by 2023. Core funding, with a budget of €259 million in its first year, significantly increases income for the overwhelming majority of services and provides greater funding stability to the sector. I am delighted that 4,196 services currently have an active core funding contract, representing 94% of the sector. Applications for the scheme remain open. The latest available information shows closures of eight services that have activated a core funding contract since the scheme began on 15 September. Three of these services self-reported their reason for closure as financial. Additional data from Tusla on ELC closures and new service registrations in 2022 showed that the number of net closures was lower in 2022 than in previous years. In 2022, 141 ELC closures were notified to Tusla, with 83 new service registrations, or 58 net closures. This compares with 76 net closures in 2021, 106 in 2020 and 103 in 2019. There is considerable diversity among the reasons given for closure by providers. While some services have closed for financial reasons such as reduced demand, many have closed for other reasons such as the retirement of the owner and manager. I have been unequivocal in saying I do not want any services to be faced with financial sustainability issues and I am fully committed to working with all services to support them in delivering early learning and childcare for the public good. While core funding has significantly increased income for the overwhelming majority of services, a number of measures have been put in place to ensure all services are sufficiently supported in the transition to this new funding model. A funding guarantee has issued to services that may see a small reduction in income due to changes to the funding approach from last year. That affects 60 services that have had their core funding topped up to match last year's higher capitation and programme support payment. Additionally, I have initiated an independent financial review of sessional services to provide greater insight and evidence that may underpin development to core funding in year 2. This independent review will involve an in-depth examination of participants' financial circumstances through the provision of detailed information on income and expenditure and an analysis of the impact of the early learning and childcare funding streams. Expressions of interest are live to seek participation in the services. In budget 2023, I secured an overall increase in the allocation for year 2 of core funding to €287 million.

I will outline them in a staccato manner but he might respond to each of them. They relate to: the extension of the access and inclusion model, AIM, beyond the early childhood care and education, ECCE, area, to which it is currently confined; the confusion of the huge number of inspectorates that call at the doors of childcare providers; and the anomalies in some of the staffing ratios whereby ratios much lower than those in childhood education are demanded in some parts, even for after-school service and care. Where stands the Minister's proposal to introduce a childcare development authority that would see this sector as one we have to drive on a long-term, sustainable basis with mixed providers?

As the Deputy will be aware, there was a Government decision in 2021 to proceed on that and consider the impact on various other settings in the sector. That is a big change and we are undertaking the groundwork with the various existing parts of the sector. A unit in my Department is focused on that project. I would very much like to broaden out AIM past the two years of ECCE. AIM has been a very good programme. Obviously, there would be a financial impact, and I will look for the Deputy's support in ensuring we can achieve it. That, and the new strand of supporting the disadvantaged within early years, are two key matters I would like to advance in next year's Estimates. As for staffing ratios, it is appropriate for babies and young children that there are high levels of staffing ratios. For the ECCE programme, it is 1:11. I do not think they are excessive in light of the young age of many of the charges.

Even for after-school care, which does not involve infants, the ratios are very low, at 12:1, which seems quite stringent compared with ratios in our schools. The issue of multiple inspections is a source of irritation. There are the HSE, Pobal, the Department of Education and Tusla. There are a range of inspectors, which puts pressure on what are sometimes very small operations.

Given we are dealing with our most vulnerable and youngest citizens, it is appropriate our standards are high and inspected. Nevertheless, it is an issue I hear about in my constituency from childcare providers. In the context of the work we are doing to look at the overall architecture of the sector and the idea of a childcare agency, there is the opportunity to consider issues such as the multiplicity of inspection points rather than the standards themselves and to see whether any condensing can be done that would maintain standards but also remove some of the burden from childcare providers.

Éireoidh sé níos measa sna míonna atá amach romhainn de réir mar a mhéadaíonn rátaí trasna an bhoird agus de réir mar a bhíonn oibrithe agus teaghlaigh ag déileáil leis an ngéarchéim costais maireachtála. Tá tacaíocht agus faoiseamh morgáiste de dhíth orthu. For homeowners, the cost-of-living crisis has opened up a new front, as mortgage-interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank, ECB, increased its key interest rate which took effect yesterday and a further hike expected is next month. As we know, retail banks have not yet passed on ECB rate hikes in full, but it is widely expected that rates will rise significantly across the board in the coming months. For others, the impact has been immediate and severe. The tens of thousands of homeowners who had their mortgages sold off to vulture funds were time and again given assurances by Government Ministers that they had nothing to worry about. The Taoiseach told them they would be no worse off while the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform went so far as to say that he would be happy for his own mortgage to be sold off to a vulture fund. These assurances were naïve in the extreme back then and they have proven to be completely false. My party and I warned of this years ago. Now the tens of thousands of borrowers whose loans are held by vulture funds are now at the sharp edge of these interest rate hikes. Many of them are facing interest rates as high as 7.5%. They are paying as much as €400 more per month in interest than they would be paying had their mortgages not been sold off. They have no option to switch or to fix their rate. They describe themselves as mortgage prisoners with nowhere to turn. One homeowner contacted me whose mortgage was sold by Permanent TSB to Start Mortgages. She is a full-time carer for her son, who has cerebral palsy. By January she had received four letters each informing her of a further rate increase. She will be paying over €4,000 in additional interest this year, with further hikes down the line, with the hike that took effect yesterday and the one that is planned for March. She said that hikes across the board are barely sustainable, but to have the constant fear every month of the next increase coming and how to finance the previous month's increase, is inhumane. Many households face this reality. They have received as many as five letters through the door and will receive a sixth next month, when the ECB hikes its rates again. As banks increase their interest rates in the coming months, thousands more households will face higher mortgage costs. For many this is breaking point. Being able to pay the mortgage is just as important as being able to pay the rent or the energy bill. The alternatives are just as serious: arrears, increased debt and financial hardship. Sinn Féin has called on the Government to introduce targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief to support homeowners who are and will face spiralling interest and mortgage costs. The Minister for Finance has rejected this proposal; he is wrong to do so. Fianna Fáil campaigned in the 2016 general election to extend mortgage interest relief when rates for many were half what they are now for those whose mortgages are in the hands of the vultures. So I am asking, will the Government introduce targeted and temporary mortgage interest relief to support these homeowners who are now paying up to 7.5% interest into the hands of vulture funds and will be paying 8% when the ECB increases its interest rate within four weeks?

The Deputy knows that the formulation of monetary policy is an independent matter for the European Central Bank. We are acutely aware that the ECB has hiked its key interest rates by 3% since last July to fight inflation. That is why it is being done. We expect two further rate increases. It is up to each individual lender to decide on whether to pass on those increases. The Government has no role in setting retail interest rates, as the Deputy also knows. That is solely a commercial matter for the individual lenders. It is also important to note that the average interest rate on new mortgages in Ireland was 2.69% in December and the average rate for mortgages in the eurozone was just short of 3%. We have one of the lowest new variable rates in Europe. That has been a significant change over recent years. At the finance committee last month, representatives from the Central Bank reiterated that regulated lenders including banks and non-banks have very clear obligations under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Central Banks supervisory regime to have supports, resources and options available for any borrower who feels they may be challenged in meeting their mortgage repayments. In November 2022 the Central Bank wrote to lenders to emphasise the onus on them to review their product lines and suites of options to make sure they remain fit for purpose. In the case of credit, that means making sure the loans remain affordable. Thankfully, we have seen a continued reduction in long-standing mortgage arrears where rates have fallen quite substantially in the last number of years. The banks' supervisory regime focuses on affordability and kicks in not just when a person falls into arrears but when a person is facing arrears. It is more extensive, detailed and intrusive than in any other European jurisdiction. The Central Bank said last week that the area on which it is most focused is the one which Deputy Doherty has raised, namely the 38,000 borrowers who are on high interest rates with the non-bank lenders who do not have a full suite of options available to them. Many cannot switch into fixed rates. Many can and are not aware that they can if their loan is a performing loan now. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, met the Governor of the Central Bank this week and asked the regulator if it needs more legal powers to assist such mortgage holders. That is being worked on right now. Borrowers facing financial difficulty should engage with lenders as early as possible as a way of addressing the issues. Borrowers can appeal any decision to the Financial Services Ombudsman. On specific tax measures, the Deputy knows that tax decisions are made in a co-ordinated way through the annual budget process which generally follows the establishment of a pathway taking into account the national economic dialogue, the summer economic statement and the tax strategy group deliberations. Mortgage interest relief cost the Exchequer more than €700 million a year if you go back to 2008, which was the final year before the gradual phasing out of mortgage-interest relief. Sinn Féin's proposals to reintroduce mortgage-interest relief would be of no benefit to fixed-rate mortgages yet the average outstanding balance as of June 2022 on tracker mortgages is about €107,000 whereas the corresponding figure for fixed-rate mortgages is just short of €175,000. Moreover the average new mortgage draw-down in the third quarter of 2022 was €284,000. Thankfully, the vast majority of new mortgages in Ireland now, over 90%, are on a fixed-rate basis. There are issues with the non-bank lenders and the Minister for Finance has been working with the Governor of the Central Bank about strengthening its code and asking the Central Bank what additional powers it would require to help in the area.

How naive was that? How false a promise was that? These individuals are paying thousands and thousands of euro more as a result of their mortgages being sold to a vulture fund. I gave the example of Rachel. She is paying €4,000 in interest more than she was paying this time last year. That is a serious amount of money and it is before this month's interest-rate hike kicks in or that of next month. The Government handed them over to the vultures and the vultures are preying on them now. They are being charged 7.5% interest and it will go up next month to 8%. The Minister says it is over to the Central Bank. We know the limitations of the Central Bank. These vulture funds, in the main, are not offering fixed rates or reduced rates. Their offer to customers is one of "pay your mortgage or we come after you". There is a solution here. It is not to take away all of the pain but about reintroducing mortgage-interest relief in a targeted and tailored way.That is not the way it introduced it in the past, which covered all interests, but to cover the increased interest since June of last year. Does the Minister not consider it appropriate that people paying over €5,000 more in interest should have a measure introduced to help them in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis?

The Deputy neglected to mention the cost-of-living measures we brought forward in the last budget, which was the most significant package of measures brought forward and more than even the Deputy’s party looked for. Sinn Féin's targeted measure, as far as we can discern, would affect about 716,000 mortgages. That party has not provided costings to us, though it was asked for them. We estimate that approach would cost about €655 million. It has to make choices within that.

I acknowledge the presence at the funeral of not only the President but also a representative of the Taoiseach; the Minister, Deputy Foley; the Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill; and Deputy Devlin. I express on my behalf and that of the Labour Party our appreciation for that and we send our sincere thoughts, condolences and sympathies to Tom, Cliodhna, Macdara and all of Niamh’s friends and wider community. She has left a tremendous legacy and while we will have the opportunity to speak further on that at another date, I wanted to acknowledge it today. In the past 24 hours, my office has heard from several individuals who have languished on the housing list for years wondering when, if ever, they will have somewhere to call home. We have heard from a constituent facing an imminent and illegal eviction who cannot get a response from the Residential Tenancies Board, from an employee forced to commute six hours per day from Mayo to Dublin due to the lack of affordable housing here and from a homelessness case worker who is re-evaluating their career due to burnout.  The Government’s over-reliance on the private sector for the supply of housing is a strategy that is failing all those people who have contacted me and is failing people across the country. In six years, Dublin City Council has spent €220 million buying back former local authority homes, according to Sharon McGowan’s report for The Times. The State funnels close to €1 billion into the pockets of private landlords each year through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other rent subsidy schemes. That is a stark example of what we can call the sunk cost fallacy, this Government’s addiction to doling out public money to the private sector at the expense of spending that money on investment in State-built and State-owned housing. Why are we continuing to spend so much money subsidising private sector provision instead of building public housing on public land? Week in and week out, we hear the same narrative with different figures and new initiatives from the Government. The reality is that none of those initiatives have delivered for the people who have contacted my office or who are contacting all of us all the time.  This week’s Housing for All progress report makes for depressing reading because its promises and aspirations jar with the reality of those contacting my office, and jar with repeated calls from organisations like Focus Ireland and Threshold and from front-line workers. We have seen seven years of strong economic growth wasted, when we should have seen investment in housing provision. The problem has got worse. This evening the Dáil will debate a Labour Party motion to introduce real, substantial measures to deliver on housing, including an emergency public house-building programme, the extension of the eviction ban to the end of the year and the strengthening of the tenant in situ scheme. We ask for fast-tracking of our constructive legislative proposals: our homeless families Bill, our renters’ rights Bill and our Kenny report Bill. All of those, if adopted and enacted by the Government, could and would make a real difference in addressing the housing crisis.

I had the pleasure of meeting her on a couple of occasions. She was a fine person who leaves a strong legacy in education and will be sorely missed. I thank the Deputy for her kind remarks on the attendance from Government. There will be an appropriate time to pay tributes to an outstanding Minister for Education. I ask the Deputy to please pass on the Government’s deepest sympathies to the family and to colleagues in the Labour Party. On housing, we are acutely aware of the scale of the challenge the Government and country face in relation to increasing housing provision across the board in all tenures. We are not reliant on the private sector. The Deputy made one point which I think is wholly incorrect. I say this respectfully. She talks of €1 billion being funnelled into the pockets of private landlords. That is €1 billion that supports 60,000 tenancies, real families on housing assistance payments. People who continue to make the charge that it is a subsidy or cash bonus for private landlords are wholly incorrect. It supports 60,00 households in this country. We have seen over the past three years a reduction in the increase in HAP. We are seeing people transfer out of HAP. How do we do that? We need to build more public homes and more affordable homes. If the Deputy saw the recently published progress report for Housing for All, she will also have seen that last year, under Housing for All, we far exceeded our target for overall delivery. Just short of 30,000 new homes were build. We will deliver more new-built social homes in 2022 then we have done in 50 years, since 1975. Those figures will be published shortly. We have provided cost rental for the first time ever to hundreds of tenancies and want to do thousands. That is State-backed affordable rental at below-market price. I have met many of the tenants who have moved in. It is a very popular new form of tenure. There is affordable purchase for the first time in 15 years led by local authorities. I have approved 42 schemes with 2,800 new homes across 15 counties. The first home scheme has seen over 900 approvals already, which is 900 new homes that families are able to buy. Many of them were renting and stuck in a rental trap. We have bridged the viability and affordability gap for them. The measures we have taken are taking hold. Housing for All has been in place for only one year and there is much more to do in that space. We want to build more social homes and affordable homes this year, and will do so.

We appreciate that very much. We seek to be constructive in addressing the housing crisis and to put forward positive proposals for change that would deliver on housing. That is the purpose of our motion this evening and we were disappointed last night to see Government put down an amendment to that motion. We ask it to withdraw the amendment and work with us and all in opposition who seek to be constructive in this regard. I accept the €900 million in rent subsidies is essential to keep families and households out of homelessness but it illustrates the short-sightedness of Government housing policy over the past seven years that that level of financing is not seen instead in the provision of public housing on public land, which would be an investment for the State and have a longer-term impact on keeping families and individuals out of homelessness. Will the Minister address the fact that the number of people entering homelessness reached a record high of 11,632 in December? No matter what figures are given and what initiatives are announced, the housing policy is not working and we need to see innovative and constructive ways to address that. We seek to help the Government in doing that.

It was originally conceived in the 1990s when the then Minister, Martin Cullen, launched a design competition for the north wharf. It is marvellous to see the contractor finally appointed and hard hats and white vans arriving to the site. It took a massive and sustained effort to bring this project to fruition. That effort included predecessors of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, namely, the former Minister, Martin Cullen, and former Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, as well as the steadfast stewardship of Waterford City and County Council under Mr. Michael Walsh. I also acknowledge the Minister and his Department's front-bench engagement with me on the project. The Minister has cut the Gordian knot and made it happen. By his action, he has gone some way to restoring the hope of Waterford for better times ahead. I also look forward to the opening of the new Irish wake museum in the heart of Waterford's Viking Triangle. I again acknowledge the support of the Minister's Department to Waterford and to me in the delivery of this further outstanding historical project to the city's impressive tourism offering. That said, the rose is not without its thorns. The Minister's Department has let Waterford down with regard to student accommodation. The national student accommodation strategy, which began in 2016 and will run for another two years, is a shared policy between the Minister's Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. Remarkably, despite all the big talk about expanding Waterford's university - big all-action talk that was in the last three programmes for Government - the Minister's plan provides for no additional student accommodation in Waterford; not a single bed more than the 2,500 or so units that have been in the city now for 20 years, many of which were developed by the old Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, all the while providing for expansion of student accommodation in every other university city in Ireland, which the Minister's Department is doing. I gather this plan is the reason why the Waterford Crystal site has not been acquired to date despite the Taoiseach stating in this House that it was the Government's intention to acquire that site more than two years ago. I am also given to understand it is why the LDA and other streams of public funding cannot be accessed to support student accommodation being developed in Waterford. Will the Minister build on the momentum of the north quays and commit to revising the national student accommodation strategy to put ambitious targets in place for Waterford? Without ending this discrimination, it appears we cannot unlock and unleash the significant development potential of our region.

Specifically in relation to the North Quays project, I had the pleasure of visiting the city of Waterford on a number of occasions. The overall Exchequer commitment to Waterford on that project alone is approximately €170 million. Overall, it is approximately €200 million when the contribution from Waterford City and County Council is taken into account. I agree with the Deputy and share his words of commendation to Mr. Michael Walsh and his team in Waterford. It is an extremely progressive local authority that is doing fantastic work. The North Quays project will be transformative. It is a fantastic city and a great county with massive potential. This Government is committed to Waterford. I know the Deputy is likewise, as is my good colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, Deputy Ó Cathasaigh and many others who advocate so strongly for development in Waterford. It is great to see the North Quays contracts being signed and contractors in place. I intend to visit on 6 March to see the work in progress. That will unlock so much within the city and will also be able to provide more homes in that area. With regard to student accommodation, the Deputy will know that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, in November received Government approval and support on outline proposals to increase the supply of student accommodation. Waterford will not be left out. The Minister last week met the chair of South East Technological University, SETU, to discuss its plans to develop additional accommodation. Those discussions are ongoing. It is the only technological university, TU, in the country that has student accommodation and it needs more. With regard to the expansion of the campus, that is still a Government commitment. Discussions are ongoing with regard to a number of options but, specifically, the Waterford Crystal site. That is something on which the Minister, Deputy Harris, is working with Government and Government colleagues. The provision of student accommodation is so important right across the country. Many students are renting homes when they would rather be on campus in affordable student accommodation. Those homes will also be freed up when we provide more student accommodation. I commend the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the work he has done in that space. We have already been able to activate a number of paused planning permissions for student accommodation because of the initiatives brought forward by this Government to provide hundreds more student beds on campus this year at an affordable price. We want to do thousands more for students themselves, for their education and their experience in third-level and fourth-level education. Many wish to live on or close to campus in purpose-built student accommodation and we are committed to doing that. We are the first Government that brought forward a specific plan in that space. I will relay the points made by the Deputy directly to the Minister, Deputy Harris. However, the plans for expansion of the university campus are still in train and are being worked on.

I have raised the issue of borrowing and the national student accommodation strategy a number of times, however. Despite WIT and now SETU having a track record as being the only TU in the country delivering student accommodation, it has been roundly hobbled by the Department's national strategy; so much so, in fact, that funders can see that the student accommodation in Waterford has zero Government support at this point. How can we build a functioning university in the south east if we cannot accommodate our students? This Government has been in office now for two and a half years and we have been told continually about all the great things that are going to happen for our university. I met representatives of the Department within the past ten days. No borrowing framework has been agreed. No-one is carrying hods on a site on Waterford and there are no cranes or boots on the ground. Planning permission has not even yet been secured. There are no prizes for plans. Delivered actions are what we need to see. I ask that this be actioned now.

The most significant investment in the region is through the urban regeneration and development fund. People can see the colour of our money in that space and that we made good on our commitments. As I said, the Minister, Deputy Harris, met the chair of the university last week and discussions are ongoing. Those discussions were specifically around plans to develop additional student accommodation. This Government, in our programme for Government but also in Housing for All, made a commitment to allow the technological universities to borrow and we are doing that. The borrowing frameworks are being put in place. That is a big change. We have an opportunity now to provide purpose-built affordable student accommodation in our technological universities right across the country. I can assure the Deputy that Waterford will not be left out. Those discussions are detailed and ongoing. We will keep the Deputy apprised of the progress. I thank him for his support in that regard.

I put the question now to the Minister as to why that is. Am I correct in saying that Uisce Éireann, formerly Irish Water, was commissioned as a provider of safe, clean and affordable water and wastewater services for all water users? Water and wastewater services were previously provided by the local authorities. It was designed as a stand-alone national authority for water services. Why is this not happening? We are now ready to start building in our towns and villages for our local people and local economies. The Minister appeared on a video a couple of months ago with Councillor Kevin Sheahan. People have been looking for a treatment system in Askeaton for 37 years. That was promised by all the Ministers outside of this Government and by this Government. It has been 37 years. The Government promised this when I sat on the Adare-Rathkeale council and has yet to deliver it. It just keeps saying it will happen next year.Some 37 years have passed and Oola is without a proper sewerage system, Kilfinnane is without a proper sewerage system, Dromcolliher is without a proper sewerage system, as are Askeaton and Abbeyfeale. One can go across the board. How am I supposed to ask people to come in and invest in our towns and villages when the Government will not give us the basic services? When will the Minister make Irish Water accountable for this? We asked it to go out and look at the services in Croom. There are 100 houses waiting to be built in Croom. Irish Water came back to the builders and the developers to ask them to pay Irish Water to do a survey in Croom. We have 100 houses that could be built there tomorrow morning. All we are hearing from the Government is the first quarter and then the second quarter. Irish Water is now coming back to ask people to pay for a survey, which was done before it took it over from the councils. Now there is only 300 capacity left on the system, when they have put down a new road. Before they did that I asked if there was enough capacity to service the area including Eli Lilly which is coming to Limerick, which is ten minutes in the road from Croom. We could service that economy, yet it puts down new roads and does not look at the services we need. I am looking to service a circular economy. God forbid if a business had to go to the bank tomorrow morning to look for a loan. What is the first thing it will ask? It will ask if the business can give its projections for the next five years. The banks will ask about those projections and how many people will come into the area to service the business. One can say one cannot do it as we have no basic water or sewerage services. The population in our towns cannot increase and this means there is no business. It all comes back to infrastructure, about which I have been asking all the time and which the Government has been promising for 20 years and now for 30 years and it still has not delivered for the people of County Limerick out of all of the other counties.

The Deputy is very passionate about this issue, and rightly so. There are many towns and villages across the State that do not have sufficient wastewater treatment capacity or even wastewater treatment plants. The Deputy will be aware that last year I announced in addition to the €6 billion capital budget Irish Water has - it has a multiannual plan so it can plan into the future and deliver those projects - an additional scheme for unsewered villages and I expect to make announcements before Easter on that. There are a number of schemes in Limerick that have been sent forward by the local authority there. The Deputy is right that there are really good villages right across this country that would expand if they had the capacity. We want that to happen. We are doing that in other ways as well. There is the Croí Cónaithe vacancy grant, for example, which I have extended to rural one-off houses, to towns, to villages and to cities. Since that grant was launched, in Limerick alone we have had 63 applications through the system. We want a lot more. Since 2019 we have brought back 212 properties into use in Limerick. These were vacant and derelict properties. The local authority in Limerick has been very good at acquiring properties through compulsory purchase orders. They have acquired some 153 in the last couple of years. With regard to the Deputy's assertion that Housing for All does not exist in Limerick, that is just not true. I say that respectfully. We have 1,220 social homes approved in Limerick in the system, with another 1,600 at pre-approval stage. We have moved them through a very good pipeline. We have approved the first two affordable schemes in Limerick, as the Deputy will be aware. The affordable purchase scheme did not exist in Limerick previously. We have a very progressive local authority there. I will visit Limerick next Monday. The Deputy may be aware that we have invested €116 million in the Opera Square site and the regeneration of Limerick city. This will have a great positive impact on the county also. I will visit the Opera Square site on Monday. We have approved further borrowing there too. There is a number of very significant sites there also, including the Cleeves site. There is an excellent development team at Limerick Twenty Thirty that works very closely with me and with the Department. There is a lot to be positive about with Limerick city and the region. This Government is committed to the regions and to developing in the regions. I have given the Deputy some examples of what we are doing. The Deputy might be glad to know that I will also visit a private development in Patrickswell, which is 111 new homes, for which people will be able to access the First Home scheme, which is the equity scheme to bridge the gap between the finance a person has and the finance he or she needs. Again, this is in Housing for All. We have had more than 900 approvals for the scheme in six short months. These will be 900 homes for real families there. It is good to see private development happening there too. Other things need to be done and we need to expedite the delivery of wastewater treatment and especially in areas that do not have systems at the moment. I expect to make announcements in that regard in advance of April. I will keep the Deputy fully informed of that.

I am glad the Minister brought up Limerick Twenty Thirty as I am a former member of that board. I understand the investments being made but all the investments the Minister named out today are actually in Limerick city. I want Limerick city to thrive. The Patrickswell development is actually run by the local authority under the city councillors. I am talking about the county. This is where I want to go with this discussion. It is Limerick City and County Council, so the funding should come to city and county councils. When we consider Limerick as a whole in the context of the Land Development Agency it only covers areas that are ten to 15 minutes from the cities. This takes out more than two thirds of Limerick county. This is what I am saying. The Minister is not looking outside of the 15-minute window. The city is in the corner but the county goes all the way to Abbeyfeale and all the way over to the Mitchelstown border. This is what the Government has forgotten about. The Government is not putting in the investment there. I do welcome the investment that is coming to Limerick but I want it to come to all of Limerick. The Government promised in Askeaton that it would deliver but still it has not delivered. When will the Minister deliver? While it is great that the Government promises these things but where can I cash promises? I cannot cash it anywhere. Promises are no good to me unless the Minister fulfils the promise. I will stand over this to make sure that the Government does deliver for county and for city.

For the first time, Uisce Éireann did need to see that they had the security of a multiannual programme. It knows it has the capital between now and 2026. That is why we are seeing the ramping up of the delivery of much needed infrastructure right across the counties in the Republic including Limerick. Limerick county is not forgotten about by this Government. I can absolutely assure the Deputy of that. My Government colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputy Niall Collins, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, and Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and Deputy O'Donoghue, will ensure that this is kept to the forefront of the agenda. I will be making announcements with regard to those schemes before Easter.

The hotel was purchased in 2018 by Mr. Kai Dai, who is one of the biggest cash for visa brokers that has benefited from the immigrant investor programme. Serious issues have arisen at the hotel. On numerous occasions employees at the company were not paid for several weeks. On 1 January last most of the staff were placed on a temporary 12-week layoff, ostensibly for renovation works to be carried out but there has been no evidence of any works commencing. Since then, the staff that have remained have again not received their pay. The leisure centre, which was supposed to remain operational is now closed because the company did not pay its energy bills. There are widespread community concerns regarding the future use of the hotel and its associated facilities. My question and my request for the Minister is that considering the immigrant investment programme was supposed to bring a benefit to the State, but in this case could actually result in a large layoff, will the Minister bring this matter to the attention of relevant ministerial colleagues and also to State agencies such as Revenue, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Health and Safety Authority?

During that year a windfall tax could have recouped money from those profits to assist with the shift to a green economy across the EU and to ease the immense burden of the cost of living and rising energy bills for so many households. Yet, while the planet burns, we are seeing oil magnates and corporates like BP and Shell just cashing in.  I raised this yesterday with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business and asked him when we would see the introduction of a windfall tax by Government and he indicated it was under consideration. I am asking the Minister now when we will see that debate on the introduction of the necessary windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, particularly as families and households are now grappling with severe hardship and poverty due to rising energy bills.

There is no question but that some of the profits we have seen published recently by energy companies, including Shell and BP, are eye-watering. The Taoiseach responded yesterday and it is a matter that will be discussed at European level also. As a State, we have brought in very targeted measures to help households such as the energy tax credit. There is one further payment due to help people through the winter. We were correct in our approach to ensure those supports were targeted as part of an overall cost-of-living package. We had many people catastrophising the situation, although not Deputy Bacik, talking about people being cut off and bills being run up, but the State has stepped in in a very targeted way. We will certainly keep the Deputy informed of progress in regard to her question and I believe it will be matter for discussion at EU level also.

According to the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, approximately €241 million of the Minister’s housing budget from 2022 is being returned to the central Exchequer. This is money should have been spent on building much-needed affordable homes.

First, that would be a matter for the appropriation accounts. We spent more money and had a bigger budget than we have ever had in housing in 2022. There were some constraints on delivery, which I believe the Deputy might accept, in respect of the supply chain difficulties and some projects are running into this year. We said very publicly that we will use our full 10% carryover, which we are doing. We have reallocated moneys within the fund to bring forward things like the land activation fund and to write down debt for local authorities on sites they could not develop because they were encumbered with debt. We have used the money very wisely. I know the Deputy will welcome the social housing figures when we publish them within the next few weeks. We will have delivered more new-build social homes than the State has done in 50 years, even with the constraints we had earlier in the year. I look forward to the Deputy welcoming that-----

It is a great scheme and I know the Minister is carrying out a review of it but there are a number of things he might consider. First, the maximum amount of money available is €30,000 at present. In light of the increasing costs which have occurred in the construction industry, and the fact that the €30,000 was set approximately 11 years ago, I ask him to increase that figure to €60,000. Second, in the area of income threshold and assessment, where a person has a disability, it is very unfair to take the family’s entire income into account when it is being assessed for these grants. The person with the disability is the person who needs the adaptations done to the house and this might keep people at home longer.

The review of the housing adaptation grant is nearing completion and will come to me very shortly. Amendments are required to it and it needs to keep pace with the increased costs we have seen. A review of it has not been carried out in many years. It is a very effective grant and helps many people stay in their homes, where they want to and should stay. We are looking at extending the works which can be included in the housing adaptation grant. We work closely with the Department of Health on this, in particular in respect of hoists, for example, which were not included. We will cover these this year. The review will be published in the coming weeks. We have taken into account the situation in respect of income thresholds and the maximum grant amounts. We have secured an additional budget this year for an additional spend in that space. Once we publish these, they will be there for everybody to see. I appreciate the Deputy’s input into this matter.

During the Order of Business on 18 January, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, gave a response to questions I raised in respect of the closure of St. Brigid’s hospital. I am asking that the record of the House is set straight because the Minister of State said the hospital was more than 200 years old. It is, in fact, 180 years old and that reply was clearly untrue and misleading. The Minister of State said that it was no longer fit for purpose, as deemed by a HIQA report. That is incorrect or misleading because we cannot get the HIQA report which stated that. Perhaps she does not have that report. In addition, the Minister of State said there were health and safety issues with regard to fire. There are no such reports on that either. The last fire report was done in 2019 which deemed the hospital to be fit and safe. I was in the hospital on many occasions and it should not have been closed. It was bad enough for the Government to close it but to give misleading and false information is not acceptable. Will the Government correct the misleading and false information on the floor of the House?

She, like many other transition year, TY, students in my constituency in Donegal, and indeed across the country, are very concerned about leaving certificate reform. On 29 March 2022, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced a plan for major reform of the leaving certificate from 2024 onwards. This will mean students will be starting the new course this coming September. However, since making this announcement, minimal information has been given to students and teachers about that new course. It is not fair for students to be given information about new course changes while they are at the same time preparing for their leaving certificate. I ask the Minister when will students and teachers be given sufficient information about the leaving certificate reform. Will the Minister ensure this is done in a timely manner?

However, the increase in demand for childcare in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West has not been met by a corresponding increase in available childcare places. In fact, an early childhood care and education service in Lucan is currently facing an accommodation crisis in September. If it has to reduce its service, it would be a disaster for the community and would further exacerbate the shortage of childcare places locally. New crèches in new developments always seem to be the last thing built. We have a situation where childcare facilities are promised by developers, approved by local authorities and needed by parents, but still do not exist in places such as Adamstown, Newcastle and Rathcoole. The Government has shown a commitment to reduce the cost of childcare. What commitment can the Minister provide that we will be able to increase the supply of childcare for families that really need it?

That is why, as regards the planning system, we very clearly tied the provision of childcare services in particular with new homes being delivered within estates. Where that is not being provided, I put it to the Deputy that it is a matter for planning enforcement. Planning has a role in making sure that what is granted in the permission is actually delivered. As the Deputy rightly said, this Government is investing significantly in childcare in the amount of approximately €1.25 billion. The 25% reduction in childcare fees has been welcomed by many families throughout the country and it really helps. We also have to ensure that more places are available. There have been issues with recruitment in that sector in getting qualified people to work in our childcare facilities. We are making strides in that regard.

Ballaghaderreen in my constituency is a prime example. More than 400 refugees and international protection families have arrived since 2017. This is a small, rural town that has seen zero supports and nothing additional for it. There are issues around healthcare and education, and additional resources are needed for the likes of the local family resource centre. This is not fair to the refugees who are arriving or on those already living in the town. I cannot understand why Departments cannot all do their bit in providing additional resources. In 2017, a healthcare professional was to be put in what is called the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre, EROC, in Ballaghaderreen to assist with Syrian refugees. That never happened. The promise was broken. There are two GPs in the town who are running waiting lists and cannot cope. I cannot understand why we just let this mess happen when Departments should step up.

There is huge anxiety and concern about the fuel costs that motorists, farmers and hauliers, who cannot plan for the future, are paying at present. Will the Government extend the excise duty reduction we currently have? We are hearing mixed messages from the Government. It appears the Green Party is of a different opinion to Fianna Fáil, from what is being reported in the media. Will the Minister give certainty to families, farmers and hauliers in respect of this issue? One haulier, Mr. Ger Hyland in County Laois, has been in contact with me regarding this issue. Hauliers are very concerned. They provide much employment in rural Ireland where there are little or no opportunities. We need the excise duty reduction to be extended. I call on the Minister to do that.

That is welcome but will the Minister confirm or clarify whether that review will include the issue of equine welfare and horse issues? I will point out that in the part of Cork city in which I live, 25 horses were found abandoned last night, many of them unregistered, with no microchips, in a fairly poor state and, in many cases, emaciated. This is becoming a regular occurrence. I hope that horse welfare will be included in the upcoming review.

We need to make sure that proper controls are in place, especially for certain breeds of dog. That work is ongoing and we want to do it as speedily and efficiently as possible. On the issue of equine welfare, we all saw videos on social media of horses being raced on motorways throughout the country. There was also a terrible situation with regard to a donkey being towed by a car a number of weeks ago. The cruelty shown to animals is, in some instances, frankly, disgusting and the perpetrators need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.The control of dogs working group is looking specifically at that matter. The Deputy is right about animal welfare and animal safety, on which we have very strong laws in this country. In some areas they need to be enforced more efficiently. I will certainly take the Deputy's views on board and relay them to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

They have no drinking water and no heating system that can reach high enough temperatures. With condemned wells, they cannot even shower. A water pre-connection application was submitted to Irish Water and was accepted as part of a feasibility study. My concern, however, is that Mayo County Council has yet to receive the framework for submission process from the Department in order to submit its funding request in respect of the measures.

That our staff have to endure such attacks while endeavouring to deliver care is intolerable and completely unacceptable. It is particularly invidious that some of these attacks are racist in nature. A strong message needs to go out from this House that everybody is welcome in Ireland, regardless of race, creed or ethnicity. People who come here from other countries are particularly welcome in our health service. More than two in every five doctors and nurses employed in the HSE were not trained in Ireland. Without them, we could not provide essential healthcare to our most vulnerable citizens. I say to those who are perpetrating these vile attacks, the person you are attacking is the person you will rely on to treat those you love - your mother, father, son, or daughter - when they are at their most vulnerable. To every healthcare worker in Ireland who comes from another country I say, you are welcome in Ireland, you are valued in Ireland, and the work you do is essential and is appreciated. Thank you for all that you do every day for patients and their families. I welcome the debate today. It is important that this House has the opportunity to discuss these matters which have been subject to public discussion recently. The Government takes seriously the issues raised about how the State has approached legal challenges taken against it. The Government moved quickly to establish the facts surrounding these issues, which go back many decades, by requesting the Attorney General to prepare a report on the litigation management strategy. This comprehensive report was produced within a week and was published on Tuesday to allow for a full and informed debate in the House today. It is important to set out the background and context on both of the matters at hand. I will address the issue of nursing home charges first. Long-term residential care for older people in Ireland is provided by a mixture of public, private and voluntary providers. Up to 2009, when the nursing homes support scheme was introduced, separate arrangements existed for funding care in these different settings. People who were provided with publicly funded long-stay care in public facilities and in publicly contracted beds paid a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance through a charge. The majority of the cost was funded by the State through the health budget. It is a matter of public record that until the mid-2000s the regulations underpinning these charges were not supported by primary legislation. This was the subject of an independent investigation by Mr. John Travers in late 2004, a Supreme Court ruling in early 2005 and much debate in the Oireachtas and in the media at the time. New legislation was enacted in 2005 to regularise these charges and a repayment scheme was introduced in 2006 for those on whom charges had been levied. More than €450 million was paid out under this scheme. The scope of the scheme was well publicised at the time and was limited to those who had full eligibility under the 1970 Act and who had paid charges as a contribution towards their publicly funded care. The situation with private nursing homes was different. People entered into their own contractual arrangements with these homes and were responsible themselves for meeting the costs of the fees. This included people who were assessed as fully eligible under the 1970 Act and had a medical card. The State did provide financial assistance towards the cost of fees through a subvention scheme. The numbers receiving subvention grew over time, from 3,200 people in 1994 to more than 9,900 people in 2004. As per Government policy and as allocated by the Oireachtas, the level of State funding per bed was greater for publicly funded beds than it was for privately funded beds. This policy of funding public and private nursing home care differently was ended in 2008 via the nursing home support scheme. Any eligibility under the 1970 Act was and continues to be subject to the availability of resources. This is the case with all health services provided by the State, given the finite nature of resources. It is not Government policy, nor does the State have an obligation, to use public moneys to pay for private care. For example, where medical card patients today avail of private health or social care services, the State is not obliged to cover those costs. Where private care is availed of, reimbursement may happen under a system of prior approval. This is the case, for example, with private care sourced by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and various initiatives under the waiting list action plan. This brings me to the heart of the issues that have been raised. As the House will be aware, following the Supreme Court judgment in 2005, legal cases were taken against the State relating to claims that the State failed to provide nursing home care free of charge to those who had full eligibility under the 1970 Act. A total of 516 cases were initiated over the period 2005 to 2013, of which 289 were in respect of private nursing home care with a further 37 in respect of a mix of public and private care. The balance were in respect of public nursing home care with the majority of these cases resolved. Cases have been managed by the Department of Health case by case over the years in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. Underpinning the defence of these cases is the position that it was not the policy intent of Government or the Oireachtas for public moneys to be used in this way, and there was not an unqualified entitlement to private nursing home care provision or reimbursement for same. The Attorney General's report provides an account of the litigation management strategy adopted by the State in relation to these cases. The report sets out that the legal advice furnished in respect of the litigation concerning charges levied for private nursing home care was sound, accurate and appropriate, with the conclusion that there is and was a bona fide legal defence to these cases. The report also sets out that the advice provided by the Office of the Attorney General and his predecessors offered a robust justification for the Department of Health to act in the manner it did, under the supervision of various Ministers over the years. The report also sets out that the Department acted prudently in settling claims involving care in private nursing homes rather than risking an adverse outcome in a test case, which could have provoked many more historic cases, with a substantial potential exposure for the taxpayer. The report also stated it is entirely right that the State should be able to adopt a strategy on how best to approach litigation, that it is able to form such a strategy under the protection of legal professional privilege, and that it is appropriate for the strategy to be confidential. I will now address the second issue in relation to the disabled persons' maintenance allowance, DPMA. I am aware that, during the past fortnight, issues have been raised in the media relating to the eligibility of persons living in residential facilities to the disabled persons' maintenance allowance. These issues relate to an extended time period going back almost 70 years. The DPMA was established under section 50 of the Health Act 1953. It was replaced in October 1996, which is 26 years ago, by the disability allowance scheme under what is now the Department of Social Protection. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will be speaking further to this shortly. From 3 January 2007, entitlement to disability allowance was extended fully to all persons resident in institutions who otherwise met the conditions of the scheme. Broadly speaking, the prevailing policy of Governments from the 1950s through to the end of the 20th century was that the State would provide for people with disabilities, either through in-kind support in a residential facility or through financial supports for people living in the community, but that it would not do both. This policy position was enshrined in the first regulations made in 1954 under the legislation under which the DPMA was established, namely the Health Act 1953. It was repeated subsequently in regulations made under the Health Act 1970, which became the subsequent basis for the scheme. This position continued into the Social Welfare Act 1996, when the Department of Social Welfare, as it was known, took over the scheme and renamed it the disability allowance. This allocation of public moneys was approved by the Oireachtas through each budget. The prevailing policy remained unchanged when responsibility for the DPMA transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare in 1996. The Government's policy was further enshrined in the Social Welfare Act 1996, and the period during which a person could continue to receive disability allowance on entry to a residential facility was extended from eight to 13 weeks at this time. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in 1996 emphasised the principles of equal rights, autonomy and choice, and had criticised the exclusion of those in residential care from DPMA. The subsequent 1999 Social Welfare Act provided that those newly entering residential facilities would retain the disability allowance upon admission to long-term residential care. A 2003 interdepartmental working group recommended the repeal of the residential care ineligibility. Following that, and as an interim measure, the Social Welfare Act 2005 provided for a minimum payment of €35 a week to people living in long-term residential care. The residential care ineligibility of people living in long-term care from receipt of the disability allowance was abolished in 2007. Policies in place today providing supports for people with disabilities are different from, and in many ways more progressive than, policies going back to the 1950s. The agency and independence of the individual is better supported, protected and respected. This includes direct financial supports, moving from congregated settings to community living, and provision of multidisciplinary health and social care services. That is not to say that an awful lot more progress is not needed; it certainly is. However, the progress that has been made is important and has made a substantial difference to those living with disabilities.However, I would be the first to acknowledge that we have a long way to go as a State in getting to where we need to be in fully and properly supporting people with disabilities. The approach to allowances is different now than it was during the period under discussion. However, it is clear from a thorough review by the Department of Health and the Attorney General that, from the 1950s to the 1990s, the policy was that the DPMA and, for its first few years, the disability allowance were to support those living in the community and, therefore, did not apply when a person moved into residential care. This was a transparent policy and the intent of governments was clear. It was funded on that basis each year by the Oireachtas over a period of more than 40 years. While we might debate the policy today - the State has moved away from it, and I fully support that move - there was undoubtedly a transparent Government policy in place for many decades and the Oireachtas allocated public moneys on that basis year after year. We began to change the policy during the 1990s, but even today we retain the principle that those in such care contribute towards its cost through the residential support services maintenance and accommodation contribution. While there have been a small number of cases over the years in respect of the DPMA, it is clear that, no matter what weakness may have been found in the law or what mistake may have been made in drafting the legislation in 1953 or transposing it over the years, the intention of the Oireachtas was that those in residential care would not also be in receipt of the DPMA, which was clearly meant to support the costs of living in the community. As noted in the Attorney General's report, "there was a clear and logical distinction between the financial needs of those living in the community in their own homes and those living in a State-provided residential care environment". We look at the world differently today compared with those who sat here in the 1950s or 1970s. Even in my time in the House, we have as an Oireachtas brought in sweeping reforms to how we treat people who are often marginalised by virtue of their gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status or disabilities. We know that work is a long way from being finished. The report from the Attorney General provides us with a comprehensive account of these issues. While we must look to the past, we must also remain committed to the present and the future. The specialist community-based disability budget will amount to approximately €2.6 billion this year. Building on the previous year, this is an unprecedented level of funding for disability services. It will give people with disabilities greater choice, independence and, quite rightly, control over their lives and empower them to participate in their local communities. Our overall investment in older person's services will be more than €2.4 billion this year. That includes nearly €12 million for new services. Older people who wish to continue living in their homes for as long as possible are helped and supported through community services, daycare, meals on wheels, home care etc. Those who require long-term residential care will continue to be supported through the nursing homes support scheme. I look forward to listening to the contributions from colleagues during this debate.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	249	Given the complex historical basis of the DPMA and the disability allowance, I welcome the opportunity to set out the context of this matter for the House. Over the full period of some 70 years, there have been different allowances and legislative provisions governing these schemes and it is important that they be understood clearly. For more than 40 years, the DPMA constituted a weekly allowance paid by health boards to persons who were unable to work by reason of a disability. The scheme was first introduced under the Health Act 1953 and remained under the responsibility of the Minister for Health, the health boards and, subsequently, the HSE for more than 40 years. Responsibility for the allowance's payment and administration transferred to what is now the Department of Social Protection in 1996. At that point, the DPMA was discontinued and replaced by the disability allowance. The introduction and nature of the disability allowance was provided for in primary legislation at the time. I should clarify that the legal concerns around the operation of this payment primarily relate to the period before the scheme transferred to the Department of Social Protection. Subsequent to the scheme's transfer, there were a series of improvements that led to the gradual expansion of entitlement to persons in residential care settings. For example, the Social Welfare Act 1999 provided for the retention of entitlement to the disability allowance where a person who had been living at home subsequently entered residential care. Additional, the disability allowance personal expense rate was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 and was payable at an amount of €35 per week. This payment replaced and standardised the spending allowances that had been paid by the health boards to people in residential care who were excluded from the disability allowance due to being in residential care. This move meant that all persons in residential care could apply for the payment. It represented a decisive step towards the provision, through legislation in 2007, of a full-rate disability allowance for all people in residential care settings who met the scheme's other qualifying criteria. This series of gradual improvements in entitlement was advanced across several budgets that had, of necessity, a regard for a range of competing priorities at those times. Given the timespan over which the restrictions on payment to persons in residential care were progressively relaxed, these issues are historical. They relate to arrangements that have been superseded for many years. Furthermore, the legislative basis for the allowances and their payment changed a number of times during that timespan, adding to the matter's complexity. As a result of these complexities, and in response to public concerns, the Government asked the Attorney General to review the files in the Attorney General's office relating to charges levied for the provision of nursing home care and the non-payment of the DPMA to persons in residential care, and to provide an account of the litigation management strategy adopted by the State insofar as it was based upon the legal advices provided by previous Attorneys General and the Office of the Attorney General. My colleague, the Minister for Health, has spoken to the matters relating to the nursing homes aspect. The Attorney General's report was received this week. The Government has noted it and it has been laid before the Houses and published. The report analyses the nature of the State's approach to civil litigation and provides an explanation of the litigation process. Around the time of the more significant expansions of entitlement in the 2006 to 2008 period, a legal challenge was made to the validity of regulations made under the Health Act 1970 in respect of the 1983 to 1996 period. The Attorney General did not consider it appropriate to name individual plaintiffs in circumstances where their litigation was compromised in a manner to their satisfaction on a confidential basis. Likewise, I do not propose to do so. I understand that the challenge sought to establish a right to the payment of the DPMA to people in residential care settings in a manner that was neither in line with the long-standing and well-understood Government policy of the time nor with the legislative intent of the Oireachtas, as expressed in the Social Welfare Act 1996. These details are set out in the report of the Attorney General. However, rather than contesting the claim, the State decided to compromise the case for reasons also set out in the Attorney General's report. In the view of the Attorney General, this was a legitimate legal approach that did not, as some have portrayed, attempt to force the person concerned through the courts and instead led to the State reaching an agreed settlement with that individual.The settlement was not secret. It was reported in the press at the time, was ruled on by the High Court and was subsequently the subject of a parliamentary question. The question that has been raised in recent public discourse is whether the settlement of this case automatically means all people who potentially could have made a similar claim were denied an entitlement and should now receive a similar settlement. The view of the Attorney General is that, even if the case concerned had been contested in court and even if the regulations concerned were determined to be invalid, it does not follow that there would have been an obligation to compensate people who may have benefited from a payment in the absence of the regulations that specifically excluded them. The Attorney General's report sets out that the State had no positive obligation to provide redress in the cases concerned. There are many documents to consider, dating back over a 50-year period, and that is why it is important adequate time is given to consider the issues at hand. My colleague, the Minister for Health, and I have been asked to review these matters and respond to the Government within three months.  However, it is important we do not provide mixed messages on this and that people with disabilities can be assured of this Government's ongoing support. In budget 2023, a number of important supports were brought forward for people with disabilities, including a cost-of-living double payment, a €500 cost-of-living disability support grant, a Christmas bonus double payment that was paid in December, and a €12 increase in weekly payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults. Domiciliary care allowance was increased by €20.50 to €330 per month and has been made available for children with a severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth. The earnings disregards for both the disability allowance and blind pension were increased by €25 per week, from €140 to €165. These measures build on a range of supports provided in successive budgets, such as improvement to the wage subsidy scheme to facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities; publication of a cost of disability report; the introduction of legislation, known as Catherine's law, to facilitate further education for people with disabilities; and the extension of the invalidity pension to self-employed contributors. I assure the House that the Government remains committed to and ambitious in its support for people with disabilities. I look forward to hearing the contributions.

I welcome the two Ministers. In the past two weeks, we learned that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Ministers knew that tens of thousands of families with medical cards had been wrongfully charged for nursing home care to which they were entitled. That includes up to 9,000 people in long-term residential disability services who were charged so-called voluntary contributions. It includes potentially tens of thousands more families who were forced to fork out for private nursing home care because the Government of the day had refused to put in place any scheme to cover their costs. Fianna Fáil Ministers for health, including the current Tánaiste, Deputy Martin, denied any responsibility for their care despite clear legal advice to the contrary, as covered in the Ombudsman's reports in 2001 and 2010, in the Travers report in 2005, and in the various secret memos which set out the Government’s denial strategy. By the way, none of those memos has been published. None of the memos given to any Minister for Health from 2009 onwards has yet been published by the Government, and that must be said clearly here today. Initially, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, claimed he knew nothing about this strategy. Then he admitted he was briefed on the strategy and it is now the position of the Government that it was a good strategy. The first injustice is that these families were ripped off in the first instance. The second injustice is the heartless political strategy put in place by successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments. It is the same strategy deployed against survivors of historical institutional abuse and of historical negligence in CervicalCheck, and against those affected by the issues of sodium valproate, thalidomide and mother and baby homes. It is a strategy that allows compensation only for the better off while denying the most vulnerable access to justice. The strategy was to stop cases from going to court, to delay, divide and conquer, to wage a war of attrition, to hope they go away, and if they did not, to pay them off and keep others in the dark. The Government’s heartless and cynical political strategy to deny citizens their rights and then to deny them any redress or compensation is set out plainly in the recently disclosed secret 2011 memo on the management of long-stay and related litigation. The memo states "the strategy is that, in general, these proceedings should be fully defended and that a strong case should be identified which can then be fought as a test case”. No strong case ever emerged. No test case was ever heard. The memo goes on to state:Confidentiality has been a central element of the legal strategy. The fear is that if details of the cases, the legal strategy and settlements were to gain a high public profile, it would spark a large number of claims. A 2017 briefing note for the Ministers, Deputies Harris and McEntee, said, "It remains important to manage historic long-stay litigation with extreme care, discretion, and confidentiality due to the very substantial level of liability to which the State could potentially be exposed following an adverse outcome." The note further states:Confidentiality has been a central element of the legal strategy. The risk is that if details of the cases, the legal strategy, or settlements were to emerge, there is the potential for a significant increase in private cases in particular and for an upward creep in the percentage at which cases can be settled. The deployment of this strategy is evidenced in the Conroy case, in which Joseph Conroy, who made his story public in the Sunday Independent at the weekend, pursued a refund of €120,000 spent on private nursing home care for his mother, who had a medical card. Mr Conroy acknowledges that he was one of the lucky few who could afford this care and who could afford to pursue the Department for many years to the point of pushing the Government to settle on the court steps. In an email regarding the Conroy case, an official at the Department of Health wrote to the Chief State Solicitor's office stating:I [can] confirm that, having failed in our attempts to negotiate a settlement ahead of last Tuesday and having considered our legal advices, we had no realistic option other than to consent to a discovery order in the terms arising from the Shallow/McKenzie discovery ruling(s) and that there is no change in the Department’s policy position – informed by legal advices to date from the Office of the Attorney General and ... Ministers Harris & McEntee – that discovery should be avoided in all long-stay cases, including the Conroy case.Discovery should be avoided in all cases - not some, not a few, but in all cases - taken by the State. So much for the argument the State believed in its legal position. It goes on to say, "The reality of making discovery or running a hearing in one of these cases continues to be too risky to be seriously contemplated, and, whether we like it or not, settling the Conroy case – if necessary on terms we may find somewhat unpalatable – appears to be the only way forward." Mr. Conroy took a case. He went as far as he could, got to discovery and the State said it must settle even on terms unpalatable because it did not want to open the floodgates. That is what happened. This demonstrates beyond doubt that the Government knew and knows that it had a responsibility to cover this care in potentially tens of thousands of cases. It lays bare in tangible terms that the Government’s strategy was to avoid handing over damaging documents or engaging in a public trial which might tip off other families that they had been fleeced. The instruction from the Minister, Deputy Harris, and from every Minister before him for 50 years, was to settle all cases at any cost. At no point did a single Minister, including today, stand up and say this was wrong, that we had a moral and ethical duty to address this. Instead of a proactive effort to identify wrongdoing and compensate victims of Government heartlessness, an active effort was made to suppress claims, gaslight victims and deny compensation to those who deserved it. The fact is that the health boards of the time were deciding whether people were going into public or private nursing homes depending on available capacity and in the absence of enough public beds.It was not that families were making choices to go private; health boards were actively putting people into private nursing homes because it was the only option open to families. The families who were entitled to free public care where the capacity was not available had no choice but to go into a private home. Health boards facilitated that due to the fact they had no choice because the Government had not put public capacity in place in the first place. This is clear from the Attorney General’s report.  In some cases, the health boards paid subventions and in other cases they did not, but in all cases of medical card holders placed in private nursing homes and charged for that care, the health boards were acting outside or beyond the law. They advised the Department of this, but the Department said to continue anyway. That was a political choice.  Through no fault of their own, families ended up using private homes due to the political failures of Government. The consequences for many were devastating. The Ombudsman’s 2011 report lays out these consequences and any Minister who thinks this is a good, ethical strategy or just strategy should read it. It highlights the following cases:Her mother is in a private nursing home. It costs £20 a day, £600 a month. The mother’s widow’s pension of £400 does not cover this and her daughter pays the rest. Her husband is on £62 invalidity pension. She is on £45.80 Disability Benefit. Their 17 year old son has left school. Of their income, they have to meet the shortfall of £50 per week. Whatever happens, they will starve themselves rather than move the mother.My wife, Mary, is in a nursing home which costs £130 a week. I am in receipt of a pension of £93 a week. I asked the Community Welfare Officer for help with this, and they got the nursing home section ... to increase the grant to the nursing home to £65 per week. That means I also have to pay £65 a week, leaving me with only £28 to live on.He says that after pay the nursing home fees of £170 a week, he has only £35 per week to live on. Whatever savings they had are being gradually eroded and he feels they will not have sufficient [funds] to bury themselves.That is a small sample of those who made complaints to the Ombudsman at the time. The human consequences of this heartless strategy was laid bare. When it came to redress, those in public homes were included, but families put into private homes by the health boards and ripped off were left high and dry despite their hardship being a direct result of the Government’s political choices. The Government, in the Attorney General’s report, says that it could have acted legally. This serves to highlight the very point that the Government acted illegally.  The Attorney General goes on to state that there were clear and bona fide legal defences available to the State, but these were never tested in court. In 2016, a briefing note states that, “there is no obvious lead case, and therefore settling, for the best possible economic value, is the most appropriate course of action". If the Government was so confident in its legal defence, why was it so afraid of taking cases to the courts? Why was it afraid of the Conroy case going to discovery? Why was it so afraid of details of these claims and cases coming out? Why would utmost secrecy be so essential if the Government was confident and had good faith defences which would hold up in court? The answer is clear; it is because the Government’s position was and is still wrong. It could not find a single case that it could fight and win. The Government settled the Conroy case, and hundreds like it, as well as several hundred cases related to long-term residential disability services, even where it found the settlement amounts unpalatable because, "the reality of making discovery or running a hearing in one of these cases continues to be too risky” as it would expose the Government’s heartless political strategy. Regarding people in long-term residential disability services, the 2011 memo estimates a potential liability of some €360 million. The memo outlines how the Government sought to deny any repayment to these families, numbering up to 9,000, who had been wrongfully charged for long-term residential disability services.  Many thousands did not apply to the health repayment scheme, as the Government intended, on the basis that they were not included in the definition of a public home. That was a deliberate strategy to exclude them from redress. Some 515 cases were put on behalf of residents with disabilities in the care of St. Michael’s House, Cheeverstown House and the Daughters of Charity. Three test appeals were considered by the scheme’s appeals officer, and the memo notes there are 512 similar appeals. The Government, rather than righting these wrongs, sought instead to challenge the ruling of its own appeals officer. However, it did not in the end because, as the memo notes, "the Department has received advice from Senior Counsel on these cases, which suggests that the State is likely to have difficulty successfully proceeding with these appeals". Over the following years, some €20 million was paid out to these appeal cases in settlements, as disclosed in the HSE’s financial statements.  However, the issue for the Ministers here today is the other 8,500 who may, and indeed did, have an entitlement to redress, but had either not applied on the advice of Government that they were ineligible or did not appeal on the basis of that same advice. They have been left high and dry. These were residents with moderate to profound disabilities whose families were wrongfully charged for their care, and were on the receiving end of the Government of the day's cold and heartless political strategy which first denied them of their rights, then made them pay for it and then, despite knowing they were likely entitled to compensation, decided to keep them in the dark. These numbers were not picked from the air. When the Department estimated the liability at the time, that was based on real people. The figures are clearly calculated on the basis of records held by the Department and HSE which demonstrate that such a value of fees was wrongfully charged and taken from families, older people and people with disabilities. To this day, the Ministers are not prepared to admit in the Chamber that was a mistake. Some families and those homes which appealed the decision were paid, but those who did not were left to suffer in silence. There was more secrecy and people were not told the truth. Subsequent settlements valued in the tens of thousands clearly give the lie to the notion that Government was not responsible for the costs of their care. We do not need to look any farther than the Conroy case, which demonstrates beyond doubt that the Government knew it was responsible in many more cases than it admitted.  It has also emerged that up to 12,000 people with disabilities living in residential care had their disability allowance payments illegally taken from them. The Government has now recognised that this was wrong. The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said last week that the Government had no legal leg to stand on. Yet, according to the Government this week, while it may have been unlawful to stop the payments it has no legal obligation to pay them back. That is perhaps the most sickening element of these scandals and demonstrates the callousness with which this Government acts. We take money from people that we should not be taking from them, and we know we are acting outside the law but will do everything possible not to pay them back. When that was happening, no end of money was found to set up NAMA, to bail out developers or to put into the banks. Tens of billions of euro could be found. We hear from Government about finite resources, but there were no finite resources when it came to bailing out the banks.  However, when it came people with disabilities and vulnerable people in nursing homes, a strategy was developed to keep people in the dark and not pay them. That goes to the heart of the callousness of this Government. Despite a clear moral and ethical duty to pay these families back, the Government considers that it has no legal obligation to do so, and if the families want their money back they will need to spend thousands to pursue matters through the courts. For far too long, Governments have taken an aggressive and combative approach to those who have been wronged by the State. From the treatment of Brigid McCole, who was dragged through the courts in her final months, to Vicky Phelan and the brave CervicalCheck victims who stood up to attempts to bully them into silence, Louise O’Keeffe and victims of institutional abuse, Thalidomide survivors, families affected by sodium valproate and many more, they were all wronged by the State. It was an absolute disgrace that in the Minister's opening statement there was no apology or acceptance of wrongdoing. The Minister doubled down and that is absolutely shameful.

It is to look after all of its citizens, including the elderly and vulnerable, and to ensure fairness and that people get their rights and entitlements. Again again, successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have failed the people.  The report from the Attorney General published on Tuesday divides the citizens concerned into two convenient groups, those in public and private nursing homes. However, the report makes no reference to our most vulnerable citizens, that is, those in long-term residential disability care settings. Many of those people depended on the Government of the day to advocate on their behalf and not to deny them their rights. There are three groups of people with disabilities potentially entitled to payments, but only one was paid. The first group comprises those who never applied the scheme because they were advised not to. The second group comprises those who did apply but who were told by a deciding officer they were not entitled to repayment under the scheme and, because of that, did not appeal the decision.The final group comprises the minority of people who did appeal and ultimately were the only ones to receive what was due to them. They were the ones who were fortunate enough to have an organisation that advocated on their behalf and remained persistent to the end despite barriers put in place by the Government. To not similarly compensate over 8,500 people with disabilities in similar long-term care settings whose entitlements should have been similar but who had nobody advocating on their behalf and to actively work to deny them their entitlements must be the lowest of the low for any Government. Despite Government protestations, it is clear that thousands of patients were unfairly charged for their care, Government after Government and Minister after Minister were happy to keep the public in the dark about this scandal and the Government tried its utmost to deny redress to those thousands of patients. Now that the Government's policy has been exposed, what steps has it taken to identify those 8,500 people who had money taken from them illegally? If it has started a trawl, although there is no confirmation of this, it is only because it has been exposed. Now the Government has been found out, is it going to continue its policy of protestations and denials? If a person was to take a case today on the same basis as the cases settled, would the Government defend or settle that case? That is the question.  A couple of times, I heard Ministers refer to this as historical. However, there is a scandal that happens day in and day out, yesterday, today and tomorrow. This is the scandal of charging patients in nursing homes who have medical cards for products to which they are entitled free of charge on their medical cards. They are charged for incontinence wear, ointments, wound dressings and occupational therapy and speech therapy, all entitlements they would have free of charge were they living in the community. I have raised this issue numerous times with the HSE and the Department at the Committee of Public Accounts but the HSE could not give a damn about it. In a document I received under freedom of information legislation, the assistant national director for primary care reimbursement service said the primary place where an intervention could be put in to ensure that nursing home clients are not charged for items that would be covered under the medical cards scheme would be via inserting a clause in the document between the HSE and nursing homes that actually states the requirement not to charge. Despite the fact that this statement is two years old and it was raised with the Secretary General of the Department last week, the HSE has still done nothing. This is happening today. Patients with medical cards who are in nursing homes are being ripped off and are not getting their full entitlements. Will the Minister put a stop to that because the HSE could not give a damn?

Whether it was those who were unfairly charged in nursing homes, those whose lives were destroyed by the hepatitis C bad blood scandal in the 1980s or the small number still alive who suffered the lifelong birth effects of thalidomide, Governments consciously planned strategies and schemes to see that they were not treated fairly or given the answers and justice they sought. While there may be an onus on Government to protect the coffers and act in the interests of the State, there is a tendency to forget that the State is also made up of those vulnerable citizens who have been failed and left with no option to go to the courts to seek redress and compensation. Is it too much for us to ask as legislators that the Government also acts in the best interests of those who have been so badly wronged?  I ask for full co-operation from all those who were in positions of authority and power in the decision-making process to deny fair redress to work with the Oireachtas Committee on Health or the Committee of Public Accounts in their investigations. While the Government may claim that this wrong is "historical", it replicates a pattern of denial and smoke-screen tactics whenever cases like this arise. This behaviour is unacceptable and misguided.  There must be a fundamental shift in how we view the damage that can be done to people's lives by cold and cruel decisions that deny legitimate claims by victims and their families. We must not fight survivors like the survivors of the hepatitis C debacle or the women who were failed by CervicalCheck. We must not hide the truth away, compound hurt and have it dragged out piece by piece. Where wrongs have been done by Government, they must be corrected and where damage has been caused, there must be redress. I do not think anyone could disagree with anything I have said. The approach of Government is wrong. It has been wrong in the past and from the statements we have heard today, we have not learned any lessons from those awful times. 
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	253	Since the report in the Mail on Sunday on 29 January 2023, we have seen the report of the Attorney General, which was utterly disappointing, and have heard the statements from the Ministers this afternoon that ricocheted off the central injustices that have been exposed rather than grappling with and accepting them and detailing a path we need to travel. In the report last Sunday week, it was revealed that successive Ministers of Health employed and maintained a secret legal strategy to block or minimise compensation to older persons and their families who were or who might have been illegally charged for nursing home care.  The issue has never been tested in court. The lack of a test case is because the State's aggressive legal strategy made sure that no case could ever get to a full court hearing. As the 2010 Ombudsman's report suspected and as the Government's information note last week confirmed, cases were settled before discovery, that is, the publication of documents, to avoid encouraging more cases to be taken.  A central part of the injustice is that it was clear that people who had the resources - personal capacity, money, agency or links - to challenge the fees had them quietly dropped whereas other people without the same personal capacity, money or links and who may have been in the same nursing home or even the same room continued to be charged, sometimes for years and sometimes with major consequences for families such as being forced to sell homes, farms, businesses or other assets.  As the Ombudsman's 2010 report found, many people over these decades have been deprived of their legal entitlement and access to nursing home care over this period was marked by confusion, uncertainty, misinformation, inconsistency and inequity. The Ombudsman was deeply concerned about what the issue suggested about how adequately officials were briefing their Ministers and the whole nature of the Executive-legislative relationship.  While the 2009 nursing homes support or fair deal scheme put in place a new fees regime for nursing home care, it did not address the fundamental inequalities and injustices that occurred from 1970. The issue is not just that people were or might have been illegally charged for nursing home care but that the illegality was known for decades and health officials just kept on going. Now we discover that there was an aggressive legal strategy to frustrate access to justice for those affected.  On the question of medical cards, the Travers report notes that those with a medical card were not required to pay inpatient service charges but institutional assistance charges were payable. Those not who were fully eligible, that is, not in possession of a medical card, were liable to pay both. The Travers report makes it clear that the 1976 circular from the Department of Health tried to work around the law rather than amend it. That circular instructed officials to remove medical cards from people in long-term care, thus depriving them of the criteria that would make them fully eligible for free-of-charge care. This ignored the fundamental illegality of the charging regime. For example, in respect of section 3.2, it stated that a central feature of the legal concerns has been that the use of secondary legislation in the form of a ministerial regulation as a means of setting aside a substantive provision of primary legislation is ultra vires. It is not clear that the 2006 health repayment scheme included all relevant cases. The view was that the terms of reference for that repayment scheme were very narrowly written to minimise the numbers of who could apply for compensation. The information note about the legal strategy suggests awareness that a much larger cohort of people could be eligible for compensation. About 20,000 people were compensated through the 2006 scheme, whereas potentially 250,000-plus were affected by fees since 1970. The 2006 scheme also had a cut-off point of 1988, with people charged before that date not included, yet there is no explanation as to why this is the case. A complicating factor about medical card holders being entitled to free-of-charge care in public beds is that the State had public beds in public facilities, that the State publicly funded beds in voluntary, not-for-profit private nursing homes, and that the State had publicly funded contract beds in private, for-profit nursing homes, potentially in the same building as non-public private beds. Were all these types of bed included in the 2006 scheme?  Another gap in our knowledge relates to the detail of the subvention scheme that existed prior to 2009. Part of this appears to have involved means-testing the wider family of people in nursing homes, with adult children asked to contribute to costs. This seems like an extraordinary overreach in that it involved means-testing a person's children before giving him or her a subvention. These are things we still do not know about this scheme and the lack of publication of documents relating to this since the matter returned to the public consciousness last Sunday week is a great cause for concern. The Labour Party supports Age Action's call for the appointment of a commissioner for ageing and older persons as a matter of urgency to strengthen the institutions of the State that are independent of the Government in order that such scandals as those we are discussing cannot happen again. There are already commissioners in Northern Ireland and Wales with proven track records of service to older persons. The Attorney General's report was deeply disappointing. It seeks to conflate the interests of the Government with the interests of the State by, for example, invoking the taxpayer as a “client” of the Attorney General. It places undue and inaccurate emphasis on Government policy rather than legislation as the basis for spending decisions. It is quite simply wrong to state that "In the ordinary course, expenditure on social protection and health is a matter for Government." It would be more accurate to insist that where legal entitlements have been spelled out in health and social welfare Acts, the Government must seek the funds to meet that expenditure or else seek to have those Acts amended. There is no other policy option. The report confirms that legal professional privilege has not been waived by the Government, so the Attorney General cannot provide any details of the advice provided. While more or less conceding in the report that medical card holders should not have been charged for their stay in public nursing homes, the Attorney General maintains there is a viable legal defence when it comes to private nursing home residents, but he seems to be demolishing an argument that no one has made. He states, "At no stage did the Oireachtas ever legislate (in the 1970 Act or otherwise) to make the provision of private nursing home care free to all persons in nursing homes of their own choice." No one has ever argued that, however. What is being argued is that if the State fails in its statutory obligation to provide a public placement and instead places someone in a private nursing home, the individual resident should not be out of pocket. This argument is not recognised or addressed in the report and that is a fundamental failing. It is nowhere explained why, if the State had a bona fide and viable defence, it was prudent to settle so many cases, with not one of them proceeding to a court hearing. Quite simply, this lacks any credibility. We would like to see full transparency, with all documentation to be published, to get to the root of the matter and determine why issues such as this occur again and again. As the recent revelations show, the State approaches litigation in a manner that is indistinguishable from that of any faceless private, corporate entity. It is a war of attrition against those who dare to sue it. There must be a change in approach. There is a clear and compelling case for splitting the Office of the Attorney General in two to separate the task of defending the interests of Departments from that of representing and defending the public interest. The Attorney General is not in the same position as a commercial law firm. Defence strategies for litigation against the State have to be prepared with a proper consideration of the public interest. This must be a watershed moment in Irish politics. We must make the necessary changes to prevent vulnerable people from being let down by the system. The most effective way to reprioritise the public interest over cost containment is to empower the Office of the Attorney General to draft strategies to defend the public interest just as doggedly as it currently pursues the narrower interests of Departments. Aggressive legal strategies designed to quash, suppress or minimise an entitlement or eligibility for any citizen is something no government should stand over, whether that is the current Government, any previous Governments including those in which my party has been involved or, indeed, any future government. In the case of the disability allowance payments, for which it was a direct action not to trawl through State records to see who would be entitled to redress or justice, this too is an action over which any State body or Government cannot stand and as such, no Government past or present can stand over it either. True transparency and openness in public life is tested by issues such as this. Accordingly, whistleblower legislation and freedom of information legislation, which we brought in, are good, but exposing the mistakes and bad decisions of the past is not enough in and of itself. We need a path to make up for these mistakes and this is an opportunity to do that. It is not enough that, when something like this is raised, as it has been over recent weeks, the Government would list out other areas where it has addressed an historical injustice and put in place a redress scheme or whatever the case may be. It is with each new case that we need to ensure we address that injustice and put something in place. We still need to see documents and we need the matter to go to the Joint Committee on Health or the Committee of Public Accounts and to be discussed further in the Dáil. This Thursday-afternoon debate cannot be the end of the matter. This should be a watershed moment. While the Government and the State should be entitled to defend themselves against vexatious or nuisance claims, when it comes to real issues where the State's legislation is flawed, failed or weak, the State needs to be open and transparent and act in the interests of the individual, not in the narrow interests of its own Department.

The way older people are treated in our society is not great and has disimproved, not least as a result of what happened with Covid. We still await the announcement of the inquiry into the deaths of all those people, the majority of whom were aged over 65, who died of Covid, mostly in our nursing homes. A total of 37% of those deaths were deemed to be excess deaths, that is, deaths of people who would otherwise not have passed away. There is something wrong with the way we treat older people in our society and with the way they are cared for. At the heart of this debate is a denial of an entitlement to care in a public nursing home, whereby persons who had that right had to go to a private nursing home to get their care, which they had to pay for. That is what happened. It was wrong and it should not have happened, but it did. The Government has to address that wrong, and I would support a proper and appropriate analysis over the next three months, which the Government is looking for, to ensure the correct decisions are now made. A family were told to bring an umbrella as their relative died behind a glass window in a nursing home. Nine members of the family stood outside that window and saw their loved one pass away while nobody inside went to help that dying person. Twenty-three people died in Dealgan House nursing home, as the Minister well knows, given he met the families, but yet he has not yet agreed to a special inquiry into deaths in that home and other homes about which he has been notified. He has a lot of work to do, and I must say, I was not particularly impressed with what he said in his opening remarks. This is an opportunity for the Minister to do what he said he would do and what I said I would do in supporting the Government in respect of the programme for Government. He needs to follow up on those commitments, one of which relates to keeping people out of nursing homes in the first instance. He needs to follow up on the home care system, which will keep people in their homes, looked after and cared for by people who are qualified and appropriately paid. It is time for him to appoint a commissioner for ageing, something Age Action Ireland is fighting for but which he has not conceded. We need to fight ageism in our society because it is rampant, in this House and in other places. It can be seen in the way older people are treated in many places in our society. An independent commissioner would be in a position to vindicate the rights of older people, which nobody right now is doing. We need to vindicate the rights of older people in regard to housing, living in place, transport needs and dealing with illegal nursing home charges, which other Members mentioned and which the Government committed to removing for people who currently are being forced to pay them. The Department of Health is doing nothing about that. A commissioner for ageing could look at commissioning independent research. It could look at the rights of older people over 65 years; advocate for older people; mediate in disputes; and do the research that is needed. When will the Minister give more powers to HIQA to investigate individual complaints? Nursing home reports are full of references to complaints made by individuals which HIQA cannot follow up. Who is looking after these older people in cases where they are being abused? Who is vindicating their rights? It is time for the Minister to do that. It is not acceptable that the present situation can continue. Dementia care is a huge issue. It is something everyone in society is aware of. We have hugely important community resources dedicated to looking after people with dementia. I would like to see a lot more of them and many more supports going into them. The housing adaptation grant is there to help people live in place. It is an annual allocation made through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is not always spent. The Minister needs to look again at the housing adaptation grant and to increase it exponentially and ensure that people who need their homes adjusted are able to live in place.  At the heart of all this is pressure on families and especially on older people. People have gone to court. The Attorney General has made a very fine professional argument but it does not matter how many lawyers, politicians or Ministers make arguments in fine and well-versed language. That does not get away from the fact we are not doing enough to help older people. There is an opportunity now to plan for transformational change in the coming three months and transform the services which exist for older people. I want to speak up for those people who have had to go to court to fight for their legal right to take the challenges that had to be taken because the HSE, in the case I am aware of, will not vindicate their rights until forced to do so. On historic challenges, I will speak about a man - I will use his first name which was David - who died about nine years ago. He died in a ward in Cherry Orchard Hospital in appalling, shameful circumstances. He had a disability. It was not immediately before his death but during his care there that he was tied to a toilet and was found covered in his own faeces. He could not move. He was treated appallingly by some staff there. The recommendation from the HSE when it closed the AIDS unit he was in was that he would go to a special centre that care for people with the illness that he actually had. The HSE did not do that. It said it would not do that - we have the reference to that - but that he would be looked after in a ward for older people. That was totally inappropriate and wrong. He was treated appallingly. The family fought and I fought with along them. We had meetings with CEOs, acting heads and God knows who. Eventually, we got the HSE to agree that a doctor would carry out an inquiry. Unfortunately, the doctor had to resile from that work in the course of his investigations. Then they could not get any doctor in the whole of Ireland to look at this case for some strange reason. They were going to Scotland to get someone to do the inquiry but then got a private company of specialists in Ireland to carry out the inquiry into how David died. That inquiry vindicated what the family was saying. It vindicated in full that he was abused, that all his needs were not being met and that what happened to him was wrong. However, the HSE was not happy with that and it sought a further independent inquiry from the United Kingdom. That took place and it absolutely vindicated the family which had to go to litigation to fight for their rights. At the end of the day, there was a court case which took years. It was historic in that sense. This was because a person was abused. The family fought for their rights and they were put through hell to get there. Thankfully, the family has closure in that respect. There are many problems outstanding in our nursing homes. Our bigger nursing homes are taking over. Smaller ones are closing. We have a duty to try to keep the smaller ones open. Many of the smaller ones are closing because they are in old buildings and they are fire hazards. I am talking about smaller homes of usually under 30 beds. If it is possible to keep them open the State could give them a low-interest rate loan to do the repairs or improvements that are needed. There could be co-operation between a number of smaller homes in different counties in the purchase of equipment and the provision of services. Many excellent staff in smaller nursing homes are leaving to go to bigger nursing homes. The reason is they get more pay and a bigger challenge. Were there to be some sort of involvement by the HSE, where it would appoint specialist people who would work in the public sector and provide services specifically to the smaller nursing homes, it would make a huge difference in keeping these homes open. This Government has done many good things. The budget, in particular, improved the pension for older people, which is very welcome. The extension of the free fuel scheme to those under and over 70 years will benefit more than 80,000 people. Many good things have been done but much more needs to be done. In the coming three months, I suggest this is a key point to deliver on the promises that have been made. When he concludes, I ask the Minister to update the House on how he will deal with the Covid inquiry. Will he agree to meet the Dealgan House residents again to update them? He is well aware of their situation. Will he comment on the issue of keeping smaller homes open, which is hugely important? There are different figures for the money owed to these people, of between around €8 billion to €12 billion or whatever. Many of these people have passed, sadly, and are not with us. At this stage, I would like to see very significant investment and improvements in services for older people and to see us use the money wisely to fulfil the promises which the Minister made. We can work with Age Action Ireland, ALONE and other services to put implement the promises made but which need to be delivered. I understand the Minister's care commission may not commence until at least next year but that is too late. People want the commission of care now. They also want to see the promised improvements in the care of older people now. The ombudsman for older people is the person who will vindicate the rights of all older citizens into the future. I ask the Minister to consider that as part of this package and make an immediate start on that. There is an ombudsman for older people in Wales and Northern Ireland and I understand the annual budget is €2 million. That is not a lot of money and it would make a huge difference in vindicating rights.

It is shocking that they or any of their countrypeople are subjected to racial abuse in this country. As the Minister did, I thank them for their contribution and apologise on behalf of those elements who have targeted essential people who come to our country. The Minister’s comments were welcome but he needs to establish a public awareness campaign. That was made clear to us by all the health unions which came to the health committee yesterday. I hope the Minister picks up on that. The Minister said in his opening comments that this comprehensive report was produced very quickly and allows a full and informed debate in the House today. I do not accept that for a moment. This is not a comprehensive report. This is a report requested of the Attorney General. The Government asked him, as he pointed out in the report. In relation of the two issues before us, he was asked to provide an account of the litigation management strategy adopted by the State, insofar as it was based on the legal advices. That is all. That is a particularly narrow, though important, focus. The issues before us are much wider than that, encompassing people’s rights, what we are as a society and what the Government is as a political organisation which has to take a much broader view than what is legally possible or advisable. We cannot have a fully informed debate unless we get into those broader issues. This is not about what is legally advised, but what is right and fair. That seems to have been lost in this. Successive Ministers through many years are hiding behind the legal strategy. That strategy can be defended and, viewed through a narrow lens, can be seen as legitimate. However, the job of Government is not solely to be mindful of the legal strategy advised. It is to take a broader view of people’s rights and what it means to be a properly inclusive society. That is being missed in all of this.  I question the role of the Attorney General in this. It would have been more appropriate and informative to bring somebody else in - somebody of the standing of John Travers, for example. He did a report in the 2000s that took that broader view. That is what we need. It would refer to the legal strategy and the management of it, but also take a broader view. It was a mistake to confine this to the Attorney General. He has a strict constitutional role, which is to "be the advisor of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion". That is the extent of it. It is the job of Government to decide what is most appropriate in terms of providing services for the public and what creates a properly functioning society. That wider issue is not covered, unfortunately. The relationship between a client and lawyer is underpinned by the principle that lawyers advise but clients decide. Irrespective of the legal advice the Attorney General provides, it is the job of the Government and of politicians to take the advice on board and decide on the broader range of issues that need to be taken into consideration. It has been suggested to me that in a normal lawyer-client relationship the client asks if he or she can do such and such a thing, but when it comes to Government, the question should be “Should we do that? Is it right to do that? That may be the legal advice, but should we be doing that?” It seems that was not really asked. Taking that broader view is what politics is about and should be what good Government is about. It is the job of Government to defend the rights and entitlements of this country’s citizens, not to ride roughshod over them in the interests of financial expediency. That seems to have been the approach taken by successive governments and Ministers in purely following the strict legal advice.  I have many concerns about the Attorney General’s report. The tone of it is not particularly helpful. It is quite condescending. It is almost as though he is saying grown-ups in government have to make tough decisions which the general public could never understand. Then there is the language it uses and the insistence that it is all about protecting the taxpayer. Taxpayers are also people with disabilities, older people and people with family members who need the care of the State. Financial constraints are one aspect but there are other issues that should be taken into consideration. He also sets up a straw man when he says: It is sometimes tempting to resort to generic stereotypes about the State being in some way cruel or unfair to its citizens where they are deprived of a benefit and bring legal proceedings challenging this deprivation. But the irresistible logic of such a perspective is that the State has unlimited resources, must concede every court case that is brought against it, and must fund every claim for compensation or redress that is demanded of it.That is a straw man. Nobody is claiming that for one moment but we are looking for Government to balance protection of the public purse with vindicating the rights of weaker citizens.  There have been a number of enlightening responses to the Attorney General’s report. I was most struck by Máiréad Enright of the University of Birmingham, who wrote in The Journal yesterday. She made the point that “the State is a peculiar type of defendant because it is the plaintiff’s protector as well as her opponent; her opponent because it is defending itself against her claim, and her protector because it has duties to guarantee her fundamental rights.” That broader view was not taken into consideration. I was also struck by the Disability Federation of Ireland’s point that it is deeply discouraging that the report took such a narrow view, with no mention of reflection on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. That refers to what happened in relation to the disability payments. It makes no mention of the UNCRPD or Ireland’s responsibilities as a signatory to that important international human rights convention. A blinkered view was taken. It is one thing for the Attorney General to take such a view, but it is an entirely different matter for Government to take it. I absolutely endorse Age Action’s call for an independent commissioner for ageing. I return to a point I made last week when I raised this with the Taoiseach. Running through all this is the absence of a legal entitlement to healthcare. This has been at the root of many of these problems. There is no such entitlement to healthcare, while there is one to social welfare, for example. We use the vague term “eligibility”. People are eligible for services but, in many cases, those services do not exist. Given a situation where there is no underlying right to most healthcare services and the direction of travel of this and previous governments has been towards the increasing privatisation of services, the window of opportunity for public patients to access public services is getting narrower and narrower.  Will the Minister apply his mind to the need for a legal entitlement to healthcare? I do not know why he has three months to consider this further. That sounds very much like kicking the can down the road.Before the Minister comes back to us again on this issue, will he please concentrate on the need to introduce a legally based right to public healthcare?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	256	At the outset, we have a calamity regarding public nursing homes, private nursing homes, section 38 and 39 nursing homes and another calamity regarding disabled persons' maintenance allowance, DPMA. Despite the fact that while it has been acknowledged by Government representatives that the State does not have a leg to stand on as regards the DPMA, for example, there needs to be an acknowledgement of that and an apology given to those people who were affected by it. The scale of this is massive, unfortunately. This has been left to fester for years without being addressed properly. I ask the Minister to address one thing when he gets the opportunity to speak. At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts in September 2011, there was an issue around liability, or potential liability, being put at €1 billion. I estimate that if €22,600 has been paid out per claimant to date in those cases that were successful, which was the average cost, that would indicate a cost of €1.58 billion, which is substantially higher than the estimated €1 billion. However, there is a key issue around the fact that it was not and has not been included in the HSE's financial statement. This was raised nearly 12 years ago at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General at the time said that there was really nothing to add, that the policy had been set by the Minister and that the accounts were framed on the basis of the Minister's direction and accounting policies. The Minister might reply as to whether he has given such direction regarding the policy on that. It would be important to know that. The charges have impacted severely on people who are on low incomes. I received a call last week from a constituent I will call "Mary", although that is not her correct name. "Mary" told me that her father was in a public nursing home during this period and for the years he was there, her mother would send her across with an envelope. Her first child had been born and "Mary" would push her child across in the buggy with an envelope given to her by her mother. Her mother would draw the pension every Friday morning, put money in an envelope and seal it - "Mary" never knew how much was in it - and ask her to bring it over to the nursing unit in the hospital where her father was being cared for. She was to give it to the nun in charge, who would take the money. As far as "Mary" can recollect, a receipt was never given. However, she informed me that this went on for a number of years. I have heard similar stories but that is one I will share with the Minister. There are a number of questions around the Department's handling of this. Will the Department now inform former residents of public nursing homes and people who were there in the relevant period whether they are entitled to compensation, where compensation has been granted already in those cases? We need to know the number of cases settled with regard to private nursing homes and the value of those settlements. The Minister might address the likely number of people whose cases have not been addressed in respect of the DPMA, and the situation regarding people in private nursing homes, regardless of whether they have a medical card or in the event they are directed to a private nursing home. That gives them the same entitlement, in fairness, as anybody in a public nursing home with a medical card. That needs to be established and those people need to be treated the exact same. It would be helpful if the Government and Department of Health outlined what they expect in terms of an influx of cases regarding what has happened in the last fortnight and the information that is now in the public domain. That needs to be crystal clear. We as an Oireachtas need accountability on this. We need to see what the potential liability is. These matters need to be addressed. We cannot have people who for one reason or another did not have the resources or wherewithal to claim to be at a loss while people who took a case had it settled out of court because the State did not want it to go to court in a public forum where this would all come out in the open. That is not good enough.

If we want to understand this, we only need to go back to contribution made by the then Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, to the Seanad in March 2005 when she set out the history of this issue and referred to the High Court decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court. She said that: "At the time the regulations were introduced, the Department issued a circular to the health boards effectively telling them that they could move people away from full eligibility by taking away their medical cards." That is just outrageous. It does not shock me anymore because I have seen this tactic in play in many different Departments. However, when we see it set out in black and white, dating back to 2005, we begin to understand that there is, indeed, a strategy here; there is a practice being followed. That practice, essentially, is to defend the State at all costs, whether it is right or wrong, and down the citizen, or ensure the muscle of the State wins over a person or group taking an action. The former Minister went on to say that "by removing the medical cards, they became ... [people of] limited eligibility and could be charged." She continued that with regard to "the High Court and Supreme Court decisions, the then legal adviser of the Department of Health, as it then was, stated it was not possible to amend primary legislation by regulation, which is significant." The Eastern Health Board brought forward the legal advice it had received, which stated:The difficulties being experienced in levying charges on persons for long-stay care in health board institutions 'arises from the failure of the legislature to deal with the question of charges for maintenance ... in a clear and unambiguous fashion when the 1970 legislation was being passed'. Basically, it went on from there with people knowing it was a problem and yet the Department did not address it. As this went on, and the Department sought advice but did not do anything about it, we come to the famous meeting in the Gresham Hotel. The Gresham grandees at that particular meeting were advised because Mary Harney in her report to the Seanad said that advice had been distributed. The Travers report referred to the accountability necessary by both the administrators of State - the bureaucracy - and Minister for Health. Travers went on to state:I did not exclude the politicians from responsibility for these matters, I said that the politicians should have probed more deeply over the years and I include the former Minister, Deputy Martin, in this. This probing was not done.It was dysfunctional within the Department. The normal, standard procedures were not followed. The result was that people were deprived of their rights and that a strategy was put in place as to what was needed to be done. This is not new to me. We have seen it elsewhere, for example, in the case of Shane Corr who is now making all these revelations in the media. Is now the time to invite Mr. Corr in, in the response to all of his letters to the Minister, to talk to him in detail about what has yet to come? Mr. Corr has said there is more to come. We need to know what that "more" is. Is it not time to look back on the issues within the Department? The thalidomide issue has been mentioned. It is yet unresolved but the Department continues to spend millions of euro on legal advice to fight off those thalidomide victims who are left, in trying to ensure that time will take care of things. That is a shocking policy or strategy to be employed by the State. In the Grace case there was a similar Thursday debate here and we said that we would return to that issue because of what it revealed and yet nothing has happened. We continue to wait for the final outcome of the Farrelly commission report, but in the meantime the legal eagles and officials in the HSE are undermining the board of the agency in Waterford that was at the centre of this. The board members are trying to do the right thing. They are lay persons and over this coming weekend they are considering whether they should resign altogether or not from that. These are decent people making an effort to do the right thing but they are being confronted by the HSE and its legal arm to ensure they move things on away from the HSE and on to some other issue. Let us consider the Vicky Phelan case and the bravery of that woman in not signing a confidentiality agreement and for coming out to deal with the issues openly and honestly. She too revealed a State that was continually trying to undermine the citizen, the person who was wronged by these strategies. It is there for everyone to see and the Minister seems to deny it in here. It now seems also to be denied by the Government. That is wrong. The first duty of a government is to keep its people safe. We are not keeping our people safe. We are exposing them to all sorts of litigation challenges just to protect the interests of a few within government that are attempting to keep a secret, and we are colluding with senior officials and politicians to keep that secret of so many years, while at the same time dealing an awful hand to those seeking justice and truth and to those who want to address an issue that should be addressed without all of these legal costs that are involved. This is all while the State hides behind this Attorney General's report. This issue is not about that report. This controversy is about what was not done by Ministers. I have never seen as many of the Gresham grandees run for cover. If there was an Olympic gold medal then each one of them would get one. They run for cover and pretend they did not hear it. They do not address it. It is a case of if you do not hear it you do not know about it. It was not true because Mary Harney stated in her contribution to the Seanad that, in fact, they all knew. Someone has to call a halt to all of this and restore the rights and dignity to people who are trying to get justice for themselves. I agree with Deputy O'Dowd's comments earlier that in spite of all the positive things we may have done for older people, they are the very cohort of people in society that are feeling the pinch of everything the hardest. It is unfair, it is unjust and I put it to the Minister that it is not good politics. It is not good politics to come in and attempt to defend the indefensible. Tell the truth and shame the devil.

The debate refers to people who really require access to care. They are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. My main concern is that these issues have been ongoing since first reported by the Office of the Attorney General in 2004. The high cost of nursing home care was highlighted at the time along with the lack of transparency in the pricing and payment systems. It also highlights the significant difference between the costs of different nursing homes with some charging significantly more than others for the same types of services. As a result of legal action taken at that time, public nursing home charges were stopped and funds could not be reclaimed until the President refused to sign the new legislation. At that stage a redress scheme was put in place for the repayment of public nursing home charges. The report at that time noted there were difficulties for older persons in securing funding for their care, with many having to sell their homes or use personal assets for their care. Where was the Department of Health in terms of its duty to our citizens? Despite the introduction of a number of measures, including the fair deal scheme, many nursing homes continue to be criticised for the lack of transparency when it comes to their fees and charges. Some families are reporting that they were unable to get the full extent of the costs until it was too late. Issues remain with the pricing framework, which is based on guidelines, including for the variation in the costs of care and services between different nursing homes. This needs to be addressed. Concerns continue to be raised about the quality care in nursing homes and the question of increased regulation of the industry to ensure residents receive high-quality care. This needs to be investigated further. Staffing levels also continue to be an area of focus in nursing homes when it comes to the provision of adequate care in this area. For example, are we introducing minimum staffing levels to ensure residents receive proper care? Issues were also raised within the Attorney General's report that highlight the need for increased oversight and regulation in nursing homes, as well as increased transparency and accountability in billing practice. The report also highlights the need for greater transparency for our elderly and families in the context of care homes, and especially those families who have limited financial resources. The impact of Covid-19 has been particularly difficult for older people and recent reports have demonstrated this. It has been very challenging for those who live on their own and those who reside in nursing homes. Learning from this, the Government needs to assess how we care for older people and examine alternatives to meet the diverse needs of our older citizens. I ask that we would move swiftly with the establishment of the commission to examine care and supports for elderly people to ensure that this is not delayed any further and to continue to demonstrate our seriousness about protecting our most vulnerable people.

Many of these people would have had profound disabilities and were relying on the State to care for them and advocate on their behalf. Instead of advocating for them the strategy of the Governments during this period, and by subsequent Governments, was to suppress advice coming to Cabinet that if those disabled people sued the State for payments their cases were likely to succeed. This affected thousands of people in up to 140 institutional care homes. It has been estimated that this affected between 4,000 and 10,000 people during the time the payment was made by the Department of Health, and affected another 2,700 people after the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as it was known, took over the payments. As shocking as they are, these revelations should not come as too big a surprise when we consider the other scandals involving successive Governments down through the years where they have tried to deny people their rights by concealing information and settling on the steps of the courts.I am thinking of those affected by thalidomide, sodium valproate, the CervicalCheck scandal, the mother and baby homes redress scheme, and of course, now, in respect of the nursing home fees. We need full disclosure and openness from the Government and from those who were in positions of power in respect of the Government’s heartless political strategy to withhold disability payments from those in residential care who were entitled to it and the subsequent concealment of that strategy by successive governments since. This must involve full co-operation and transparency from Government, including the acceptance of any requests from committees for Ministers to address the matter. The current Attorney General has concluded that the State had no positive legal duty to make retrospective payment on the disabled person’s maintenance allowance. This simply begs the question as to why the cases brought against the State were settled. The Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, in response to a question I raised on this issue yesterday, quoted from the Attorney General’s report, "It is sometimes tempting to resort to generic stereotypes about the State being in some way cruel or unfair to its citizens where they are deprived of a benefit and bring legal proceedings challenging this deprivation." The Minister of State went on to quote "the ... logic of such a perspective is that the State has unlimited resources, must concede every Court case that is brought against it, and must fund every claim for compensation or redress that is demanded of it". This misses the point or, more importantly, tries to deflect from it. Of course it is the case that not all challenges against the State are well founded and that the State has a right to defend itself against a legal challenge, and of course the State should protect the taxpayer. However, the advice coming to the Cabinet was that if those disabled people sued the State for payments, their cases were likely to succeed. If this had been a case of challenges which were unfounded, when the State had the opportunity to defend its decision, it decided to settle these cases at the court steps. As for protecting the taxpayer, it seems this is only of interest to the Government when it refers to vulnerable people. The State did not fight the church in court to get it to pay for all of the abuse it inflicted on children. It has not fought those who supplied faulty cement blocks or the builders of substandard apartments. In essence, what this and previous governments have done is to pay out to those with power and means, even if they are not primarily culpable, while denying payment to the weak, even when this obligation is utterly undeniable. Once again I reiterate what is needed is full disclosure and openness from Government and from those who were in positions of power in respect of this heartless political strategy from the Government which withheld disability payments from those in residential care who were entitled to it and the subsequent concealment of the strategy by successive governments since. This must involve full co-operation and transparency from the Government, including the acceptance of any request from committees for Ministers to address the matter. The Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, will review this, will look at all of the documentation and will come back to the House within three months. I hope they will be guided by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, to ensure the review is based on the rights of people with disabilities. We should not need a convention to tell us how disabled citizens are treated or should be treated. It is because of actions just like this by successive governments that we need a convention. Article 28 of the UNCRPD reads "States parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this right". There are other rights in the convention that guarantee legal capacity, a right to information and justice for persons with disabilities. All of those things have been denied to the people in this case but the Ministers have an opportunity now to correct the mistakes of the past and I ask them to please do that.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	261	I want to set out that this is no doubt quite a complicated issue, spans four or five decades and is somewhat opaque as to the interpretation of the care that should be given to our citizens. In this case we are talking about long-stay nursing home care. The central tenet to the critique the Attorney General has set out, and I and others would argue this point, is that those who had an obligation to receive care were subjected to an imposition of charges with regard to that care. That is, as I say, open to interpretation. Some families went to court and others did not and that was in respect of the resources of those families. There is no doubt that families went through very significant financial hardship in respect of those decades that have passed. It was policy to bring families through the courts and so be it. The report of the Attorney General, which I read this morning, and I do not generally read documents of that nature, says the Government’s position stands up legally, but I do not believe it stands up morally, where families were denied care that should be given to them. There has been a strategy by successive governments and by the Department of Health to counter litigation, and that could have a very detrimental effect on those families trying to seek justice and redress on this issue. Families were short-changed; of that there is no doubt. Also, however, in the public interest and in the public realm, society was also short-changed in respect of this entire issue, to say the least. Successive governments and Ministers have put compensation and redress at arm’s length, of which there is no doubt also. Looking at this objectively, families who should have been given this care and redress were made sweat and compensation was very difficult to obtain. We have seen wrongs in the State in how people were brought through the courts. To say the justice was arbitrary is an understatement. Were families let down? It is indisputable that they were. Whatever the Attorney General says, whatever successive Ministers have said, and whatever the Government says at the moment, families were let down in their time of need. When these families needed that help in respect of care, which is a simple obligation of the State, they were made pay both financially and in hardship terms. There are still a great number of questions in respect of this issue and families deserve those answers, not just over the next three months but over the lifetime of this Government.

They are still, however, members of the parties responsible for it. There are still in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, even though they are condemning the behaviour of Ministers and of previous parties for upholding what was done to people in nursing homes and people with disabilities or in long-term care. It is a scandal and will be remembered by the population. I suspect the reason these Deputies are so strong in their condemnation is because they understand that the older persons are the ones who vote. The grey vote is important to them and they do not want to lose it in their constituencies. It is a hypocrisy and the least they could do is to have a backbenchers’ revolt against the report of the Attorney General-----

That is the very least that they could do. Mairéad Enright said something very clear in her article in The Journal, that "the State is a peculiar ... defendant because it is the plaintiff’s protector as well as ... [the] opponent". That should mean the State must behave as a model litigant in cases against ordinary citizens but it has not. It has been said by all of the Deputies here that it has been a David and Goliath story where the State has taken on the most vulnerable, the weakest, the poorest, the sickest and the ones without the intellectual or physical ability to be able to challenge the State on an equal par.This is definitely the David and Goliath story of the century as far as the State is concerned, which has been repeated in other cases. I will reference what the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, stated:The line taken by the State to stop the disability maintenance payment on admission to long-term care and the subsequent legal approach and lack of State action to address the discrepancy is particularly distressing when the people affected were often living with significant disability and not in a position to advocate for themselves.[...]DFI is now calling for:The identification of ... [the 12,000 or so who are] impacted through the planned review.  ... this number ... [can] be confirmed ... [through] historical records.[A] Trust [needs] to be established ... [through] this process and ... undertaken in a transparent and timely way with appropriate communication ... [to] those [who are] impacted [and their families]. An examination of ... [this] issue ... handled in the intervening years [has been inadequate].A process of statutory repayment [needs to be put in place]. Deputy Tully came up with a great idea. Let the State pursue those who manufactured defective blocks, and who gave us more than 100,000 apartments and homes and the mica scandal in County Donegal. The Government should pursue them and get the cash it is so preciously minding on behalf of the taxpayer back into the coffers of the State so it can look after people with disabilities and people too old and sick to defend themselves in nursing homes. Let the State pursue the religious orders and the church, which have underpaid by a huge amount their alleged, supposed and requested contribution to the redress scheme for historical abuse cases. That is a brilliant idea. If the State did that, it would prove itself not to be a Goliath but that it is trying to treat equally all people and all the children of the nation who live in this State. However, that is not going to happen. The Minister and I, and everybody else in the House, know it will not happen. Instead, the Attorney General, in the most class-biased report of any from the State, made not just a legal but political defence of the legacy we are talking about. He said the State litigation strategy it had to have to protect the State coffers is not sinister or abnormal in any way. If a secret litigation strategy was used against vulnerable and poor people, and it is not abnormal, then it must be normal. If it is normal, then that is a huge class bias fault on the part of the State against the people who dwell in this country. The Attorney General went on to say: "Any suggestion that a "secret litigation strategy" ... is in some way improper betrays significant unfamiliarity with the civil litigation process". Of course it does. I am a Deputy but I am not familiar with the civil litigation process. How is somebody with an intellectual or physical disability, or with Alzheimer's or dementia who is living in a nursing home, meant to be familiar with the civil litigation process? The State has gone beyond what it tries to do in these instances. When the Taoiseach said we did not have a legal leg to stand on, he was absolutely right. When questioned, the Government says the State had a responsibility to do what is right but it also had to protect the taxpayer and a balance had to be struck between the past and the future. The balance has not been struck. I hope the Government will fall over on both legs in losing its balance because what it has done here is outrageous, as is the fact it is standing over it. I hope those grey voters and others bring the chickens home to roost and put it out of office.

It was a policy to attempt to accommodate people who had no hope of getting accommodation and had no accommodation available to them anywhere. As long as public hospitals, with spaces, were available in places such as Naas, Athy and so on and so forth, with a need for more, those hospitals were able to accommodate those patients for as long as was necessary. A number of other places, such as Peamount Hospital, did the same thing.

It may be that it could or could not be reviewed but the situation always applied. I understand why the Opposition sees this as an opportunity to scourge members of the Government as being in some way responsible for concocting this out of their evil minds. We can then look back and claim against everybody. The whole country will eventually end up claiming for something that should have been done at the time for want of there being a policy in place to deal with it. What then happened was the excess accommodation required was dealt with by the health boards by way of applying for beds in private nursing homes. Only the overspill was then transferred to the private sector in a way that would meet accommodation requirements. It was not always sufficient but it was an attempt to deal with a situation that was running out of control. We can say otherwise in retrospect but it should not be forgotten that retrospection applies to everything that any government did in any case. We need to realise that. In that situation, we were not the richest country in the world as we claim to be now. We are still not but we certainly were not at that stage. An attempt was made to accommodate people and a charge was applied by the health boards for nursing homes. The reason for that was there were complaints from members of the public who said that some people were making a profit off the situation that was in operation. I do not know whether they were but all we could do at that particular time was try to accommodate people's needs as they were at that stage, where they might not have had anybody to look after them. When a situation arose where nobody was around to look after the family, something had to be done. A charge was then thought of, similar to the old age pension, or part or three quarters of it or whatever, in return for which pocket money was given to patients at the time. As the Ceann Comhairle will recall, we objected to that at the time. It seemed punitive but there was no other way of getting the accommodation at that time. We were between a rock and a hard place. I am not accepting responsibility for one moment for Government policy because, at that stage, I was a backbencher almost all of the time. However, I was a member of the health board and subject to its policy.

It would be nice if we could silence everybody who had an opposing view but I believe in the democratic way. It is the oldest and still the best way. We then went on to a situation whereby, as the problem got bigger, there was a necessity to increase the charge. Otherwise, the system would have collapsed and we would not have been in a position to supply any service. By "we" I mean the people whose board I sat on - the health board - and the Government backbenchers. I do not mind accepting full responsibility for those things but we have to view them in the light of circumstances prevailing at that time and not in light of current circumstances, which are totally and absolutely different. Members of the Opposition will continue to say the Government does not know what it is talking about. Maybe they are right but that could apply to everybody in the House. Maybe they are also right and maybe they are not. The fact remains that we have the right to speak. We arrived at the situation - Sinn Féin introduced this first - where there was a campaign, not so much on the need for but the fairness of having a charge for accommodation. It transpired there was no legislation to enable the charges to be made. That is fair enough but it did not previously stop charges from being made.The legislation was produced and it was then possible to charge but what nobody has spoken about, the Opposition or anyone else, is that the alternative system was far more costly. The fair deal scheme was introduced in more recent times to try to accommodate the situation arising. It does no harm to remember. Situations like this will always be used by the Opposition, whatever its hue, to blame the Government of the day and previous Governments. If, however, we have arrived at a situation whereby in future we will examine our conscience and decide to address retrospectively every injustice that has been done, there will be a lot of time spent on that, and we better realise that. In another Department, I had responsibility for a different situation. You could, for example, qualify for a contributory old-age pension if you had in excess of 21 years' contributions. Therefore, if you had 19 years' contributions you got no pension. If you had 21 years' contributions you got 98% of the pension. I thought that was unfair. I believe I was right and I was in a position to do something about it. Specifically, I was a Minister of State in that Department and I said I wanted to do something about it, having tabled countless questions about it in the House. I had all the information on cost. I remember well that the first information I got was that it would cost £700 million, a lot of money at that time, to change it. There were not too many people ponying up or making offers to concede in order to provide for the £700 million. I tried that for a couple of years. It did not work and I had no success. Then I did my own review, in my own country way, as we do down in the country, as you will know, a Cheann Comhairle, and I came up with a different assessment of the cost. I came up with an assessment that was not £700 million or £800 million but a simple £14 million. I had erred on the conservative side because, in fact, it was costing only £9 million. I am not saying I was right or wrong, but we changed the system at the time for £9 million. We did so because we were able to explain that the situation was such that the people would gain and society would gain as a result of the decision to deal with it now and to introduce a pro rata pension in order that if you had 70% of the contributions, you got 70% of the pension. Try it in any court of law you want; it will stand up. If you had 50% of the contributions, you got 50% of the pension. There were those who said at the time that 50% was no good. It is a lot better than nothing, and that is a fact. That still stands. I say this by way of illustration of the circumstances that prevailed during the times with which everybody else is now familiar, and we have to recall them, but that is the situation we were in at that time. We do not claim any responsibility for doing what was deemed to be the right thing to do, and we probably would not have got any credit for it, but the fact of the matter is that things like that happen every day to every Government of every hue. The Attorney General, to my mind, is right. We have to have the moral consideration on the one hand and, on the other, the recognition of the factual situation in respect of two things: the setting of a precedent and the cost. Those things have to be borne in mind always in government. If a Minister, a Deputy or anybody else wishes to go beyond that, and if the question is then raised as to how satisfactorily they intend to deal with the situation when it arises, they are always asked, if setting a precedent, whether they are happy to be blamed for that precedent. If they set a bad precedent, how will that fit? If they spend money in a way that is not as it should be, the examination of which is a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, who seems to have a view on these things as well, there are repercussions. We had better realise that this situation is very sensitive, very important and genuine. Hardships were caused as a result of decisions taken at that time but when we resolve them we want to resolve them in such a way that will stand up. The last point I will make is about a different subject, about which I have heard several times in the House. I do not understand why the Opposition has raised it. I refer to the question of the wrongdoings relating to the mother and baby homes and the church's responsibility in that regard. Let us not forget that society had a responsibility as well. Society, in particular, took an interest in what was happening and allowed it to happen and walked away. It was society not only in this country but in adjoining countries as well. When we criticise others we have to look at ourselves as well and ask ourselves how that fit with society at the time. The answer to that question is simply this: society went along with it. That is what happened, and the mothers and daughters will tell us that to this day. To be fair to us all, we should recognise that that was not an easy time - not in this country. There are those who say that it happened only in this country. It did not; it happened in every country to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, when we criticise all those who are responsible we should not exclude society, all of us.

An American writer, Pearl Buck, wrote "Our society must make it right and possible for old people not to fear the young or be deserted by them, for the test of a civilization is in the way that it cares for its helpless members." It is clear from this scandal that this Government is failing that test. This scandal is very much a symptom of successive uncaring Governments, under which our older people have been disgracefully treated. As with housing, our health service and even the refugees we have coming in, our older people are treated as commodities from which to make profit. Our older people need an ombudsman of their own who will stand up for their rights and represent them in respect of public policy. They were wrongfully charged for nursing home care. Up to 12,000 people with disabilities living in residential care had their disability allowance payments illegally taken from them. Under laws passed in 1970, older people who were eligible for medical cards were entitled to a place in a nursing home free of charge. Some of those people, however, were placed in private nursing homes as there were no spaces available in public facilities. They were charged for their care. Conveniently for this Government, charging for care became legal in 2005. Documents exposed by whistleblower Shane Corr show that the Government undertook a legal strategy in order that it did not have to refund fully those affected. The Department of Health settled cases out of court and paid between 40% and 60% of these claims. The strategy saw the State resisting claims until the last possible opportunity. Many people were put off by the potential cost of vindicating their rights. That means that only those who had the finances to persist with a legal case would be able to get refunds. It also meant they never got a full refund. Thousands of vulnerable people who should have received payments were denied them due to a policy of secrecy put in place by successive Governments to cover up their involvement. This was most recently affirmed in 2017 by the Ministers, Deputies Harris and McEntee, when they were in the Department of Health. When Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour were bankrupting our country to pay billions to junior bondholders, they could not find any money for families who were wrongfully charged or people with disabilities from whom they took allowances. So much for Labour's way and not Frankfurt's, but what can we expect from a Government that removed the bereavement grant? That was yet another example of the Government putting corporate interests above the interests of workers and families and older people, and it is an absolute disgrace. Successive Governments led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael conspired to deny our older people their entitlements. The State settled 80 legal actions over refunds for nursing home fees in a four-year period between 2013 and 2016. Forty-nine settlements were negotiated by Fine Gael Deputy Colm Burke on behalf of clients of his legal practice.We are seeing a drip-feed of information, with new revelations every couple of days. This debate should have included a question-and-answer session but that would not have helped the Government in its efforts to cover up its shady role in this scandal. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts must examine the issues in detail to get to the bottom of this sordid affair.  The Government developed a legal strategy in order that it would not have to reimburse nursing home residents and their families in instances where they did not have to pay fees. Rather than putting in place a fair redress scheme to address financial hardship caused by the Government's heartless policy, as recommended by the Ombudsman in 2011, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil continued to fight the families. The Taoiseach and senior Ministers in successive Governments have questions to answer. People are angry. Does the Minister for Health want the truth? Does he want those questions to be answered?  Two weeks ago, I went to a presentation by Care Champions on nursing homes and Covid within the nursing home sector. The nursing home sector is looking for a public inquiry and I am waiting, with bated breath, for a date. I hope we get it soon.

First, I want to commend those who have helped to bring it to light, which has allowed us to discuss it in this fashion today. What is involved here is the State bullying into submission those who could not afford the risk of high legal fees to seek justice and compensation, those who were wrongly charged but either did not have the means or the knowledge to go about seeking redress. Instead of protecting and serving them, we have politicians and officials strewn throughout this debacle trying to manipulate these people into silence and submission. I have read the Attorney General's report a number of times but it is fair to say my concerns have not been alleviated by it. Its second paragraph states "This account has accordingly had to be prepared on the basis of documentation readily available, and within a very compressed period of time." What documentation was readily available and more importantly, what documentation exists that was not readily available to the Attorney General? In paragraph No. 9, the Attorney General states the "period of time covered by the issues of controversy addressed in this Report includes an era in which the Government’s finances were very strained". Apart from the fact that the strain on the Government's finances at the time is irrelevant, how much did it cost in legal fees to settle these cases? In paragraph No. 13, the Attorney General states "Paying for the choice by citizens to take up beds in private nursing homes was, put simply, a benefit that the State never agreed to provide for its citizens, and legislation passed by the Oireachtas in 2006 and 2009 reflected this policy choice". In his report, the Attorney General is suggesting that the cases at the heart of this issue arose out of a choice to go into private care but it is my understanding, and that of everyone involved, that some people ended up in being placed in a private nursing home because the State was unable to provide a place in a public one. A test case has not been determined or even brought before the courts.  In paragraph No.14, the Attorney General states "the irresistible logic of such a perspective is that the State has unlimited resources, must concede every Court case that is brought against it, and must fund every claim for compensation or redress that is demanded of it". This is not a typical compensation case, nor is it a typical case for redress and it should not be framed as such. It is a case where the charges were taken in a way they should not have been taken and where, at a later date, the Government was prevented by the Supreme Court from making changes retrospectively in legislation to make those charges legal. By no means is this a typical compensation or redress issue.  Paragraphs Nos. 95 to 98 highlight the fact that in 2004 the Government sought to validate the maintenance charges which health boards had imposed. The only reason the Government would seek to do so in 2004 is because those charges were previously invalid. The health boards had been acting ultra vires. This in itself is an admission that the charges should never have been taken from people in the manner in which they were. Paragraph No. 171 references the "safeguarding" of public moneys. This phrase is disingenuous and is a most disingenuous way of describing the situation. This is not typically compensation or redress and should not be framed as such. This is about moneys illegally gathered by the State that should have just been paid back. There should not have been a debate about it. The strategy is a common one, as we now know, within the mysterious workings and back streets of Government Departments, with files that are labelled secret. If this is a regularly used strategy, let us hope that others will have the bravery and wherewithal to come out, blow the whistle and shine a light on it.  Unfortunately, the Attorney General's report merely raises more questions than it answers. I will be calling for an independent inquiry to be established into this whole affair if the three months of discussions in the interim do not provide the answers. It is an extraordinary day when the Government seeks to hide behind the Statute of Limitations to deny the most vulnerable in society what is rightfully theirs. The Statute of Limitations is a bargain basement defence that should be afforded to the most marginalised in society, not one that big Government can rely on to screw poor Joe and Mary. The Attorney General's opinion may be legally correct as of today but it is morally reprehensible and one given through a rear-view mirror. Relying on the Statute of Limitations in today's realm leaves me without words.  As Fintan O'Toole put it in The Irish Times on Tuesday, the "Department of Health did not challenge those who refused to pay nursing home fees" but "hammered only those who were too poor to hire a lawyer". Most of the people affected by these charges are no longer with us but they have family members and loved ones who had to pay through the nose, in many cases, and rid themselves of assets to provide for the care of their loved ones. They deserve to be treated with dignity and respect but at the moment, the State is not treating them thus.

Although the issue is years old, it is the current Government that is now tasked with allaying public anger. How that plays out now rests primarily with the two relevant Ministers that have been asked to conduct a review. Their report and proposals will be crucial to how the Government is judged on this issue. The Attorney General’s report sets out the legal facts, concluding that successive Governments acted prudently but the question remains as to whether the decisions taken during that time were morally right. It is the official response to this question that will cement opinion. While we await the response and possible proposals from the Ministers, the ongoing fight for the survival of private nursing homes remains a serious issue. Many are clinging on by their fingertips as they battle to make ends meet. Rising costs across the board forced the closure of 17 private nursing homes throughout last year, resulting in the loss of approximately 500 jobs. The disruption to families and the heartbreak caused to the elderly residents who were forced to leave the place they called home is immeasurable. Nursing home owners across Tipperary predict that national closures will significantly increase by the end of this current year. Nursing home owners are burdened with doubt and worry about the future. It is now a fact that there is no surplus profit to meet the enormous increases in day-to-day costs or to satisfy HIQA demands and compliance standards. Not only will this result in a huge gap in the availability of nursing home care, it will also make hundreds more people dependent on social welfare payments.  Last December, Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, which represents private nursing homes, lodged a complaint with the European Commission because its members they felt their voice was not being heard by the Government. NHI alleges discrimination by the State under the fair deal scheme in the resourcing of private nursing home resident care as opposed to public nursing home resident care.At present, public nursing homes, run and staffed by the HSE, receive 62% more per resident per week than what is available to pay for the care of an elderly person in a private nursing home. This equates to €627 per week more to provide nursing home care to a person in a public nursing home as compared with a person in a private one. It is on this basis that Nursing Homes Ireland made its case to EU competition officials. Private nursing home owners have been asked to do the impossible for years. The rising costs for heating, lighting and food have made their hard-fought battle a lost cause. Better pay in public nursing homes means that staff, particularly essential healthcare assistants who account for half of the employees, leave the private homes if given the chance to work in public nursing homes. Few could dispute that, from a business perspective, this situation is unsustainable for private nursing home owners. Hospital overcrowding has thrown the spotlight on the importance of nursing homes. These facilities are equipped to provide step-down, respite, rehabilitation and a continuation of care to many elderly people who no longer need to be hospitalised. Last month a survey showed that 70% of the country's 440 private and voluntary nursing homes have capacity to facilitate discharges from hospitals. This allows for a faster turnover of hospital beds. We all hear about the problems and the difficulties we have in our acute hospitals in particular, where patients are discharged from the hospital but there is no facility available for a step down. Eighty per cent of nursing home beds are in the private sector. If increasing numbers of private nursing homes are forced to close their doors because they cannot meet costs, the pressure will remain on hospitals to provide prolonged care. It is logical and sensible to provide the nursing home sector with sufficient funding to allow it to provide its vital service. I would ask that rather than wait for the European Commission to make a decision on the complaint that has been made, the Minister should sit with the private nursing home representatives, thrash out the issues and the concerns that they have, come to a conclusion and secure the future of private nursing homes for the people, particularly those who I represent in rural Ireland in Tipperary.

I might focus on the nursing home charges first. As I understand it, this issue originally arose out of the Health Act 1970, which granted people with a medical card free access to inpatient services. This was later determined to include long-stay nursing home care. However, in 1976, the then health boards withdrew medical cards for those in long-term care. This resulted in those patients and their families making contributions for long-term care between 1976 and 2004. In 2004, the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, introduced the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 in an attempt to resolve the issue. However this Bill was referred to the Supreme Court. The court found patients who had been unlawfully charged for services had the right under Article 43 of the Constitution, which deals with private property, and Article 40.3.2°, which deals with the vindication of rights, to sue to recover damages. In its judgment, the court found that elements of the Bill represented an unjust attack on the property rights of individuals and therefore were repugnant to the Constitution. However, in its judgment the court only dealt with patients in public care homes. The court did not deal with medical card patients or people eligible for a medical card who could not secure a bed in a public facility and had to go to private nursing home care. In response, the then Government introduced the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 to provide a legal basis for the repayment of long-stay charges which had been imposed on persons with full eligibility since 1976, that is, those persons who had a medical card or who were entitled to a medical card and in a public facility. The scheme entitled people in a public facility since 1998 who were still alive in December 2004 to recoup payments back to 1998, that is, within the six-year Statue of Limitations. Estates were given similar status. The HSE was also given power to reclaim funds to third-party institutions for people in their care with no families. The deadline for submitting claims under the health repayment scheme was 31 December 2007. I understand approximately 35,000 applications were received under the health repayment scheme and almost 20,000 claimants received a repayment. This issue arose at the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member last week where we engaged with the HSE on this matter. A total of €486 million was paid out, with an average repayment of approximately €22,000. As I previously noted, the repayment scheme did not make provision for medical card patients, or those with eligibility who could not secure a bed in a public facility and had to go to access a private nursing home. Individuals and their families who accessed private nursing home care during the period from 1976 to 2004, had to take legal action if they wished to press their case. I understand proceedings were issued in a number of cases. In each instance, it has been reported the case was settled at discovery stage. We have advice from the Attorney General now that defends previous Government policy in dealing with the cases. The issue raises important questions, however, about the rights of vulnerable individuals and their families and the need for the State to protect the public purse to safeguard funds to provide important services. I understand almost all historical cases have been settled at this stage and the health repayment scheme is close to winding down. Of course, the fair deal scheme deals with the current arrangements. We all engage with that on a regular basis. In these circumstances, the issue is one of examining how we deal with current and future instances of citizens' access to courts and how the State vindicates the citizens' rights. Personally, I believe an ex-gratia or administrative scheme would have been fair but I recognise this issue came to a head from 2009 to 2011, a period when public funding was extremely tight. Notwithstanding this, it is important the State examines how it treats citizens and service users right across its Departments and agencies. A stand-alone inquiry is not required but it should be dealt with as part of a wider exercise. We need to provide additional funding to the Office of the Ombudsman. On another committee of which I am a member, we deal with the Ombudsman's office on a regular basis. Some of its staff would highlight the fact that there is a need to broaden their scope somewhat. This case highlights that need clearly. We also need to overhaul civil legal aid to support citizens and service users who wish to vindicate their rights. I appreciate the Minister's attendance here today. I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will make closing remarks. There have been discussions and debate, both in this House and outside, over the past couple of weeks on this sensitive issue. It is one that people obviously feel strongly about. I welcome the candid nature of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in terms of dealing with this issue. It is not easy looking back on historical issues, as we know in this House all too well. Nonetheless, the Minister and the Minister of State are determined to see it through and to ensure that there is a more transparent way in future for those who are in those positions. Obviously, legislation itself has changed, which is most welcome.

Of course, he was talking about the use of billions of euro of Irish taxpayers' money being used to bail out unsecured bank bondholders, because the Government of Ireland does not always pay its debts and, certainly, not when it comes to ordinary citizens. In fact, a rule of thumb that can be ascribed to successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments is that the more vulnerable those who are wronged are, the greater the battle they will have in securing redress.Just eight days before the Secretary General of the Department of Finance announced that the Government "pays its debts", a secret memo was circulated to Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers. It set out a political and legal strategy that amounted to a cover-up, denying citizens of Ireland due recourse to the recovery of moneys that were illegally taken from them. It is a familiar story and, shamefully, an all-too-familiar strategy: the treatment of Brigid McCole, who was dragged through the courts in her final months; Vicky Phelan and the other brave CervicalCheck victims, who stood up to attempts to bully them into silence; Louise O'Keefe; the thalidomide survivors; families affected by sodium valproate; and, more recently, the denial of redress to survivors of mother and baby homes. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have continued heartless, callous and morally wrong strategies to deny the most vulnerable their rights.

Not in this case, though. In this case, current members of the Government are implicated: the Tánaiste; the Taoiseach; the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris; and the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy McEntee. Right across the current Cabinet are politicians who had a responsibility to care for and protect the most vulnerable in society but who instead implemented and stood over a cruel and callous strategy aimed at denying our elderly and citizens with disabilities what they were rightfully owed. Now we have the scandalous scenario of the Ministers, Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Humphreys, doubling down in defence of the indefensible instead of rowing back on a despicable policy. What does this indefensible Government strategy amount to? In one stark example, we learned from the secret 2011 Government memo that residents of long-term disability homes were told by the Government that they were not eligible for the long-stay repayment scheme. Regardless, some applied for it and were swiftly denied. Most did not appeal because the HSE and the Government told them they would be unsuccessful. However, appeals were made on behalf of 515 such residents. Those appeals were successful. Eventually, the Government decided not to pursue a High Court case. The appeals officer had determined that those residents qualified for the scheme. The secret Government memo acknowledged that there had been no legal basis for them to be charged. Every single resident of such a facility was entitled to a refund, but the Government quietly refunded just the 515 who had appealed. It did not refund those who had applied but had not appealed or those who had not applied because they had been told they would not be successful. Since 2011 at the latest, every Taoiseach and Minister for Health has known that there are thousands of citizens with profound disabilities - the most vulnerable of all our citizens - who are owed money by the State and has hidden that fact from them and their advocates. Shame on each of those taoisigh and Ministers. Shame on the Ministers who came to the House today to stand over such actions. According to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, it appears that no one in government has ever even sought clarification as to how many of these residents are owed money, let alone made any effort to redress them. Unfortunately, the Government does not pay its debts when it comes to our elderly and citizens with disabilities, who have been let down for too long. We in Sinn Féin will not let this matter drop until the principles of justice and fairness are at the heart of how the Government responds to this issue and the money taken from citizens with disabilities who were residents of so-called section 38 and 39 homes and are entitled to full refunds is rightfully handed back to them.

It was not the first time, and I am sure it will not be the last. Thankfully, the exposing of this issue by a whistleblower, Mr. Shane Corr, has resulted in it coming to light and shown the true extent of the charges and the impact they have had on the lives of patients. But for a whistleblower, where would we be? No matter how the Government dresses this up, the fact is that the overcharging of vulnerable patients in nursing homes between the 1970s and the 2000s was a wrong, devastating and shocking exploitation of some of the most vulnerable members of society, namely, elderly and disabled people. The issue was covered up by successive Governments has only added to the hurt and anger of those affected. The system that served those Governments must take some responsibility, including Secretaries General and everyone else receiving such large remunerations. We now know that more than 300 legal cases have been taken relating to the State's handling of nursing home fees. The matter has dominated the political agenda since the Irish Mail on Sunday first reported on a secret internal Government document that detailed the strategy to minimise the cost to the State. Imagine there being such a document. This year, we will be commemorating the 100th anniversary of people who gave their lives to free our country, such as Mr. Liam Lynch in a number of week's time, yet this is how we have been treating citizens. How more callous could a system be? I support other Deputies in their comments on the disparity between private and public nursing homes. Public nursing homes are getting more than €620 per week more to cater for each patient than a private one does. This is a significant discrimination. Private nursing homes have had to ask the European Commission for justice. They have been lobbying Irish Governments. There are many of them in my county, for example, in Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel, Thurles, Templemore, Nenagh and Lorrha. They are under savage pressure due to the cost-of-living crisis and the staffing crisis, under which they are trying to retain staff. Public nursing homes can pay staff better and give them greater job security because of a discriminatory practice favoured by the Government. This is a shocking situation that must be rectified. I am sure the European Commission will find in their favour, but the Government will be dragged kicking and screaming to it again. We know that successive Governments before 2011 and up to the present devised and applied a strategy to deny refunds to people who were "illegally charged" nursing home fees. The State faced the prospect of paying €12 billion in compensation to hundreds of thousands of families wrongly charged for the care of their loved ones over a 30-year period. The central allegation in this scandal is that the Government, even knowing that it could not win in court, sought to contest the cases and only settled when people proceeded with legal actions. I would love to know what the State has been paying in legal costs. We have the experience of the late Vicky Phelan and many others who had to drag the State through the courts. We all stood up and made glowing tributes to her after she died. This is a shocking indictment of what is supposed to be a democratically accountable Government. This controversy has stretched over 30 years. Successive Governments and health bosses have been found to have failed to remedy the grounds for the illegal charges imposed on mostly older people. How many people are involved and how much will it cost? According to the document, the State's exposure could be as large as €12 billion. By 2011, up to 70,000 people were considered eligible for refunds. In the end, though, 35,000 applications were received and the State paid out €486 million on almost 20,000 cases through the health repayment scheme, HRS. This meant that approximately 15,000 applicants were refused refunds point blank. Where is the compassion, empathy and respect for elderly citizens? They are the people who built this country and gave us the life we have today. They worked hard, paid their taxes and raised their families when they did not have much and did not ask for much. Unfortunately, they would still be at home if they had been in a position to remain in their homes. The Government has stated the issue has been "grossly misrepresented". However, this assertion is nothing more than a tactic to hide the facts and cover up the wrongs of this diabolical overcharging scandal, which had the full consent of many Ministers for Health, including the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach when they were in the Department of Health. The Taoiseach has serious questions to answer about his personal involvement as Minister for Health into the secret nursing home changing scandal, which was designed to subvert the rights of citizens to natural justice.That is what it was. Anyone who knew about it should also be aware of that. It was designed to subvert the natural justice rights of citizens. The more than 300,000 vulnerable elderly residents directly impacted, many of whom have since passed away - Lord rest them - and their respective families who suffered extreme financial hardship because of actions of consecutive Ministers for Health must be told the truth. The Attorney General was due to produce a report for the Cabinet this week. That report should be made public and should have been provided to all Members of the Oireachtas ahead of this debate. We did not get it. It will probably never see the light of day. We need to know if the Attorney General's report is meaningful or merely an attempt by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party to remove the heat from this diabolical scandal, by kicking it onto the Attorney General for cover. Many Attorneys General have looked at this. The office and all the teams there must take some responsibility. One cannot be hiding behind the other. Depriving those affected of their legal entitlement to full reimbursement is heartless and cruel. Failure to come clean and to deny these families the truth is abhorrent and sinister, especially as this heartless legal strategy needed the approval of the serving Minister for Health. We need to know if the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and other serving Ministers in the current Cabinet agreed to extending this disrespectful and deceitful practice. Clearly, the Taoiseach’s explanation of his involvement in this cruel scandal is not credible. This disgusting issue has been swept under the carpet for too long. The public must be provided with transparency, openness, and accountability which we hear so much about. We have millions of euro and teams of spin doctors to get the message out and to spin. How can anyone have faith in the system that serves us when this is going on and with what is going on with the banking scandal? Who paid the piper there? The ordinary people were made to carry the can. The bondholders and junior bondholders who had insurance bonds on their lending - it was reckless lending - got off scot-free. We sided with the bankers. One of the last acts of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Finance before he left to become Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform was to give back bonuses to a cohort of bankers who needed it badly because they only earn €1 million or so a year. We then have a cohort of ordinary people who we all stood and clapped for, such as nurses, people working in nursing homes and care attendants, many of whom work for agencies and who still have not received the widely acclaimed €1,000 we were to give them for dedicated service. Why are we discriminating against citizens who are care assistants and nurses in nursing homes and other private settings when we were supposed to give the payment to everyone in healthcare? Why did we announce it with such fanfare if we did not have the money to pay for it or the goodwill to honour the announcement? We make contracts with people and it is a two-way street. People give a service and they do their best. Déanann siad a ndícheall. They gave great service and now they are ringing my office and those of all Deputies every week to know when they are getting the payment they were promised. Many of them took a well-deserved break or perhaps bought something for the house on the strength of it and they are still waiting for it. Will they be waiting like the people who are waiting to get their money back? How long more will the Government keep them waiting? Will they be waiting until the cows come home? Where is the respect for these staff, these families, for people with disabilities, for the elderly and vulnerable people who the Government wrongfully charged this money and then fought through the courts? It is not apparent in this House. It has not been apparent in successive Governments and it is getting worse by the week.

I know he is passionate about what he is trying to do and achieve. Sometimes it might feel as though he is almost a punch bag for everything that goes wrong with the delivery of the service. In that regard I have some sympathy for him. However, the reality is that when things go wrong or even if there is a perception that things are awry there is an all consuming fear and suspicion that the State has failed society at large. As the Minister is well aware, the reality is that we have thousands of staff across the Departments of Health and of Social Protection and multiple other government agencies who work day in, day out, with the best of intentions and are singular in their commitment to deliver first class services. There is no public or civil servant who does not strive to deliver the best for their neighbours and community. It is a deeply laudable trait and that same tenacity and commitment needs to be reflected in the State approach. I accept the Minister has a difficult task here today but the reality is that the public at large does not have the time, inclination or energy to drill into the minutiae of the cases and certainly would feel overwhelmed by the legalese of the Attorney General's considered opinion in these matters. I accept the State and various Governments pursued a policy for 15 to 20 years, largely on the basis that it was their considered opinion that medical card holders did not have an entitlement to free private nursing home care. I also accept that a limited number of cases were settled over the course of ten years where there were complicating factors. While no case ever proceeded to a hearing, the State has said it would have defended its position and would have had bona fide defences prepared in these instances. The key point for the Minister and for us as a Government here is that the State would have defended its position and had defences prepared. The situation of the disability allowance payments is similar where the Attorney General found that there was no positive legal duty to make retrospective payments. The phrase "positive legal duty to make retrospective payments" does not inspire and does not ooze empathy. It rings hollow, lacks empathy and while technically and legally correct, it is not the message those who are suffering and battling against multiple odds needed to hear or need to hear now nor, in many cases, what their families need to hear. The reality is that despite the Minister's earnest and heartfelt efforts and those of the people who work in the aforementioned Departments, the public still feels that we are too adversarial and that the State instantly retrenches to a line of defence. The experience of the past two weeks and the battle scars from the medical card and disability payment debacles should teach us as a government that we must embrace empathy. We cannot, as a society or as a Government, instantly retrench to a position of safeguarding the State's interests and coffers, as laudable as that idea or notion might be in some corridors of power and financial prudence. There is an awful lot of anger and the slightest of perceptions can trigger ire. Vested interest groups, be they opposition parties or increasingly radical elements in our society will use this to their advantage. Regrettably it is driving a deep wedge into the heart of our country and somehow we need to take stock and find a way to allow us to simply do things better as a society and as a Government. In many instances, much like the medical cards and disability payments, it is simply a matter of communicating better, engaging with people and steadfastly abandoning what seems to be a default position of stand and fight in some Government quarters when things look wrong. We need to talk to people, we need to communicate better and we need to stop festering and fertilising deeply emotive issues that challenge the public's faith in the national agencies. In my time in public office I increasingly find that if something was not done last year, was not done before or in the recent past, there is a deep reluctance to tackle the issue or try something different. It is almost a default position for the agencies of the State. Much of this fear on the part of staff might be due to living in an era of accountability and that is right. However, ultimately nothing should ever trump the need and requirement to do what is right for our people. A case in point is that of Jonatan Safiak, an eleven year old boy from Longford town. He struggled with his health from the age of four months and his mother, Aneta, began a tireless tour of consultants and specialists to try to find out what was wrong. The most recent estimate is that they may have attended up to 40 different doctors and specialists.The ultimate breakthrough came when the family visited Nottingham last year and met a team of specialists at the epicentre of the treatment in the UK for ataxia telangiectasia, AT, a very rare disease. In March last year we got that diagnosis. It is an extremely rare disorder which affects the nervous and immune systems and many other essential bodily functions. Unfortunately, people with the condition rarely live beyond 19 to 25 years of age, although there are some exceptions who live into their 50s. The kernel of the issue is that the condition is going to cause Jonatan and a small handful of other children who have a similar diagnosis in this country to lose their ability to walk. It will also significantly increase their chances of getting cancer during what is a very short life expectancy.  An Irish doctor is working on a groundbreaking treatment trial in Australia. While the scale and pace of the treatment for AT is somewhat more advanced in the UK, it has not as yet embraced the Australian trial. I understand a similar trial is under way in Germany, with a plant-based treatment which poses no physical to the patient. It is very much a case of managing the disease in these quarters, rather than curing it, because the general consensus is that there is no cure. Unfortunately, we do not provide treatment for rare diseases very well in Ireland. I admit we are a small country, but that should not define us - and some might say it should inspire us. The reality is that teams across the world working on AT, including those in Australia, Germany or the UK, count among them many Irish people who are leading the charge in treatment of and research into this disease. I accept that the number of children in Ireland with an AT diagnosis could be as low as five, but each case is heartbreaking and behind each case is a child and family desperately hoping against hope. We are soon to open one of the finest children's hospital in the world. It can be a beacon for child healthcare worldwide. Unfortunately, there are many other Jonatan Safiaks and those who have little known, but equally challenging, diseases and conditions.  We need to do better when it comes to treating rare diseases in this country and we need to make a much easier for families to access care and treatment outside the country. Time and again, when the country presses the empathy button nobody does empathy better. Empathy is much more than a virtue; it should define and underline how we function as a State and treat our citizens, especially those struggling with ill-health. We also need to be more innovative in the delivery of our healthcare system at home. As we look to the opening of a new dedicated children's hospital, could we not look at an immunology-led team to take on the Australian inspired AT trial in Ireland? It would require six-week cycles in hospital for, at most, three to five children at any one time. Crucially, it could prolong their fragile life expectancy by several years. I have the utmost and highest respect for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I believe there is no one more passionate or wholehearted in this country at the present time about delivering a better health service that befits us as a modern, progressive and compassionate nation. We need to stop being so adversarial and take better care of the Jonatans of this world. I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in Jonatan's case in the hope that we somehow can provide his parents and siblings with a torch to guide them through what seems to be a very tense and never-ending fog.

The fact remains that thousands of people who were entitled to State care were denied it. This was covered up, and when it came out successive Governments, led by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Labour Party, did everything possible to make sure those people got nothing back. The Attorney General's report may be a useful political tool to hide behind, but it does not take away from the facts. The Government did not break the law; rather, it fought tooth and nail to stop redress for thousands of people who were saddled with massive costs they should never have had to pay.  The Taoiseach spoke with a forked tongue in the Dáil yesterday about how it takes two sides to agree to settle in an attempt to portray this as a level playing field. We know that is not the case. We know from the documents released by Shane Corr that the State was looking for a strong test case it could win in court in order to try to put all of this to bed.  The State's legal team waited up to the point of disclosure and weighed up the case before offering an out-of-court settlement. It knew exactly what it was doing. How could ordinary people feel they could face up to a State legal power when faced with strategies like this? How many mother and baby home survivors, people who suffered abuse in church or State care, people denied care in their old age, those with a disability or autistic children fighting for school places and assessments of needs have faced the same tactics? I have a letter from Age Action which rightly calls for the release of all similar policies currently in use by the Government. In one week we have learned about a secret legal strategy regarding nursing homes and another regarding disability payments. How many more are there?

Those people, and some with disabilities, were denied their rights. That is what we are talking about. We have all heard about the Ombudsman's report and we know what its findings say. The 2010 report recommended significant repayment of moneys to those who were forced by the State to overpay. However, the State aggressively and consistently defended its stance, taking people to court.  When it became clear that the claimants were likely to succeed, the State settled before discovery. Why did it do so? It did so because discovery would have meant other individuals and families who were also denied their rights would have been made aware of the situation and were likely to take cases. I have often described the State as a juggernaut when it comes to defending its position. Not everybody who takes the State to court is right. Indeed, the State has a duty to defend the public purse. However, this case and many others I have seen show a State policy that bends before the powerful and those with wealth, influence and clout, like the banks or the church, while steamrolling the individual, the voiceless, those without connections and power and, in this case, those in nursing homes or their families and people with disabilities. I have looked at the Attorney General's report, which speaks of scarce resources and hard choices. Resources were scarce, but it is the job of Government to ensure that scarce resources are distributed fairly to all its citizens. We have heard about hard choices, but the Government took the easy choice, namely the line of least resistance to take money illegally from certain people and then defend that practice with the full weight of the State in courts. People sometimes use the term "making hard choices" as if it is somehow a noble and upright thing to do. The State made the easy choice. It was a hard choice for those who are disadvantaged. I hope the Minister of State and her colleagues will reflect on this matter carefully and try to rebalance the rights of individuals and families with managing the public purse. It cannot be easy to sit here, but the case is not yet closed. I am not asking Government to make hard choices or easy choices; rather, I am asking it to make good choices.

I will not take a breath and will stay focused. I have never read a more self-serving report that serves the narrative that has already been determined by the Government, namely that it did nothing and naughty people came forward to look for benefits that they did not deserve and were not based on legislation. Not alone is it done that way, it is also done in a way that is divisive because it asks whether younger people should now be paying for the past. It is also demeaning because it refers to people coming forward and looking for gratuitous nursing home beds.It is also very misleading and disingenuous because it does not deal with the strategy that was based on the fundamental question of whether people were entitled to nursing home care under section 52 of the existing legislation of 1970. It completely ignores the background to all of this, namely, almost 50 years of complaints encompassing three Ombudsmen from 1985. It was inundated with complaints on both sides, including the private nursing homes, where people had no choice but to go. This Attorney General tells us they had a choice. He does not even look at how they were forced into it. The Ombudsman told us the position is confused and that the key legal point is whether people have an enforceable right to be provided by the HSE. That goes on to tell us there is confusion and uncertainty, which is a hallmark not of the law but of what the Department, Ministers and governments thought the law was saying because it suited them. We get this report, which is nothing short of shocking. What it does is expose the fact the Attorney General is simply there to advise the Government and has no role in terms of the public interest. He has the cheek to equate the public interest with his analysis of a difficult financial situation and not even highlight the gap that is there, namely, the fact there is nobody there to represent the public interest. In his report, he refers to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The Minister for Health might help me there because neither I nor my office could find that Act anywhere. I will stop precisely on time even though I would like to say a lot more. I hope this is the start of a debate on the public interest role of the Attorney General or someone else.

I would say the Government is hoping it will be the end of it. According to a 2011 Department of Health report, up to 250,000 nursing home residents with medical cards were incorrectly charged for public nursing home care since 1976, yet the Attorney General’s report into the nursing home fees finds that the Government acted prudently and in the taxpayer’s interests. The report also finds that there is no positive legal duty to return proactively the disability allowance that was illegally taken from 12,000 recipients. We see yet another example of this State taking advantage of the most vulnerable in our society and then refusing to give the appropriate redress, if any, when caught out. The Attorney General’s report suggests that not only is it acceptable to take money from the most vulnerable in society but the State is then somehow not legally required to give it back when it is caught out. Unfortunately, it would not be true to say I am surprised at the Attorney General’s findings. I will say, however, that I am extremely disappointed. The report takes an incredibly narrow view and I would question the view the Attorney General has decided to take on this. We also need to question the role of the Attorney General, an unelected official with unchallenged power across all Departments and often the final say on incredibly significant issues such as this. It is concerning to me that we do not question this role more given the weight and power of his decisions, but then Ministers need something to hide behind when they make a decision, which is why we do not question it. The Attorney General's report states that the public interest, including protecting the taxpayer, was the only interest of the State and that questions of intergenerational fairness also arise in circumstances where any redress must be funded from the taxes of a younger generation of workers. This completely ignores the fact that younger generations have also suffered from this in trying to fund their parents or grandparents' care and it also calls into question the Attorney General’s idea of fairness. Is fairness taking advantage of the vulnerable in our society and then calling this a legally sound decision? It seems the Attorney General and, therefore, this Government thinks so.

Debates like these are important so that we can all reflect on how the State is currently supporting its citizens, highlight deficiencies in past approaches, particularly those affecting the vulnerable, and ensure this knowledge and learning is used to inform improvements into the future. Today the focus has been on two essential elements of our social care system, namely, services for older people and services for those with a disability. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, my priority has always been to ensure our older people get the best care possible. For many, that care can be provided in their own homes surrounded by the people and communities they love. The Government remains committed to supporting people to age in place at home in their community with access to wraparound supports, including daycare and dementia-specific daycare services, meals on wheels and home care. We are also pursuing a significant reform programme for home care which will see the introduction of a regulatory framework for the first time and will deliver equitable access to high-quality services based on a person's assessed care needs. Most older people wish to remain in their homes and communities for as long as they are able, and it is certainly Government policy to support this and something we feel strongly about. That being said, there will always be a cohort of people who require access to quality long-term residential care. Within this context, the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, established in 2009, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The scheme aims to ensure long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The scheme provides a universal and transparent system of support that is fair to all, irrespective of whether they are in public, private or voluntary nursing homes. With a total budget of €1.094 billion in 2023, the NHSS supports about 22,500 people in long-term residential care. However, this was not always the case and this has been well discussed today. We are all agreed that the previous dual system of funding for public and private nursing home care was unequal and unfair, but it was the prevailing policy at the time and it was a reflection of the financial constraints governments were operating under at the time. The issues raised over the past week are not new and have been the subject of significant debate both in the Oireachtas and in the media over many years. This includes during the 2004 to 2006 period following the Travers report and the Supreme Court judgement, during legislative debates to regularise the charging regime, and again in 2010 with the publication of the Ombudsman's report on the right to nursing home care in Ireland. It was accepted in 2004 that there was no legal basis for charging those in publicly funded care with full eligibility. This was regularised by the introduction of legislation in 2005 to provide for charges in publicly funded care and the establishment of a repayment scheme to refund charges that had been paid pre-2005. It is important to emphasise again that the scope of the scheme was well publicised and limited to those who had full eligibility under the 1970 Act and who had paid charges to the State for publicly funded care. Persons who had paid fees in private nursing homes were not eligible to apply. As we know, many people have taken legal challenges relating to claims that the State failed to provide nursing home care in private nursing homes free of charge. At all times, the consistent policy of my Department has been that any eligibility under the 1970 Act was, and continues to be, subject to the availability of resources. The reality is the State always has limited resources to fund health services along with all the other necessary services it has to provide for the benefit of its citizens. This position was set out quite clearly in a countermotion by the Government in 2010 that explicitly stated that "eligibility for in-patient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 has always been subject to, inter alia, the availability of resources". Yes, the system that was in place from the 1970s up to 2009 was unequal but that does not mean the State did not meet its legal obligations or that there was a right for people in private nursing homes to have their care funded by the State. The current Attorney General has advised that the legal advice furnished in respect of the litigation concerning charges levied for private nursing home care was sound, accurate and appropriate; that there is and was a bona fide legal defence to these cases; that the approach adopted by the Department was justified; and that the Department acted prudently in settling claims. I will now turn to matters relating to the disabled persons maintenance allowance, DPMA. Again, these issues relate to an extended time period going back almost 70 years.The historic policy with regard to eligibility for the DPMA remained largely unchanged from the 1950s to 1999. The intention of the DPMA was to provide a defined weekly rate of payment for eligible recipients living in the community. A clear and logical distinction was made between the financial needs of those living in the community in their own homes and those living in a State-provided residential care environment. As was noted by the Minister in his opening remarks, the policy at that time was such that the State would provide for people with disabilities either through in-kind support, that is, maintenance in a residential facility, or through financial support for people living in the community but not both. As we are aware, eligibility was expanded over a period, starting in the 1990s. The restrictions applying to people living in long-term care and receiving the disability allowance, formerly the disabled persons maintenance allowance, were finally abolished in January 2007 for those who would otherwise be entitled to it. Allied to this and similar to the situation in regard to nursing homes, it is a long-standing policy position that people in receipt of publicly funded residential care would make a contribution towards the cost of their care or maintenance. The residential support services maintenance and accommodation contribution, RSSMAC, provides the framework for the management of such means-tested contributions in residential facilities managed by the HSE or by section 38 organisations on behalf of the HSE. The collection of contributions under the RSSMAC framework commenced on 1 January 2017. The RSSMAC ensures service users make an affordable contribution to their maintenance and accommodation costs while retaining a sufficient level of income for personal use and to meet their personal financial commitments. In speaking about residential care for people with disabilities, it would be remiss of me not to refer to Transforming Lives, the national collaborative effort to build better services for people with disabilities. More particularly, it is important to acknowledge the 2011 report, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion, and the programme of decongregation under way. The policy objective being pursued means that, since 2011, people with disabilities have been supported to move from large institutions to their own homes in communities with the supports they need. This has resulted in the number of people living in congregated settings being halved over the past decade. It is acknowledged, however, that there will always be a cohort of people for whom care in a residential facility is optimal, and today approximately 8,200 persons with disabilities live in such facilities. The pursued model centres on supporting people to "live ordinary lives in ordinary places", in ordinary homes in the community, and almost three quarters of people living in disability residential care are now in houses located in the community. Our current policy on residential care is informed by Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Indeed, Ireland's ratification of this UN convention in March 2018 was a strong signal of our commitment to improving the lives of people with disabilities and an important milestone in a continual process to strengthen and raise awareness of their rights. The Government takes seriously the issues raised in respect of historical nursing home charges and the disabled persons maintenance allowance. The report of the Attorney General provides us with a comprehensive account of these issues. Notwithstanding the assurances provided by his report, as a further step in this process, the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Protection have undertaken to consider the report in full and revert to the Government in three months regarding any further steps that are required.

I welcome the introduction of this legislation. The Bill is the latest type of legislation that seeks to prescribe and specify powers to be exercised by members of An Garda Síochána. It is important that before we give significant powers to members of An Garda Síochána, those powers be debated by this House and specified in legislation. In the earlier parts of the 20th century, many of the significant powers members of An Garda Síochána had were ones that derived from the common law, that is, judge-made laws, but it is preferable in a modern society that members of the public are able to look at the legislation and identify where the powers An Garda Síochána is exercising come from. It is of benefit to An Garda Síochána that that is the case and, more important, it is of benefit to the public. In 2009, the Houses of the Oireachtas enacted the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which did something similar to what the legislation before us seeks to do, although it is different in many important respects. That legislation authorised and gave power to An Garda Síochána to conduct surveillance by means of covert operations. Obviously, that is an important part of any Garda function. If we want to investigate crime seriously, we need to ensure the Garda can engage in surveillance, and since 2009, there has been a specific statutory code under which An Garda Síochána can conduct surveillance. The Bill before us is, in part, different. The significant part of the legislation relates to its proposal to give powers to An Garda Síochána to use recording devices. We have discussed it in the House as being the so-called bodycam legislation but, in fact, it goes much further than body cameras that are applied to the uniforms of members of An Garda Síochána. In fact, it will authorise and permit the use of recording devices by members of An Garda Síochána that go beyond the likes of body cameras. The legislation indicates this type of recording device should, insofar as practicable, be used overtly, meaning the individuals being recorded should be aware they are being recorded. I think this will be of benefit to the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime. What is proposed under the first part of the legislation is that the Garda will be permitted to use recording devices when it believes doing so is necessary to investigate crime or to prevent crimes from occurring, and that is why I think we will see a change in the way Garda operations and investigations are conducted. We all know from our own experience that video evidence can be the best evidence available, and it will be beneficial in the investigation of criminal activity if the Garda knows confidently it can record by video either an ongoing criminal event or the scene of the crime when its members arrive on it, to be used subsequently. One issue that has arisen relates to the use of recording devices in public and private domains. We have discussed people's right to privacy but we all need to be aware and cautious that when we are in a public domain, such as a public street, we do not really enjoy the same type of privacy we have in places such as our private home or elsewhere. Sometimes we can get confused as to the extent of the right to privacy that individuals enjoy. If I am walking down a public street, people can and do video-record me. I cannot allege that my right to privacy has been breached because, as I walk down the street, a CCTV camera is interfering with my privacy. It does not interfere with my privacy given it is a public place, and I suspect that also applies to other circumstances in places that are also regarded as public. Moreover, under the legislation, the recording can take place in a private place, and it is clear from the legislation that the purpose is to ensure the occupant will be informed about this and, insofar as practicable, has provided his or her consent for that recording in a private place. Notwithstanding that, the Garda will be entitled to use these recording devices in a private place for the purposes of detecting and investigating crime, which I think will transform policing for the better. The predominant name that has been applied to this legislation is the bodycam legislation, and one of the recording devices that can be used by An Garda Síochána, and which it intends to roll out throughout the force, is a body camera. That means that when members of An Garda Síochána are carrying out their public work, everything they do in the public domain will be recorded. I think that will be of benefit to policing in this country. It is of benefit to the public that they know and can see how members of An Garda Síochána are interacting with the public and how they are dealing with members of the public who may subsequently make allegations against them.It will also benefit An Garda Síochána that it will have the opportunity and the responsibility to ensure that whatever it does in the public domain is something it would not be embarrassed to see when the body camera is inspected subsequently. We have seen how body cameras are used quite effectively around the world. Most recently, there was the tragic case in the USA of Tyre Nichols. Were it not for the body camera material available, we would not be aware of the full detail of that tragic killing. The benefits are considerable. It is important we provide the legislative basis for the use of body cameras by members of An Garda Síochána. It will then pass over to the Commissioner to try to introduce guidelines for their use. It will not be rolled out immediately overnight but I am pleased to hear there is a proposal to roll it out on a pilot basis. We should try to use it and get it up and running as quickly as possible. However there will be a consequence of which the Minister is aware and he has specified it in the legislation, namely, that the images recorded by the body cameras can subsequently be used and are admissible in court cases. That is expressly provided for in section 44. I would think this will transform civil and criminal litigation. In many situations, particularly when it comes to criminal prosecutions, the person accused of an offence will want to gain access to and have disclosure of the body camera material, and there is no basis on which they could be refused it. Similarly important, I expect that in civil litigation, a lot of additional burden will be put on An Garda Síochána to make data and body camera image available for the purpose of litigation that may involve An Garda Síochána or may, indeed, involve third parties but where the information from the Garda will be relevant. It will put significant work on An Garda Síochána to try to decipher and set out a plan for how it will make sure that information can be accessed. It is obviously data but I do not know the extent to which it is regarded as personal data. I suspect, like CCTV footage, one cannot just apply for it because one claims it is personal data. However, it will be important information that can be availed of by litigants in either civil or criminal litigation. I believe it will be beneficial to the investigation of crime, to policing in the country and that it will serve the public and the Garda as well. Another part of the legislation that has not received a lot of scrutiny in the House is the automatic numberplate recognition. That enables gardaí to monitor the use of a particular vehicle. There is a basis for it through authorisation which is provided. It is beneficial that we see these considerable powers the Garda has are grounded in legislation we have been able to debate in the House and vote upon. Section 21 provides for the power of An Garda Síochána to record certain phone calls. The statutory prohibition is a prohibition on the Garda recording phone calls except in certain circumstances where it relates to designated lines or is authorised by law. The presumption is that your phone call to the Garda will not be recorded, but I suspect in the majority of cases they will be because they will be designated lines. Obviously, emergency calls should be recorded. It is important for the purpose of reviewing An Garda Síochána and protecting important information that they are recorded, but it is important we provide a statutory basis for it. The next part of the Bill deals with CCTV. It is of great benefit. Communities feel very comfortable when they have CCTV in their communities. There is a mechanism under the Bill for the Garda Commissioner to permit it. There is also a mechanism for local authorities to contact the Garda Commissioner to get permission. There has been a lot of talk about facial recognition technology. It is not in the Bill at present. I will not comment on it because I have not yet had opportunity to look at it but I hope to have an opportunity to read it in due course and to comment on it then. We cannot avoid the consequences of technology, which keeps advancing in the world. We are better off trying to stay up with it rather than pretending it does not exist.

The use of body cameras will be a very important improvement for An Garda Síochána in terms of its members' safety and the safety of the community. These represent a technological advance that we should welcome. I spend a lot of time talking about parking in bus lanes. Automatic number plate recognition is essential to combating that. This is an issue I have brought to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and the Minister always tells me it is an issue for the Minister for Justice. Therefore I am delighted to see some use of automatic number plate recognition. Any time we give new powers to the Garda, we must be sensitive, have a debate and ensure there are checks and balances so that the powers we give strike the right balance between the right of the community at large to be safe and the rights of the individual citizen. In that regard, I will raise some things in the Bill but I will start by raising something that is not in the Bill. I will start where Deputy O’Callaghan ended, namely with facial recognition technology aspects which were spoken about. I am gravely concerned because facial recognition technology does not work. It is filled with race, age and gender biases. If we are introducing facial recognition technology with the hope of streamlining Garda work and making it easier for gardaí to catch and prosecute criminals, then swamping them with a load of false negatives of innocent people who have been caught up in the dragnet of facial recognition technology or mass surveillance will just overwhelm our already overburdened courts and our already overburdened gardaí. Facial recognition technology does not work and in its current form is likely to make things worse. Even if it does work, and it does not, there are challenges because it opens a door to mass surveillance. The question must be asked whether the introduction of facial recognition technology would be in line with the fundamental freedoms of the EU citizen that the European Union promises.

Where was I? Even if facial recognition technology does work, and it does not, it opens the door to mass surveillance and threatens the rights of citizens in the EU. That brings me back to the point about balance. Facial recognition technology is something that needs full pre-legislative scrutiny. It is not something that can be added as an amendment on Committee Stage. The pre-legislative report of the Joint Committee on Justice said that body-worn cameras and recording devices should not have facial recognition technology. Given that the committee has already looked at this and said it does not think facial recognition technology is appropriate, to try to introduce it in a Committee Stage amendment would sidestep the debate that is much needed whenever we give the Garda more powers. I also question why the rush. The EU is working on an artificial intelligence, AI, act which would regulate things such as facial recognition technology, AI and algorithmic software. Quite often, Deputies raise issues in the House around regulation we desire or that we feel is needed and we are told the EU is working on it and why would we pre-empt the EU. Therefore, when the EU is so often given as a reason not to rush, if the EU is working on this, why then are we pre-empting the EU in this case? It strikes me that rushing on facial recognition technology is premature given the state of the technology, the lack of consideration given to it in the House and the developments that are taking place at EU level. I will now turn to what is in the Bill.Section 9(1)(a) provides for the use of recording devices in public or in a place where a garda is entitled to be by law or in the operation of their duty. It is described quite clearly. Section 9(1)(b) provides for the use of recording devices on animals in a public place or a place where a garda is entitled to be. Section 9(1)(c) provides for the use of drones but does not include those qualifiers concerning a public place or a place where a guard is entitled to be. I raised this point during pre-legislative scrutiny. A drone for crowd control at a public demonstration on O’Connell State is one thing, but a drone operating above a suburban estate is a very different thing and will record things that are not in a public place or a place where a garda is entitled to be. That raises questions about search without warrant and these kind of things. For section 9(1)(c) to not have those qualifiers is a problem. Obviously, this will end up in the courts and jurisprudence will come out of that but we should put those things in the legislation. Section 43 refers to the codes of practice. Section 43(3)(b) lists those bodies that should be consulted on the development of the codes of practice. There is no public consultation in that and I fully believe public consultation should be part of the development of a code of practice and should be baked into the legislation. That is for a variety of reasons. First, it will provide a chance for citizens to comment on the rules by which they are policed, which is inherent in the policing by consent that An Garda Síochána undertakes. Second, it is a way of educating the public about their rights and the powers of the Garda so that an informed citizenry knows what is happening. The committee said in its pre-legislative scrutiny report that the justice committee should be included and that the draft code of practices should be put before the committee for debate or consideration, or the option of consideration at least. Another angle I ask the Minister to look at before Committee Stage is the frequency, every five years, with which these are to be reviewed. The pre-legislative report of the committee said it should be every two years. Five years is too long for review, given the intrusive nature of cameras and recording devices. There are times when we need members of the Garda to be intrusive in the interests of public safety but it is important that we consider those guidelines and codes of practice more frequently than every five years.  Section 39 concerns the approval of processing of live feed of third-party CCTV without a judicial warrant. This would allow for an officer of sufficient rank who is independent of the investigation to provide approval for this. Again, the committee's pre-legislative report raised concern over this. I would raise concern in general in relation to members of the Garda approving their own warrants. The logic of the court case this came from, Damache v. Minister for Justice, was that to provide checks, balances and oversight, a warrant should be considered by someone entirely independent. Given the PwC culture audit, in which people are still talking about the importance of silence in An Garda Síochána or members' fear of speaking out, how independent can such a warrant truly be? We are better off having it fully independent in the hands of the Judiciary. That may beg questions as to whether the District Court has capacity, but the issue there is of judicial capacity, which I have spoken about many times on my hind legs in here, and with the Minister. The fix is judicial capacity and the capacity of the District Court, instead of a shortcut through the rights of the citizen.

I would say the Minister is just glad I did not ask him the question I always ask him at this point. That is for another day. We all accept the necessity of the likes of this "bodycam" technology. I think there is general agreement on the necessity of ensuring, as with any solution, that resourcing is available. Part of that is training. Training will need to be updated. We will need to involve the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, the Garda Commissioner, the Data Protection Commissioner and all other stakeholders. It would be the first time ever if we were to put a training regime in place that did not need to be put on a feedback loop, checked and fixed. Protection of data is a vital part of this but I agree with what Deputy Jim O’Callaghan said on there being no absolutes or absolute freedoms. This resource needs to be provided to members of the Garda for their protection and it will be useful for witnesses and many others. We have seen many examples in countries across the European Union, as well as Britain and the US. Mention was made of the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols. A significant amount of what will end up as evidence in court will be from dashcam and "bodycam" technology. That provides an argument for what we are discussing. We could easily make the argument that we should have been in here earlier dealing with this. Deputy Costello is correct that we need to make sure due diligence is done, particularly when we get into ancillary issues relating to this.  A fair argument has been put out there about this being a deterrent in relation to assault and intimidation of members of the Garda. Many of us are aware of examples of this and have seen many cases of gardaí being attacked in the last while. Even anybody who switched on a TV screen recently will be aware. If people saw the pieces I did on "The Guards: Inside the K", they will remember gardaí being intimidated and threatened with sexual assault as they did their work and dealt with issues. Sometimes we need to provide evidence that can be used straight away in court because not everyone will have a film crew chasing them. It shows the madness of the world we are in that the threats were made while this was being filmed. Any protection that can be given to members of the Garda is a necessity. I said it earlier but in the early stages of witness outcry, such as a garda coming upon a witness to a sexual assault or a serious physical assault, that garda is dealing with evidence that could be provided in court. A witness may have to go through some traumatisation but we may be able to save him or her from part of it. That is vital. We all know the wider issue in relation to CCTV. We need to facilitate it. We know the issues there have been for councils, members of the Garda and everybody else in relation to the general data protection regulation, GDPR. It can be a deterrent against crime but anyone with a mask and hood can generally get around it. Where these deterrents are usable and make sense, we should use them. We know the wider issues we have had with resourcing. Everybody has had stories in the recent past about ringing Garda stations and being told there are not sufficient cars available. The issues relating to Garda numbers need to be addressed.Then, there is that protection for members of the Garda if people make complaints. We all accept the absolute need for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. We need to see accountability in the Garda. Like many others, however, gardaí have had to deal with spurious GSOC complaints. This can provide some level of protection in that regard. I recall dealing with the former chief superintendent for County Louth, Mr. Christy Mangan. He spoke about two young female gardaí basically being wigged, for want of a better term, when dealing with somebody with huge mental health issues who was going through some form of breakdown. They contained and controlled the scenario but the only thing they were dealing with was people putting phones in the air and all the rest of it. As we are already in a surveillance society, we have to ensure that we can give that bit of added protection to Garda members. We would like to see better manners and less of the madness with regard to people taking photographs and videos and putting content online that it is absolutely sickening. We have all seen that, particularly in the last while. Deputy Costello spoke about judicial capacity and that is something at which we need to look. I spoke to a garda recently about the recent attacks that have happened to gardaí and their property. It was from a point of view of not being particularly happy with the outcome. We know there is separation with regard to the actions of the Judiciary. However, it fed into that idea that sometimes, Garda members feel like we do not necessarily have their backs at this point. That needs to be dealt with. That is with regard to resourcing but also the wider issue that cases take far too long to get through the courts. In certain specific instances, what we need and want to see are obviously those early interventions. Initiatives such as the Greentown project and anything else that can be done from a diversionary point of view, and even earlier interventions at a community and family level, can help those people who maybe have a greater likelihood of falling into criminality, which, unfortunately for them, is sometimes a bit more pervasive than we would like within the wider community. There are definite pieces of work we must do in that regard. We have to deal with very dangerous criminals at this point in time. We probably are all sick of talking about organised crime and drug criminality over the years and dealing with drug debt intimidation at a significant level. We hope the citizens' assembly can look at something that is far more progressive. We will look at best practice across the world. However, we will still need to resource the Garda from a point of view of dealing with dangerous criminals who are impacting severely on our communities. As regards looking at facial recognition and all the rest, we have to do a specific piece of work regarding due diligence. There have been issues around artificial intelligence, AI, in that not enough work has been done on particular data sets for which the algorithms have been lacking. Technology always improves but there is a wider issue. We need to ensure that we have all the necessary protections put in place. This is a decent first step. We need to make sure we are covering all our bases and that if we are providing this sort of technology for the Garda, we provide the training and resourcing. However, we will have a wider issue regarding giving the support to the Garda it requires. We have wider issues in respect of dealing with the huge issues around crime. I am talking specifically about organised crime and drug-related crime, which are having such an impact. It is all-pervasive throughout every community across the board. We know that people in working-class areas are at times dealing with these gangs on a day-to-day basis, however, and we really have not given them the support and protections that are required.

For far too long, An Garda Síochána has been hampered in its ability to tackle crime. Obviously, and I will come back to this, there is a need for every additional power the Minister gives to An Garda Síochána to be linked to oversight and an understanding of why it is being done and whether it is justifiable. If the Minister reads the submission by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, it quite rightly states that in other jurisdictions, some of what is being proposed here has not worked and that some what has been proposed, in fact, ends up doing the exact opposite and drives some of those who are involved in crime to be more secretive and not be in public. This means An Garda Síochána would then have to become more skilled in covert actions and longer-term surveillance. There are, therefore, concerns. There is a concern, obviously, about mass surveillance, which other Deputies have talked about. One issue that struck me is something I have raised with different people and which I thought might filter into this legislation but does not, is that Garda cars have no dashcams. It struck home for me when two female gardaí in Cherry Orchard were rammed. The only reason we all knew what happened is that the idiots who did it were filming themselves or their friends were filming. That is a situation where, rightly, a Garda car should have a camera front and back. The Luas has a camera front and back, which the Garda can access if there is a crime in the vicinity. Buses have it, as does virtually every single new car a person buys. We hear an appeal every single day asking whether anybody has dashcam footage. There is no point in appealing to An Garda Síochána; it does not have it because the cars are not fitted with it. That is illogical. If it is not already allowed, then it should be. It should be included in this legislation in order that we can discuss it at the same time. Perhaps it was that the cars were parked in that bundle of cars that came in during Covid-19 that did not have that technology. As far as I know, however, it is not routinely installed. That brings me to the second point. I spoke to a local superintendent the other day and his concern was not about the recordings. He said it was about the volume of material that will be recorded. Where will it be stored? Who can access it? For how long will it be recorded? Then, there is that extra duty it places on top of existing members of the Garda who are trying to carry out their jobs. Obviously, this means there may be a bigger civilian cohort attached to An Garda Síochána. It needs to be addressed, however. That means an extra cost in terms of the Garda Vote. With regard to CCTV footage, people in my constituency have for years called out for more Garda cameras. There are local authority cameras in virtually every single Dublin City Council housing complex. There are cameras in certain areas of Cherry Orchard. Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard have 12 or maybe 13 very high tower cameras, some of which were purposely knocked down by trucks. They were obviously having an effect, or were likely to have an effect, if the criminal gangs went after them. I do not have a concern about CCTV footage per se. It is a mass surveillance device but we might consider that nearly every single household that buys a doorbell now buys a Wi-Fi bell that records footage. We do not know who controls those images. It is right that An Garda Síochána and local authorities work better together, which they have done quite well in my area. It is about the storage of this data, however. For how long will this be stored so that it is not never-ending? Who will oversee it and ensure there are no data breaches? It is a huge outlay. I am totally opposed to facial recognition technology because it has not been discussed by Members. Amending legislation would probably be better in this regard than would a committee amendment. The balance obviously has to be correct. One other piece within this briefing we received from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service mentioned that there should be CCTV footage within Garda stations. That is logical. At the end of the day, it is not just to protect members of An Garda Síochána; it is also meant to protect the public in this day and age.Again, this is to do with people knowing there is a camera, whether it is a big sign or in blue lights or whatever. This applies also to the body cameras. It is a different regime when one starts talking about covert and overt. That needs to be teased out in a lot more detail on Committee Stage.

We have seen wide levels of engagement on this matter from stakeholders on the front line from rank and file gardaí, right up to the Garda Commissioner. I understand that all of them have welcomed the support for the use of body cameras. Deputy Costello referred to public consultation. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Harris, will clarify whether that will be an integral part of this legislation. It is very important that people are aware of what the legislation is, how it will work, and have an understanding of it. It is important to bring people along with us and not just announce the legislation. I certainly will be interested to hear about that. It is really important that there is a public consultation element to it. For years the modernising of An Garda Síochána has moved at far too slow a pace. Ireland has lagged behind other EU member states for many years on this front. Those who stand on the front line serving the public in times of need must be given the tools and resources to ensure a high standard of public safety. It is important that these are provided in order that both members of the Garda and the public are protected, so it is a win-win. I will take this chance to acknowledge the really good work that members of the Garda do in Pearse Street and Kevin Street Garda stations. Gardaí working on the front line do a really good and professional job. The job they do is very important. The violent running battles in the City Quay area are well documented. The gardaí from Pearse Street Garda station have done a fantastic job in working with City Quay residents and Creighton Street residents. Their work is far from easy but they do it so professionally and their commitment is second to none. Superintendent Dermot McKenna of Pearse Street Garda station has been involved from the start in ensuring resources are in place to protect residents. I believe the Garda needs more resources in the inner city. I have said it before and I will continue to say it. This is essential. The Government needs to respond. The Cabbage Patch in Kevin Street is a small park in Dublin 8 that has been neglected for years. It would not be safe unless members of the Garda were involved in saving this park. A lot more work needs to be done but it is heading in the right direction. I welcome this legislation. The body camera is key. As mentioned previously, we are in a surveillance society. It appears to be in everything, from doorbells, to the Luas, to people using phones. I saw an incident recently where someone was being assaulted. Rather than call the Garda, people filmed it. It seems that this is the type of society we have gone to. The use of body cameras is not a ground-breaking or radical idea. It has been on the go for many years across the US, England, Scotland and Wales, along with many EU member states. The benefits are well documented. Body cameras have been shown to work in a twofold manner: footage can provide for protection for members of An Garda Síochána from bogus complaints, and they can also provide the public with a safeguard against Garda wrongdoing. We are witnessing record numbers of members of An Garda Síochána leaving the job in the past few years. From what I can ascertain from meeting gardaí on the front line, morale appears low and people are very downbeat about working in An Garda Síochána in the future. On many occasions they are despondent and this is reflected in the numbers of people leaving. It is vital that we provide new and existing members of An Garda Síochána with the best tools and resources to go about their duties. I suppose, however, it is wider than just that, as the Minister will be aware. We need to ensure the protection of people and provide the technology to Garda members to do their job properly. While body cameras are a step in the right direction, they must go hand in hand with increasing the resources across the board and by increasing the numbers of gardaí available to communities right across the State.

I will get to that later. As I understand it, this is the first of three Bills due to be introduced this year that will address reform in An Garda Síochána. There are many issues within An Garda Síochána and there is no doubt that reform is badly needed in the organisation. I find it amazing, however, that instead of addressing the many areas of Garda reform required, the first thing this Government has decided to prioritise is the introduction of new equipment, such as body-worn cameras - for which we are not absolutely 100% sure of the need - at a financial cost to the State and with a cost to our citizens’ rights to privacy and data protection. I will start by referencing the Data Protection Commission, which has outlined that An Garda Síochána has an extremely poor record of how it uses its own technology, particularly the use of CCTV. A report by the commission published in 2019 regarding CCTV schemes authorised under An Garda Síochána states:The members of AGS operating a number of the schemes inspected had received no training on the operation of the CCTV systems and the correct handling and protection of the personal data involved. In one instance, ... the Garda members operating the scheme were unaware of the full range of technical features of their own CCTV system.The commission report recommended that "The lack of overall training in relation to the operation of the CCTV systems and the correct handling and protection of the personal data involved must be addressed by means of a comprehensive training programme with significant data protection elements." This was further backed up by a Garda internal audit issued last year, which stated that a lack of knowledge by An Garda Síochána staff of their data protection responsibilities due to inadequate training by the Garda national data protection unit leads to breaches and non-adherence to the statutory obligations within An Garda Síochána. Sadly, we all know examples of this, and I am thinking particularly of the garda who recorded video footage of a Dublin woman being detained under the Mental Health Act while she was walking naked on a Dublin street. I am extremely concerned then of the idea of massively increasing the amount of filming by members of the Garda of the public on a daily basis. This is particularly concerning due to the fact that there is absolutely no evidence as to why these powers are necessary. There is a complete lack of evidence from other jurisdictions to show that body cameras contribute positively to policing. In fact, we have seen multiple examples in other jurisdictions where such cameras have actually been used inappropriately. The reality is that An Garda Síochána has not shown any ability to deal appropriately with the information it already has. Research results on the effectiveness of increased surveillance are mixed and inconclusive. One Irish study showed that the installation of CCTV led to a decrease in crime in one area and an increase in another. Many surveillance technologies are relatively new and under-researched. This is why the assessment of any future devices on a case-by-case basis should be included in this legislation. This is particularly important due to the fact that the definition of a recording device is so broad. It includes camcorders, mobile phones, drones, and possible emerging technologies in the future. The Bill is missing many important provisions, including the provision to ensure that a garda operating a recording device is identifiable as a garda, and the provision to ensure that all members of the Garda using the device have sufficient data protection training or are suitably qualified. These are very important provisions that should be included in legislation such as this, which provides for the greater and more invasive monitoring of citizens. One aspect of the Bill that I welcome is the introduction of an assessment, carried out by the Garda Commissioner, of the impact of the proposed code on the human rights of individuals who would be affected by it. I wonder whether the Garda Commissioner is the right person to actually carry out that assessment. Perhaps the Policing Authority or some other entity would be in a better position to do that. My biggest concern, however, is the fact that the then Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, had indicated her intention to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to the Bill to provide for facial recognition technology. It is completely unacceptable to bring forward this legislation today, half written by the Government, with the intention of throwing in such important amendments on Committee Stage. There is absolutely no excuse for this complete disregard for the legislative process. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, clearly stated on 25 May 2022 that it was her intention to provide for the use of facial recognition technology. The Bill was published three months later, on 4 August. The Minister had three months to write facial recognition technology into this legislation but she did not. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, decided instead to publish the Bill without it and then add this extremely important and controversial provision on Committee Stage. Why is this? I can think of no other excuse for this other than the fact that the Government does not want this raised during Second Stage debates in the Chamber. If this is the case, then this is an incredibly sinister and disturbing move. This needs to be addressed urgently because it is starting to become a trend. The Minister clearly identified in May last year that she wanted to include that provision. The legislation was published in August 2022 but here we are now in February of the following year, and yet the Minister could not actually put this forward at any stage before this point. I do not think this is believable at all.We are seeing a trend of the Government undermining the legislative process. I have been raising this continuously over the past couple of years and it seems that this is yet another tactic it is using. I know the Government is dead set on introducing this legislation, no matter what the Opposition says, but I urge the Minister to commit to a pilot project and see how things play out in the field before rolling this out nationally. Such a pilot should include robust mechanisms of operational and scientific review, with clear criteria set out that must be met before wider roll-out of this technology is initiated. This is the very least that can be done when introducing invasive and unnecessary cameras nationally. Deputy Ó Snodaigh was talking earlier about the Garda, the complexity and the availability of technology, and such matters. I was just reminded when he was saying that where I was stopped by the members of the PSNI in the North one night on my way home and they were able to pull up in their car device straight away all of the data on my car which is from the South. They said that I had not got a valid tax disc on the computer system which they had. I showed them the valid tax disc on the windscreen and they said that this anomaly was probably because An Garda Síochána does not update the database it has. Funnily enough, I happened to continue on home and I was stopped by the Garda outside of my own town of Killybegs. I asked could they look up the same system in respect of my car in that way. They said that they could but said that the car that could do this was only around one day a week, that they could request to have the car there that had that data and system which could have provide the information required. There were two squad cars at the roadblock I was stopped at. The gardaí could not access their own information which the PSNI can access from the Garda, even though the Garda does not update the information that the PSNI can access. Members of the Garda themselves, however, cannot access this information. This is a crazy system. We are talking about this and then we talk about introducing more legislation.Even if the body cameras come in, will it be one garda out of every 1,000 who will have one? If he or she is lucky enough at the incident at which it is required, will he or she will actually get a film of it? That is the way it is shaping up. If a Garda car involved in traffic control duties in the South cannot have the same computerised system on board that identifies the car, and any problems with it, and if the PSNI can have that in the North; then there is something badly wrong.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	307	First, I very much welcome that throughout this Second Stage debate, we have had Members from all sides of this House condemn the recent spate of attacks, assaults, or attempts to intimidate members of An Garda Síochána. It is very important this House sends out that message. The second point I wish to make while introducing this legislation is that it is important, as Minister for Justice, that one listens to everybody. I try to listen to everyone and to different views but it is particularly important that the Minister for Justice listens to and acts upon the feedback of the men and women of An Garda Síochána on the front line. They have asked us to pass this legislation and to provide them with body cameras. I find it extraordinarily ironic that Garda members are often called - we cannot imagine this because we only debate these things in these Chambers - at all sorts of hours in the day and night to a whole variety of events, be they protests or other things, where the only person not with the camera in his or her hand is the garda. That is ironic, inappropriate, outdated and neither I nor this Government nor, I hope, these Houses of the Oireachtas, will stand over a scenario where we do not provide Garda members with basic modern technology to do their jobs and to keep themselves safe so that when they go out the door in the morning, whosoever they leave behind in the house knows that the Government and the Garda have provided them with the tools to keep them safe and to keep people safe. That is fundamentally what we are trying to do here. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan put it very well - I wrote it down - when he said that we cannot ignore the consequences of technology and it is better to keep up with it. That is entirely right. The idea that we would continue to ask An Garda Síochána to police in the 21st century but fail to provide them with access to the resources, tools and technology of the 21st century seems to me to be inefficient, ineffective and somewhat foolhardy.  There have been changes and there are many legitimate questions which have been raised by people and some of these questions are ones which perhaps may been raised when the likes of DNA was introduced. These are big changes, they raise questions, but they are not changes that An Garda Síochána cannot respond to and that we cannot legislate for with appropriate oversight structures to be put in place.  It is of vital importance that members of the Garda have the tools they need to combat crime and to protect the public and it is equally important that there are tools and sufficient safeguards around the use of such devices. I would like to address a number of the points raised by Deputies in the course of this Second Stage debate. First, turning to an issue that a number of Deputies touched upon quite rightly, namely, the issue of security in data storage and access. I wholeheartedly agree with Deputies who alluded to the utmost importance that all data gathered be stored securely and that access to it be carefully regulated. Any improper access or dissemination would be subject to existing offences which, of course, also means that it is subject to the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in deciding to prosecute. Garda members and members of the civilian staff will be subject to serious disciplinary repercussions should it be found that they have improperly accessed or disseminated any data gathered. A number of Deputies also pointed out the importance of safeguards and oversight. Garda use of either automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, or of CCTV is subject to a robust internal approval procedure that ensures any casual or inappropriate use of these tools will not be possible. More than this, if their use is beyond a defined time period, judicial authorisation will be required. This approval procedure is a key safeguard in this legislation. Another key point is that there is independent oversight, through section 45, which provides for judicial overview and regular reporting to the Taoiseach on ANPR and the processing of third-party CCTV. Perhaps the most important agent for safeguarding oversight in this legislation is the codes of practice, which will outline requirements on storage, access, retention, deletion, and data subject rights. As Deputies will appreciate, detailed procedures for the day-to-day operation of recording devices simply cannot be included in primary legislation. These codes represent an important counterbalance to An Garda Síochána's use of these tools. In drafting these codes the Garda Commissioner will be required by section 43(3) to consult crucially important bodies but the consultation will not stop there. Any interested organisations, NGOs, or private individuals can make representations for consideration by the Commissioner. I have heard call in respect of the role of public consultation, the role of the Oireachtas, and I believe that we can, will and should tease that through on Committee Stage. The Garda Commissioner will be further required to carry out impact assessments, on human rights and on data protection as part of the process. Turning to a number of issues raised in the context of body-worn cameras, Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about the ability of individual gardaí to turn on and off their body-worn cameras. Gardaí will have this ability as it is appropriate that Garda members should only turn on a body-worn camera where they are dealing with a specific incident, and in accordance with any provisions as will be set out in the relevant code of practice. If a member of Garda personnel turns off their body-worn camera in an instance where they should not, then they will have to justify their decision to turn that camera off. There is a danger that if a camera is always turned on, that there would be serious privacy implications for people who happen to be near a member of Garda personnel with a camera. The code of practice will set out when it would be inappropriate to record in line with international best practice. Deputy Daly raised a point on the need for a pilot scheme to trial body-worn cameras. I take the Deputy's point on this issue and I understand that it is the intention of An Garda Síochána to do such a pilot. We need to legislate for it but the Commissioners has made it very clear that once we legislate for the use, it is his intention to put a pilot in place before the broader roll-out. On a final point on body-worn cameras and to address an issue raised by Deputy Connolly, who stated that she was cynical as to the potential assistance that body-worn cameras could provide when a garda attends a domestic incident, I would point the Deputy to the submission by Women's Aid to the Commission of the Future of Policing in Ireland. I would also say that in my experience in speaking to front-line gardaí, this is a tool that is seen as a huge addition in the very particular circumstances surrounding domestic violence, where the moments in which one first arrives at the scene can be crucial in gathering evidence that can be very important later on. Moving to address issues raised with regard to facial recognition technology, as I said in my opening speech, I believe very strongly that any inclusion of such amendments would be an important aid to victims in furthering investigations as quickly as possible. However, I should reiterate that this is a matter on which the Government has not yet finalised its position. As I said in my opening speech, there are many legitimate concerns as to the use of this technology and these concerns require careful consideration. I am continuing to engage with colleagues and I hope to be in a position to provide an update to Government, and subsequently to this House, once this work has been completed. It is important that in finalising our approach, we listen to the views of the Garda Commissioner as well on this important matter. I will to deal with a number of specific issues which were raised, including the effectiveness of this technology and the manner in which it has been omitted from the Bill here on Second Stage. Some Deputies expressed concern in regard to effectiveness. The National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States is seen as the gold standard in testing the accuracy of facial recognition algorithms. In a recent report, which included a study of 127 different algorithms, the most accurate ones were found to fail only in about one quarter of 1% of searches. Bearing in mind that the same study utilised 26 million images of 12 million individuals; it must be recognised that the accuracy of the most advanced technology is impressive.The results point towards the best machine performing in the same range as the very best professional facial examiners. This is the calibre of algorithm that An Garda Síochána would utilise. Notwithstanding the accuracy of this algorithm, there is the added safeguard that this technology would only be used in conjunction with the oversight of at least two highly trained individuals who would be identifiable throughout the process and would remain accountable for any decisions taken. This combination of FRT allied with all decisions being made by people, not machines, who will be held to account for these decisions represents international best practice and the way in which I intend to proceed. I will point to the retrospective use of FRT as a particularly strong example of where this technology can make a crucial contribution. Such retrospective use has led to many success stories in respect of child sex abuse and human trafficking. By reason of the sheer volume of the images in such an investigation, FRT can be essential when trying to examine what can be upwards of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of records. This can speed up an investigation and save Garda time in having to manually trawl through databases of the most harrowing images. With regard to FRT's omission from the Bill, which is an issue that came up on many occasions, and its earlier omission from the general scheme, the answer is quite simple. The Bill was initially designed to focus on recording and accessing images. A much clearer provision was needed on processing and facial recognition was thus explored, including the extent to which it could be used. Extensive legal advice was received from the Attorney General's office and was carefully considered. It was concluded that further research would be required to understand the precise-use cases where there could be a need for this and to examine best international practice. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will agree that it is entirely within my right, or that of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, or any Member of this House, to bring forward an amendment to legislation on Committee Stage. It is far from some charged language about an abuse of the legislative process. Last time I checked, that is the legislative process. It is open to any Member of this House to seek to amend legislation on any Stage. Just because somebody becomes a Minister, he or she does not forgo that right. On EU legislation and the likes, any inclusion of FRT as an addition to this Bill on Committee Stage would not represent this State becoming an outlier to the direction of travel on this issue in Europe. In fact, the current position is one in which we are an outlier. There are, however, serious and deeply held views regarding this legislation, which should be carefully considered. The Government will engage and reach a position on this. I will then update the House and share such information with the House in advance of Committee Stage. The Bill is an important step forward in providing gardaí with basic, modern equipment to keep them and the public safe. I commend Second Stage of this Bill to the House.

I thank the Minister of State for taking the motion, which notes that not enough homes are being built; that there are too many unused, vacant and derelict homes; and that over-reliance on the private sector to address the housing crisis has only worsened that crisis. Our motion also notes that Housing for All has failed as its targets are too low or non-existent and the Government is not meeting its targets specifically on social and affordable housing. Our motion further sets the context by recognising that a generation of young people are locked out of home ownership or secure and affordable tenancies. We have seen figures indicating that 92% of those aged 18 to 24 are concerned they will never be able to afford a home and half are considering emigration. It is in that context that we move our motion calling on the Government to introduce a series of emergency housing measures to address this crisis. We are moving this motion during a month when we are marking three years since the number of people in State emergency accommodation first reached what was seen as the critical figure of 10,000. Three years ago this month was the first time since the foundation of the State that figure was reached. That is a rather depressing anniversary, but we debate the motion against an even starker backdrop of figures. There was another record in December of 11,632 people recorded as homeless, which is well above the 10,000 mark that was in itself seen as appalling three years ago. Of those 11,632 people, 3,442 are children. That is in 2023 in what is a prosperous country, with effectively full employment, that has run budget surpluses, as we know. Of course, we also know that this figure, staggering as it is, does not capture those who are sleeping rough, those forced to couch surf, and all those in housing insecurity. I will speak shortly about the many individuals who contacted me through my constituency office who are in that sort of housing insecurity, without any assurance or expectation that they will be able to stay in their homes into the future. That is a very serious and dire situation for people to be in, especially those with children. Hidden among the figures are the 40% of employees under the age of 35 who are not listed as homeless anywhere and are not couch surfing but continue to live with their parents in a state of suspended childhood and dependency. This is a generation locked out of home ownership and secure and affordable tenancies. All of us have met those young, and some not-so-young, people and their parents. All of us are conscious that for them, their parents, and even parents who themselves are in secure homes, that this is an untenable situation. This is the big social issue of our times. It has huge knock-on consequences because our social protection and pension system for those in older age has always been predicated on a presumption that by retirement and pensionable age people will have reached a mortgage-free home ownership situation. Our entire social protection system is based on that premise, yet that is no longer the case for far too many people. A constituent of mine recently calculated that after 26 years of renting in Dublin, with no prospect of home ownership, they have paid more than €341,000 in rent, which is a staggering figure. That is money which is not going towards saving for retirement or paying for a home of their own. I am also hearing from pensioners in my constituency who are still renting well beyond the point where they thought they would be able to afford to buy, who are now unable to make their rent payments and are in that sort of housing insecurity I described. People in their 70s who have paid taxes and contributed for decades are contacting my office because they are facing eviction and cannot find anywhere else to live. This is unconscionable.  I will speak about children in particular. As I said, we have seen that 3,442 of those currently accessing emergency accommodation are children. No child should be in that situation of housing insecurity. No child should be faced with having to sleep rough or sleep on the streets. No child should be sent to a Garda station in the middle of the night for want of a place to go. No child should spend months on end with only a hotel room, shared with the rest of his or her family, to call home. Yet, I am hearing, as we all are, about children who are in those circumstances. I hear from so many people who are working with children in that situation, not just parents but teachers and those who are trying to pick up the pieces for those children. We passed a referendum to enshrine children's rights into the Constitution five years ago but it has to mean something to those most vulnerable children. In 2017, the Oireachtas voted in support of the Labour Party’s Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, which would create a statutory obligation to keep families out of homelessness. It progressed to the next Stage with support from Fianna Fáil but has been left to languish since then. We included some of that Bill's provisions within some of the constructive proposals we included in the motion. I will speak about the rental crisis and market failure. In anticipation of this debate, I looked at properties in my constituency, Dublin Bay South, on daft.ie. The most affordable two-person home I could find in that area costs €1,300 per month. That is the most affordable. It is a one-bedroom studio - just about a two-person home - with no oven and no sofa, just a bed. One notice for a single-bedroom flat for rent went up on daft.ie this morning; it has already had more than 9,000 views. I am hearing, as we all are, from people who have looked at hundreds of homes and sought to rent hundreds of places and cannot do so. I spoke previously about a constituent who was invited to bid for rent. The landlord did not set the rent but invited offers like an auction.That was in a rent pressure zone. The market has failed. It cannot provide this fundamental human right, so we see people left queuing for hours for house viewings, living from paycheck to paycheck and unable to save for the future. I represent a constituency where 44% of properties are rented on the private market and so many people face insecurity and being given eviction notices. The primary cause of families entering homelessness is the landlord declaring an intent to sell the property, Focus Ireland tells us. During the pandemic we saw the impact an eviction ban can have in preventing people from entering homelessness. Because of that, we have called for a temporary extension of the ban through to the end of the year, not just for its own sake but also to give breathing space to the Government to bring forward policies and measures that will provide greater security to those who may well face eviction at the end of the ban. Avoiding a deluge of evictions means bringing in emergency measures of the sort we call for in our motion. I have heard from many landlords in my constituency too. Many of them are what we might describe as accidental landlords who own just one property that they bought to equate to a pension for themselves. They feel under threat and unfairly scapegoated, but this is not in any way about castigating or criticising individual landlords. It is about years and years of Government policy that has led us to an overreliance by the State on private landlords, many of whom are small landlords, in order to fill a gap in State provision of social and affordable housing. This is therefore not in any way about critiquing individual landlords; it is about critiquing State policy that has created that overreliance on the market. What are the constructive measures we propose? We want to see the tenant in situ scheme ramped up. We want to see monthly reporting from each local authority on that scheme. We want to see the Residential Tenancies Board mandated to inform local authorities when a notice for eviction has been served in order that it can act to secure the home and to stop the tenant from entering homelessness. The idea of an extension of the eviction ban is to give the Government time to plan and to put in place measures to ensure that the tenant in situ scheme will work better. It is not just renters I hear from about this scheme. Last night I received an email from a small landlord in an urban area who wants to sell up and leave the rental market. The landlord has two tenants on the housing assistance payment. The person wants those tenants to remain in that home and has sought that the local authority would buy the home in order to keep the tenants in that home. This landlord is utterly frustrated because the local authority simply refuses to buy under the scheme. The landlord has contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and other local public representatives. The landlord says that they are trying to do what is right and do not want to make their tenants homeless but that everyone seems utterly powerless to make a decision. It is a real failure if the tenant in situ scheme does not work where landlord and tenant work together to try to make it work. We call on the Government to do the right thing, to ramp up the tenant in situ scheme and to adopt the other constructive measures we in Labour propose in this motion to ensure we see the introduction of an emergency public house-building programme on public land, to commence rapid compulsory purchase of vacant derelict properties and to endorse and rapidly progress Labour's Bills. We have put forward a Housing (Homeless Families) Bill, a renters' rights Bill and a Kenny report Bill. That legislation, taken together, would really help to address the housing crisis. Lastly, we are disappointed that the Government, instead of taking on board these constructive measures, has put forward a countermotion or amendment to our motion. We regret that and ask the Government to consider withdrawing its countermotion, take on our constructive proposals for change and ensure we can work together to address this utter scourge, this most pressing social issue of our time.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	310	I am pleased to second the Labour Party motion. The housing crisis is the single biggest social and, now, economic challenge facing this society. I am on record as having made that very point in recent years in this House, that housing is not alone a social challenge but also a vast economic challenge. I predicted what IBEC has said in recent weeks, that our housing challenge is now a challenge to foreign direct investment. If Ministers or the Government are not necessarily concerned about the length of the housing list, at least if they are concerned about the direction of the economy then that should force greater action in addressing our housing lists and the housing calamity we face, which is what it is. The Minister of State is only too familiar with this issue because it occupies a huge amount of his time too as a constituency Deputy. It is the biggest issue we all face in our constituency offices day in and day out and when we meet constituents on the street. Day in and day out we deal with the harrowing cases of families who simply have no place to call home, children living in homeless hubs and people worried sick about eviction notices, often dodgy ones, hitting the mat after being threatened by a landlord. They are fearful because they simply will not have anywhere to go. When they look on daft.ie they find that there are two or three properties available in the community in which they live. The trauma of a child losing the only place they have known as home from the day they were born is very real. That stays with a child and a family throughout their lives. The provision of housing is a highly charged political issue and it is correct that it is so because it goes to the heart of how our society is organised. Our different approaches illustrate the difference between the competing philosophies across this Chamber. The Labour Party never seeks to exploit this as a political issue for mere expediency. The issue, we believe, is far too serious for narrow point-scoring, and that would do the people who need homes a huge disservice. Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on Leaders' Questions today recognised as much in response to remarks my party colleague, the Labour Party leader, Deputy Bacik, made that the Labour Party always seeks to be constructive in respect of housing policy and housing delivery. If a policy is working, we will say so, but the Government's policy simply is not. Housing for All is not working. The very first line of the Government's amendment, which we would prefer it did not table, reads "Housing for All ... is working". It is as if the Government believes that if it repeats that enough times, it will enter the public consciousness and will somehow become fact. In anyone's language it is not working. It is not working because this Government is a record-breaker, and not in a good way. It is a record-breaker on homelessness, a record breaker on rents and a record breaker on house prices. In the few months since the Government was dragged kicking and screaming into introducing a short-term eviction ban, it simply has not used that time to make things demonstrably better. There has been more wasted time and more missed opportunities as the Government carries on regardless with a policy whereby housing targets are manifestly too low and too few social and affordable homes, and indeed private homes through the market, will be built while the crisis becomes a disaster for far too many people - and it is a disaster. The silver bullet is not working and there is no shame in the Government admitting that and changing course. In doing so and accepting that, the Government could show some humility. That kind of humility, in the context of the challenge we face, would be welcomed. Even the Taoiseach, in his role as commentator on the housing calamity, accepts that the Government's targets are too low. Why is the senior Minister in the Department dragging his feet on reviewing and updating those targets, saying in response to our motion that the review will take place only once the final official census figures are available? The Minister of State knows as well as I do that the final figures are rarely discernibly different from the preliminary data, which have been available since the middle of last year, so there is nothing stopping the Government from carrying out that review now. Our motion recognises the logic of the expert Housing Commission's analysis. We call for what we believe to be a modest but appropriate 50,000 new builds each year. That would include a doubling of delivery of social and affordable homes. That is 20,000 homes more than what the Government is prepared to admit is required. The single most important thing the State can do to address supply and affordability and to damp down the unsustainable madness in the private rental market is to get back into the business of building high-quality public housing at scale. I looked today at the data for my local authority. One social home has been allocated in the town of Drogheda, Ireland's biggest town, with a population of 46,000, in the month of January - one social home. That is absolutely disgraceful. The list in County Louth is at 5,000 now. The social housing builds data for last year still have not been published, but we know from estimates by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform that the target is likely to have been missed by 2,500 homes. What does that mean? It means, more than likely, 2,500 renters will still be on the housing assistance payment, still with no security and left with the fear of the eviction notice. Again, that is a plan that is not working. We call again in this motion for real action on vacancy and dereliction.Tackling vacant homes and derelict properties, the Minister of State will admit and acknowledge, is the first place we should start when it comes to housing supply. It is the very definition of low-hanging fruit. It restores communities and re-establishes local pride. Properties can be easily reconnected to services and the environmental and climate argument, as well as economic and business case, for doing so is very compelling. However, what the Government published last week was a vacant homes plan that is really hard to take seriously. Why? The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, published a plan to bring vacant homes back into use with no targets. There are no targets for 2023 and no targets for local authorities year on year. How can we have any confidence in a plan that is devoid of targets? If the Minister was confident of his plan and his policy approach, he would put front and centre the targets required of local authorities each year and what he is prepared to do. He would be prepared to measure it. When one looks at that alongside the tokenism in the Finance Bill presented after the budget, with the announcement of a vacant homes tax which is derisory and will not bring a single home to market and a vacant sites tax which is far from punitive, then one really wonders about this Government's commitment on vacancy and dereliction. I would advise the Minister of State, officials in the Department and the Minister to take a closer look at the remarkable work done by officials of Louth County Council in recent years in terms of compulsorily purchasing vacant and derelict properties and bringing them back into use.  In the couple of minutes I have left I want to refer to the tenant in situ scheme and the matter of the eviction ban. We are all familiar with the tenant in situ scheme. We have used it and have proposed that landlords in our constituencies would use it and that the local authorities would use it to prevent people from falling into homelessness and they have done that. My understanding is that there was a limit of 200 homes for acquisition placed on the local authorities last year but that changed towards the end of the year. It is a good scheme. It has real potential but it is not being used enough. The information I have is that there is inconsistency in the application of the scheme across local authorities. It is very much dependent on the determination of a director of housing or other staff to use it and there is far too much red tape in an emergency. I am dealing with landlords at the moment who want to use this scheme but are still waiting for answers from local authorities. These are good landlords, and there is such a thing as good landlords, decent people who want to help the people living in the properties that they own. They want to move on. They may want to sell the house and are talking to local authorities but it is very difficult to move things on. I agree with the sentiments in the motion that we need monthly reporting. Again, it is about monitoring progress and monitoring developments and having the metrics so we can measure the success or otherwise of schemes. That is what makes good public policy. In conclusion, I want to make reference to the eviction ban itself. Put simply, it needs to be extended. Why? The reason is that the same conditions that existed when the Minister was dragged, kicking and screaming, into introducing an eviction ban in the first place still exist. We have core inflation of 8%. The Minister for Finance confirmed that to me yesterday in the Dáil. He is concerned about it, as are all of us here. One way in which the Government can assist renters in very difficult situations is to ensure that the eviction ban is extended. Government should then use that time, over the next few months, to get things right because it did not use the last few months to get things right. That is why the Labour Party tabled this motion in the Dáil this evening.

and— having regard to progress already made, the Housing for All action plan commits to reviewing the national housing targets and projections when the full Census 2022 is published in May this year, with refreshed targets (with subsets for social, affordable and market delivery) reflecting need and demand, and scaling-up to ensure optimal levels of sustainable supply over the lifetime of the plan in line with increased capacity in the construction sector;acknowledges that 2022 is the first full year of affordable housing delivery in a generation, and increasing the supply of affordable homes is key to improving our housing system, which will be achieved through a mix of new or extended initiatives, including the 'First Home' Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, the Help to Buy initiative and the expanded Local Authority Home Loan schemes; further acknowledges that, with regards to tackling supply and affordability issues in the rental market:— Cost Rental housing, a new form of State-backed secure, long-term rental tenure with rents targeted at a minimum of 25 per cent below open market rates, is being delivered at scale and hundreds of Cost Rental homes are now tenanted;— the Government will commission a comprehensive review of the private rental sector, to take account of the significant regulatory changes over the past several years and secure an efficient, affordable, safe, and secure framework for landlords and tenants, and will be completed by the end of June 2023;— tenancy protections have been enhanced, with increased rent caps in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), restricted deposit amounts, extended notice periods, and tenancies of unlimited duration;— crucially, the period from the date of receipt of a 'no fault' Notice of Termination for a tenant to submit a dispute to the Residential Tenancies Board for resolution has also been increased from 28 days to 90 days; and— to tackle accommodation shortages, the Government is strengthening regulatory controls on short-term lets with a ban on the advertising of non-principal private residences in RPZs for short-term letting purposes, where the necessary planning permission is not in place;further recognises that, with regard to vacant properties:— bringing vacant homes into use is a key Government priority and real progress is being made, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week published the Vacant Homes Action Plan 2023-2026, which outlines this progress and details new actions that will be implemented to continue to return as many vacant properties back to use as possible, increasing the supply of housing available, and revitalising local communities;— measures already taken by the Government include expanding the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, funding full-time vacant homes officers in every local authority, exemptions to planning permissions to convert vacant commercial premises to residential use, and enhancing the Nursing Homes Support/Fair Deal Scheme to incentivise the selling or renting of unused homes; and— while the overall trend in vacancy rates is downwards, work is continuing to bring as many vacant properties into use as possible, with measures included in the action plan such as a €150 million Urban Regeneration and Development Fund for local authorities to acquire vacant or derelict properties and sites for re-use or sale, and to ensure homes don’t lie vacant, a new local authority-led programme is being developed to help them buy or compulsory purchase vacant homes in their areas and resell them on the open market; andfurthermore acknowledges that, with regard to addressing homelessness: — the number of people accessing homeless supports is a serious concern for the Government, and this is being actively addressed by:— increasing social and residential housing supply, as this is key to eradicating homelessness, and guaranteed State investment of over €4 billion a year in housing is aimed at increasing supply;— funding of over €215 million being put in place to deliver homeless prevention measures, emergency accommodation, and support households to successfully exit homelessness, an increase of 10 per cent on 2022; and— commencing critical initiatives, which include a new voids programme with increased funding, a reinstated delegated sanction allowing local authorities pursue appropriate acquisitions, and modifications to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, opening up more opportunities to include conversion of commercial units to residential, and increasing the number of Housing First tenancies for those entrenched in homelessness;— while Government has legislated to protect renters facing homelessness by preventing 'no fault' tenancy terminations from taking place this winter, the long-term answer to these accommodation challenges remains an increased and sustainable supply of new homes, such as through the State-led expanded social and affordable housing programmes operating under Housing for All;— the Government continues to closely monitor the operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2022; and— Housing for All recognises the particular challenges of homelessness for children and their families and sets out actions for them to exit homelessness, and work is underway to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness that have complex support needs, to provide them with enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to help them exit homelessness and maintain their homes."Nothing is more important to this Government than tackling the housing crisis head on. I accept that challenges remain but it is also important to acknowledge the significant progress that is being and has been made since the publication of Housing for All in September 2021. The Labour Party’s motion does not recognise this progress and that is why we have put forward our countermotion today. I accept the points made by Deputies Bacik and Nash on working together, which is important. The Government is happy to give consideration to constructive proposals to address the housing crisis and any such proposals are most welcome. Housing for All is the single biggest intervention that has been made in housing in the history of the State. The secured and sustained levels of investment are unparalleled. They will support delivery of at least 300,000 new homes by 2030. We will build on the substantial progress of 2022 and deliver more than 9,000 direct-build social homes and 5,500 affordable homes. Some €1.3 billion will be spent on affordability measures and supporting home ownership in 2023. Increasing supply is key to resolving the challenges facing housing in this country. This Government is tackling it head-on and by any objective measure, is doing so successfully. Almost 30,000 homes were built last year. That is an increase of 45% on 2021 delivery, or an additional 5,251 new homes beyond our Housing for All target of 24,600 for the year. There remains a very strong pipeline of delivery in place for 2023 with nearly 27,000 commencement notices received in 2022 and more than 40,000 homes granted planning permission in the 12 months to September. We are ahead of our supply numbers plan to date and I am confident that this will continue right throughout 2023, despite the many challenges which we face. The Labour Party motion calls on the Dáil to recognise that a generation of young people are locked out of home ownership or secure and affordable tenancies. However, it is important to put on the record of the House some of the key measures that have already been brought forward to address the affordability challenges faced. We have established the First Home shared equity scheme to help people who are stuck in a rental trap to buy their own home. We have expanded the local authority home loan and also extended the help to buy scheme, with up to €30,000 available for first-time buyers. We introduced a renter's tax credit worth €500 for each renter in budget 2023. The first affordable purchase homes in well over a decade were delivered through local authorities last year and the fresh start principle has been established in State housing schemes to support divorced and separated people. We have also made cost rental a reality, with hundreds of tenants now in homes with rents at least 25% below the market price. We will see a further 1,850 cost-rental tenancies come on stream in 2023. Of course, as I said, challenges remain. The past year has seen some extraordinary challenges arising from the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and rising interest rates. Although Housing for All is a comprehensive plan that covers all aspects of the housing system, the Government has to be both proactive and pragmatic when it comes to emerging issues. It was important to build in provisions to make sure the plan continues to be relevant over its lifetime and a focus kept on the core issues and challenges we face. It is a living plan. To this end, we have committed to review Housing for All annually. We published the first review of the plan in November 2022. The updated plan identifies 33 priority actions to directly or indirectly support the supply of well-built, sustainable homes for people up and down the country. It will activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply and deliver on the fundamental reforms set out in the plan.
Housing for All currently sets out annual targets of overall housing delivery to 2030. This clearly shows a building up towards 40,000 homes per year. It is disingenuous to suggest we can simply double targets and delivery overnight. That is wholly unrealistic, misleading, and helps no one. I note the Labour Party motion suggests a target of 50,000. Nobody is suggesting 30,000 homes is enough to meet our current needs but it is a significant first step as we build capacity within the construction sector to help us meet our housing needs. We have committed to reviewing Housing for All targets. Revised targets will be informed by the full census data when it published in May this year. We will take full account of the significant changes in the economic and social landscape since Housing for All only 16 months ago. Regarding the private rental sector, the Labour Party motion calls on Government to enact the Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021. The motion does not acknowledge the legislative changes the Government has already introduced to enhance tenancy protections, including capping rent increases in rent pressure zones, restricting deposit amounts, extending notice periods, and introducing tenancies of unlimited duration. There is still more that needs to be done and I acknowledge we need to increase the supply of rental properties into the sector. To help us do this, and to secure an efficient, affordable, safe and secure framework for landlords and tenants, we have commenced a comprehensive review of the private rental sector to take account the significant regulatory changes over the past several years. The review will be completed by the end of June this year. In relation to bringing back vacant dwellings for re-use, we recently published a new vacant homes action plan and launched a new €150 million fund for local authorities to tackle vacancy and dereliction to support the plan. We introduced a new grant of up to €50,000 for vacant and derelict properties nationwide to help people with the cost of buying these homes. We are also developing a new programme to help local authorities to buy or compulsorily purchase vacant homes in their areas and resell them on the open market. Reducing and preventing homelessness remains a top priority for the Government. Increasing supply, particularly supply of new social homes, will be key to addressing homelessness. In 2021, 9,183 social homes were delivered. When verified and published in the coming months, figures will show that more social housing new builds have been delivered in 2022 than in any year in the last half a century.In budget 2023, we allocated over €215 million in funding to deliver homeless prevention measures and emergency accommodation and to support households to exit homelessness successfully, an increase of 10% on 2022. We also introduced a winter eviction ban, which the Labour Party motion calls on the Government to extend to the end of 2023. We do not take these measures lightly or without fully considering their potential impact; responsible Government simply does not have the luxury of doing so. The winter eviction ban is a short-term emergency measure. It affords time for increased housing supply to come on stream and to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market. While there are currently no proposals to bring forward further legislative proposals, we continue to monitor closely the operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts and further measures that might be required while further additional supply comes on stream. The motion also call on the Government to endorse and rapidly progress Labour's Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017. Housing for All recognises the particular challenges of homelessness for children and their families and sets out actions to support them to exit homelessness. The existing system provides for the emergency accommodation needs of homeless families with children. The current homeless assessment arrangements give housing authorities the flexibility to respond to the various needs of families who present to them, and housing authorities make every reasonable effort to address their accommodation needs with enhanced tenancy sustainment supports. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I, together with my colleagues across Government, fully appreciate the scale of the challenges facing the country. However, we are making substantial progress and we will continue to do so. I can assure the House we are fully committed to addressing the challenges ahead in Housing for All and that it remains central to our success. I look forward to the contributions from Deputies. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will close the debate for the Government.

This inspired her to go into politics. She became Minister for Education and delivered radical reforms in that space and inspired people like me to turn to politics. Probably Deputy Nash and I were afforded the opportunity to go to third level because of her radical abolition of fees at that time. I was inspired by what Niamh used to talk about in terms of her school life. It was similar to my own circumstances because, when it came to education, housing was everything. Niamh could only achieve so much with the children who she taught and I could only achieve so much with the children that I taught within the classroom because there was a reality outside of the school which was the homes in which these children lived. There is a middle-class middle-Ireland assumption of how every child lives and it does not equate to the most disadvantaged of communities. Even as the President brings forward this radical suggestion of the abolition of homework and others have talked about it, there is a middle-Ireland assumption of what homework is and how homework is done. I remember, in my school days and school teaching days, the reality of homework was that a child did not have the space in his or her home to do homework. They did not have a desk in their room. They had to do it lying on the floor. Often they had to do it on the stairs because of the overcrowded reality in which they were living. This was 20 years ago, around the time that Fianna Fáil had the brainwave to stop building social housing. Today when I go into classrooms and I talk to children about the nature of education and issues in society and they talk to me about homework, I talk about how sometimes it is difficult for children to do homework because of the homes in which they live. I always see a child whose head bows because he or she knows I am speaking to his or her reality. This is not only me talking about my experiences talking to children. This is me referencing cold, hard figures. The cold, hard figures from last December are that not only do we have 11,000 people in homelessness, but almost 3,500 of those are children. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, can only imagine the life that one will lead if one starts off life in that insecurity of homelessness. We always talk about situations in our own constituency. Last Christmas, my colleague, Councillor Brian McDonagh, and I had to deal with a situation of a mother who was giving birth and had nowhere to go when she left the maternity hospital at Christmas time. In Ireland, one of the richest countries in the world, she had nowhere to go after she had this baby and we had to intervene. We did not do media on it, we did not send out press releases on it but the reality of my office in that week was trying to get somebody with a newborn baby somewhere to live in emergency accommodation for three months. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Government will celebrate the fact that it brought in an eviction ban. The Minister of State trumpeted it in his remarks. The Government resisted it for months. We had people in the Minister of State's position who told us that it was potentially unconstitutional and that the Government had to get the Attorney General's advice. We begged the Government for months and months to bring in the eviction ban and the Government stated it was potentially unconstitutional even though it had been done in 2015. I ask the Minister of State not come here and read out successes that the Department apparently has in terms of its housing response. We begged the Government to do it and we are begging the Minister of State today to do it because we cannot have that insecurity of children, 3,500 of whom are in homelessness, insecure accommodation or insecure rental situations whose mothers and fathers are telephoning us saying that they cannot live like this. The Minister of State will be aware that Barnardos says that 29% of parents are skipping meals to feed their children. Therefore, we have insecurity of food on top of insecurity of housing and the Minister of State is playing around with language about an eviction ban. Let us do now, today, what the Minister of State knows he will do anyway, that is, extend the eviction ban to the end of the year. I ask the Minister of State to realise the nature of the grinding punishment we are all meting out on children when they start their lives like this. It is just not fair.

If only words could build houses. We are tabling another motion tonight because, despite all the plans, the schemes and all the announcements that have been rehearsed again tonight in the Minister of State's speech, the situation for families and individuals in all our constituencies remains dire and everybody in this House knows that. Housing is the number one issue. It is the one issue we face every day in all our constituency offices - people facing eviction. People with decent jobs who have a decent income are coming into us but it is impossible to find a place to rent. There is fear in their eyes when they are talking to you and you know in your heart there is probably nothing you can do for them. These are people on low and fixed incomes desperate to find a place to live and knowing, looking at the rental cost around them, that would be impossible. I spoke to one retired man this week who has been a long-term renter with a decent landlord. He understood and accepted that the landlord needed to sell the house but after years of living in the house that was his home, this retired person on a pension has now been thrown into a market that is hopeless for him. He only looks at what can be afforded. He went to one place and he told me that it was like a converted shed. That was the only place that was in his price range. That is shocking. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, means well and what he said is genuinely an attempt to solve the problems but his approach this evening, and that of the senior Minister, in tabling an amendment here is quite shocking. It is unacceptable. It is a self-congratulatory amendment, instead of saying that we have a collective problem that we need to resolve and what can we all do collectively putting our shoulders to the wheel to bring immediate relief to as many people as possible. It is not business as usual in this.Responding to our eight specific proposals with a self-congratulatory amendment is to deny the crisis that we all know is real for our people. All is not well. The schemes and announcements are not working. I wish to focus on our proposal No. 4. We can see vacant and derelict properties in all our villages, towns, cities and rural areas. I could bring the Minister of State on a tour of Wexford and point them out. Some have been derelict for years on end, including large buildings like former convents. We need a sense of urgency about bringing these back into useful service as homes for our people. We need to set real targets for local authorities, with an underscored demand that they must be met - in essence, a mobilisation of the State, both local and national, in the same way and with the same intensity, zeal and focus that was brought to bear in dealing with the Covid crisis. That is what is needed as well as everything else. The policies of the Government will, over time, bring results, but we also need to solve the problems that people are experiencing now. The anguish in the eyes of the people the Minister of State and every other Deputy, including me, are meeting in our constituencies needs to be met with real solutions and a sense of urgency. I ask that the Minister of State revert to his senior colleague and ask him to withdraw the self-congratulatory amendment that all is well and all the schemes are marvellous and working, denying the reality we know is facing many people on the ground. Instead of that amendment, the Minister should take these eight proposals from the Labour Party and a dozen more from Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats and everyone else to solve the problem collectively as best we can. If that national sense of urgency and commitment was brought to bear in the same way as we faced down Covid and previous economic crises, we would have done a good day's work today.

While there might be some minor differences on the details of the policy proposals, we are more than happy to support the motion. I do not know where to start. At an earlier stage in this Dáil, I was one of many on the Opposition benches who would have given the Minister of State the benefit of the doubt. I would have said he was a decent person who meant well, but what he is saying is not true. Even he does not believe the remarks he read out. The fact that he could hardly make eye contact with any of us as he read the script he was given demonstrates that he does not believe it. He said that substantial progress had been made. Let me describe that substantial progress. The Government has been in office for two and a half years, which will be half of its term if it goes for the full term, and the situation has never been worse. House prices are higher than they have ever been and they are continuing to rise. Private sector output exceeded its expectations last year, but commencements were down in the last quarter of the year and it is unlikely that we will see much progress this year. Rents have never been as high and are still rising, and for six years in a row, the private rental sector is contracting. There is no action or plan from the Government to address any of this. This week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage launched yet another glossy brochure - 32 pages long, it was issued late in the evening - telling us about all of the progress in quarter 4 of last year except for two crucial points. There was no update on social housing targets for 2022 and there was no update on affordable housing delivery. For all his sins, the former Minister, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, at least included the figures when he published his quarterly updates and he put himself in front of a committee for questions, which is something that the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, studiously avoids doing. When we get the figures, we will know that it will not have been the case that the Government exceeded the historic high of social housing output of 1975, when 8,800 real social homes were added to the stock. At most, the Government hit 7,500. According to the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, it was 6,500. I suspect it was somewhere between the two. Regardless, it will have been far off the highest number of real social houses in the past 50 years. Regarding affordable housing, it actually looks like the Government might not have delivered a single affordable purchase home last year. In my constituency, some had been laying vacant since August, but because the Department could not sort out conveyancing and legal issues with the banks, they were not purchased until the start of this year. The cost-rental scheme is in crisis. It will not have met its targets last year and will not this year either. Not only have we the highest levels of official homelessness, but all other categories of homelessness have gone through the roof as well. Approximately 18,000 people are in various forms of emergency accommodation funded by various Departments or none at all. This is not even to mention the rough sleepers. The fact that homelessness is increasing at a time when the Government has introduced a ban on evictions should send alarm bells ringing like never before. We know the reasons for this. We are not getting a consistent approach to the tenants in situ scheme. We have not had the circular from the Minister to local authorities insisting on the presumption to buy that I called for last year. The tenants in situ scheme is not being extended to cost rental so that residents in properties like Tathony House can avoid eviction. Crucially, we are not getting an emergency response from the Government mobilising emergency powers in planning, suspending procurement rules and using new building technologies to increase and accelerate additional social housing units during the period of the ban. Mr. Eoghan Murphy was no great housing Minister, but at least when he applied a ban on evictions, it was also a ban on notices to quit. The current Minister could not even do that. Not only will there be a cliff edge come 1 April for the notices in the system, but the fact that landlords have been able to continue issuing "no fault" evictions during that period means the cliff edge will be deeper and more dangerous for thousands of people. We need an emergency intervention. We need the kinds of measures outlined in this motion, including the extension of the ban on evictions. Crucially, we need increased and accelerated delivery of social housing. If we do not get that quickly, we will be looking at official homeless figures of 12,000 or 13,000, never mind all the other people the Government refuses to count and acknowledge in its figures. It is time for the Minister to spend less time launching glossy brochures that tell us nothing, tinkering around the edges with existing schemes and avoiding Oireachtas scrutiny in this Chamber and at our committee and to accept that his plan is failing and we need a change in approach. Without that, the situation will not only not get better. It will get much worse.

Despite me pointing it out in the Chamber a number of times, the fact that the number of people who are classed as homeless is an under-representation remains unchanged. If the Government's figures are based on those who fit the criteria to be considered homeless by local authorities, it is falling short of the mark. In Tipperary alone, the county council is doing its best to provide for people in need of emergency housing, but there is a feeling that we are just treading water. Last year, Tipperary County Council was made aware of 300 notices to quit, which has been described as a large number by the local housing authority. This is the kind of pressure the council is under. There has been no real progress in the homeless figures in Tipperary. Whatever spin the Minister may like to put on it, people are still struggling. It is fair to say that the opportunity to make an impact on homeless numbers that the eviction ban offered him has not been used effectively. There has been no improvement for people in Tipperary or nationally. The figures have continued to increase. We have been consistent in calling for a three-year ban on rent increases and a full month's rent back into every private renter's pocket. That call stands and is needed now more than it ever was, but our policy of accelerating the delivery of social and affordable housing must accompany it. The Government's target has been missed three years in a row. Its housing targets need to be revised. Social and affordable housing targets must be increased to at least 20,000 per year. This means increasing direct capital investment to councils and approved housing bodies in order to deliver 12,000 social houses and 8,000 genuinely affordable houses per year. As part of this, we need at least 4,000 affordable purchase homes per year. Another issue that the Minister needs to address is the anomaly in the increase in income thresholds for social housing. Tipperary is an outlier, with lower thresholds than nearly all of the counties surrounding it. This puts home hunters in Tipperary at a disadvantage. It makes no sense for one county to have a different rate applied to it than is applied to the surrounding counties. The county council wants its threshold increased.The Minister of State will be aware of this request and I ask him to consider it again. People need permanent social homes. We can see the result of the haphazard approach taken by the Government and its predecessors, highlighted by the fact that, despite an eviction ban being in effect, homelessness continues to increase. The Government failed to reach its initial 2022 social housing targets. For the sake of the people in my constituency and around the country, the Government must put its party political misgivings aside, listen to the solutions offered on this side of the House and act in the interest of the 11,632 people who are classed as homeless and the others we have not even included in this data.

Despite very low targets, councils are struggling to provide homes. There are almost 7,000 people on the housing waiting list in Kildare, with a wait of ten to 12 years. My office is inundated with inquiries from people who are couch-surfing, travelling between friends and relatives on different nights of the week to get a few hours sleep. There are 52 properties for rent advertised on daft.ie today in Kildare, none of which are within standard limits for a housing assistance payment. There are ten properties in Laois and 11 in Offaly, again none of which are within the HAP limits. We are in this crisis because successive Governments have treated a roof over someone's head as a commodity to be left to the mercy of the market. Homes should be provided on the basis of need, not greed. It is clear that subsidising landlords through the housing assistance payment is not working and landlords are finding many ways to avoid accepting HAP tenants. We are all aware of this from our offices. Social and affordable housing targets have been missed for the third year in a row. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage failed to spend hundreds of millions of euro allocated to it last year. We in Sinn Féin have solutions. I and my colleague, Teachta Ó Broin, have met Kildare County Council. It is up for the challenge, but needs quicker funding decisions, less red tape and more certainty. There are too many subsidies for developers. It is time to change the focus to first-time buyers, those in second relationships and people who are struggling to find a roof over their heads. Social and affordable housing targets must be increased to at least 20,000 units a year. Renters need help. Rents are too high. In government Sinn Féin would introduce a three year ban on rent increases and put a full month's rent back into every private renter's pocket. We will treat homelessness, like the emergency it is and accelerate the delivery of social and affordable homes. We must move away from the mistakes of the past. We must again build public homes on public land.

Every metric we have heard today shows that it is not. The social and affordable housing targets, even with them being too low, are being missed. It is now the third year in a row they have not been met. We all know that is completely unacceptable. We must increase the amount of social and affordable housing. That is clear. We must increase those targets to at least 20,000 properties. We must fund local authorities to do that job. It is clear the private sector is not capable of doing it. As has been said, Sinn Féin would protect renters. A message was sent to me a few minutes ago from a site that shows a room being rented with plastic sheeting as the wall. That is where we are at the moment. That is what the rental market looks like. People are so desperate they are renting anything because the only alternative is the streets. We need the ban on evictions to be extended. In all our offices we have people coming to us on a weekly basis, terrified about what they are facing at the end of March, beginning of April because they know there is nothing out there for them. It is critical the ban be extended. I will give one caveat. I have a constituent who rented her home when she emigrated. She has come back to work in one of the areas we need people to come back to. A caveat is needed for people who return from outside the country. They must be outside the eviction ban, but the person who is in that kind of home should be given a special provision or support from the council to avoid them ending up homeless. A few caveats are needed, especially that one as it is difficult to deal with. We need emergency legislation to deal with planning for social and affordable housing and to look at different building methods to ensure it can be done as quickly as possible. We are doing it currently. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's office is using special legislation to do that. It is something we must consider for the provision of social and affordable housing. People are angry. We see people on the streets every day. They are angry about the housing situation. They are misdirecting some of their anger because it should be directed here, at those seats opposite me. That is where the blame lies for people in homelessness and for people not being able to afford to buy or rent a home. It lies with the people who have been in power for the past two and half or three years. We have been told the housing crisis has been solved. It is clear it has not. Tens of thousands of people cannot afford anywhere to live. That must be solved and it must be done quickly.

It is important for those living in the flats across inner city Dublin, for the people living in Nicholas Street, Ross Road and Bride Street. So many people have lost so much because of the overcrowded conditions in their homes. Flats are overcrowded and neglected by the Government. Two and three generations are living under one small roof. Dampness and mould are impacting many people. The Government is overwhelmed by the issues facing residents living in the likes of Leo Fitzgerald House and Digges Street. If it was not overwhelmed, the Government would do something about it, but it is not doing anything. There are no signs that it is committed to changing the lives and conditions of people living in flat complexes. There is very little evidence to suggest that is the case. The Government is happy to increase the number of people living in inner city communities, but it has no interest in increasing the facilities and services available to those same local communities. Neglect of inner city communities will be the legacy of this Government. Neglect of those living in flat complexes will be the legacy of this Government. Investment in inner city communities and in the flat complexes is needed. We need direct intervention by the Government to co-ordinate and ringfence funding for the redevelopment of the flat complexes. We also need to focus on the delivery of social and affordable homes, as has been mentioned. Not enough is being done to accelerate the delivery of social and affordable housing. Residents are concerned about the slow rate of development of the Ringsend and Irishtown Glass Bottle site. I met the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group last night. It is concerned that the affordable homes will not be affordable. Prices of apartments on the Glass Bottle site that have been mentioned are in the region of €650,000. That is hardly affordable. With the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, due to be dissolved in 2025, residents request that the 20% stake NAMA has in the Glass Bottle Site be transferred to Dublin City Council and ringfenced for affordable homes on the Glass Bottle site in order to nudge the cost towards affordability. Will the Minister of State commit to this happening? It is doable and it must be done. I also reiterate the many calls for the extension of the eviction ban. Today my office received four calls from tenants who are facing eviction at the start of April. People talk about a cliff. It is scary for people. People are at their wits' end and it will be unacceptable if the Government does not extend the eviction ban.

Many renters now find themselves in a precarious position as the deadline for the end of the eviction ban is fast approaching. It is set to end on 1 April 2023.People are feeling fearful and vulnerable and for many the uncertainty as to whether they will have a place to live after March is putting them under undue stress and anxiety. Without question, there needs to be an extension of the eviction ban. This is crucial and the Government will recognise that this has to happen, in particular at a time when unprecedented numbers of men, women and children are homeless. We are also now living in a time of misinformation and extreme prejudice which can only increase if more families are forced out of their rental properties into homelessness should the eviction ban not be extended. An increase in the number of homeless families will only feed into the lies, misrepresentation and misinformation being spread by extreme right-wing elements. More people potentially going into homelessness and fewer properties being available to rent as landlords leave the rental sector when the ban ends will only add fuel to the fire of an already volatile situation, which will be exploited by right-wing elements. If the Government is not already aware of this, it should be and should take measures to avoid such a situation occurring. One obvious measure is to extend the eviction ban. However, these problems have existed for a long time and the Government policy, Housing for All, is failing and missing its target for the delivery of the large-scale social and affordable projects that are urgently needed. The Government is in denial about this. People are emigrating because of the cost of living and affordability crises. Perhaps the Government should take notice of that, because it is the most common thing people say when emigrating. For years, we have had a dysfunctional housing system with tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists for up to 15 years. The rental sector is contracting by the week as landlords leave it. Those properties available to rent often carry exorbitant rents which are out of the reach of most people. Action is required to tackle runaway rents by imposing a three-year ban on rent increases. I urge the Minister of State and his party to act and address, as a matter of urgency, the serious concerns I have outlined and not bury their heads in the sand in denial.

It contains a number of sensible proposals and measures which we are happy to support. We would go a little bit further in some areas, but that is a matter of detail. The fact that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has not shown up for this important debate says a lot about his attitude to the housing crisis and disaster. The fact that we are not surprised he has not shown up shows how he has engaged with the Oireachtas since becoming Minister. He made a rare appearance at the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with Estimates, but he will not come to the committee to provide updates or answer questions. On that occasion, I asked him how much money from this year was unspent and sent back to central Exchequer funds. He would not provide an answer. I submitted a written question on that, which he has not answered. Today, I asked him about it in the Dáil and he would not answer. Thankfully, due to a report published by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, we have an estimate that €241 million from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was unspent in 2022 and is being returned to Exchequer funds. The Department and Minister would not answer questions on that, despite the fact I asked the Minister today whether the figure was accurate. Thanks to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Parliamentary Budget Office, we have those figures. The Department and Minister should answer that question. We have the right to know about that and have accountability from the senior Minister. What could we have done in 2022 if the €240 million that is being returned to central Exchequer funds had instead been spent on building housing? Affordable purchase homes can be constructed with a subsidy of about €50,000, which means we could have delivered almost 5,000 such homes for people all over the country, homes which are badly needed. I will put that in context. One of the most successful affordable purchase housing schemes in this country, Marino, was built 100 years ago. It is in my constituency and is an incredibly successful and cohesive community to this day. It was well planned and designed. The money that is being sent back to the Exchequer this year which the Minister failed to spend is the equivalent of four Marinos being delivered. Let us think of the difference that would make to our housing disaster and the families who would benefit from such housing. Families would no longer worry about being evicted from the private rental sector and uprooting their children from school and then having to make new friends and settle into a new school. If the money had been spent, rather than being returned to central Exchequer funds, it would have made a significant difference. That €241 million does not include the €340 million we know for certain was not spent in 2022 and is instead being carried over into 2023. What could we have done with that? Social homes are delivered by a mix of loans from the Housing Finance Agency and direct capital funding. The money could have provided in the region of 4,000 social homes. What a difference that would make to people in insecure HAP tenancies, those paying rents in the private rental sector they cannot afford and people living in box rooms, overcrowded conditions and in homeless emergency accommodation, all of whom could have moved into social housing tenancies. The €340 million that was not spent and was instead carried over into this year could and should have made a significant difference to all of those individuals and families. It could have taken pressure off the private rental sector and benefited everyone else. How on earth does the Government justify leaving hundreds of millions of euro that should have been spent on housing last year unspent? There is, of course, no mention of that in the Government's counter motion or contribution to the debate, which was self congratulatory and told us how great it is. It is a slap in the face of everybody affected by the housing disaster that the money was not spent and invested in building homes that could have removed people from stress.  The Government's countermotion and comments during the debate stated Housing for All is working. How could the Minister of State say that? We have the highest ever rents, house prices and number of people living in homeless emergency accommodation. We have the highest ever number of people in their 20s and 30s still stuck in their childhood bedrooms. We have the highest ever amount of money left unspent by any Government that was allocated for housing. They are appalling records on housing, yet the Minister of State has told us Housing for All is working. How can he say that? We continuously heard the Government narrative from the Taoiseach before Christmas, and again yesterday, that there is a housing problem everywhere and the grass is not greener for people who go elsewhere. Even yesterday, the Taoiseach said there is a problem all over Europe. It is classic deflection. There is a housing problem in other countries, but to suggest it is as bad as here is simply not true.  Not only are rents more expensive in Dublin than in any other capital city in the European Union, data published by EUROSTAT show that the highest rent increases relative to house prices over the past 12 years anywhere in the European Union have been in Ireland.The narrative that the problem is everywhere and Ireland is the same is not true.  The answer is staring us in the face. You can walk out of here into neighbourhoods and communities close by that were built successfully as public housing in decades gone. The answer is clear in terms of what can be done regarding building social and affordable purchase housing.  The amendment to the motion tells us there will be a commission and a comprehensive review of the private rental sector. The Government has been in office for two and a half years and we have seen all the difficulties in the private rental sector so why is it only telling us now that it will look at this? Where is the action?

I will use some of my time to tell the Ministers of State about the human reality of their failures and the misery it is inflicting on people. Watching this debate at the moment is a woman called Jackie. Jackie and her husband are in their late 50s. He worked all his life and worked for a semi-State body. They have two teenage daughters, one of whom has special needs. Tomorrow they are going to be in court in front of a judge. It will probably be the first time they have ever been in front of a judge. The landlord who is evicting them on grounds of sale is seeking a District Court enforcement order to evict them. I want to underline that this eviction, and they are terrified, is happening during a so-called eviction ban. They have done nothing wrong and have paid the rent all their lives but are being evicted from the home in which their children were born and where they have lived since the 1950s. They have no options. Their income means they are over the social housing threshold so they are not entitled to HAP. They are not entitled to be on the council housing list. It is even questionable - because we have come across this and it is uncertain at the moment - whether they will be entitled to emergency accommodation because some local authorities think they are not. They have gone to the banks to see whether there is any chance they could get a mortgage to buy the home that is being sold from under them only to be told that as they are in their late 50s and will be retired when they reach 65 or 66, the banks will only give them a seven-year mortgage that they obviously could not afford to service and therefore, that is not an option for them. We rang the council to ask if there was any mortgage scheme whereby the council could help finance them to help them buy the house from the landlord who is selling it when they have lived there all their lives to be told "No". Every door is shut. They are looking on. They had hoped the senior Minister would be present. I have raised their case on multiple occasions. Jackie has just texted me now to see if there is any chance that a miracle, to use her phrase, might be found before the court hearing tomorrow because otherwise, the family will be living in their car. That is the extent of the failure. The Government now calls it the tenant in situ scheme. It has all these names; it is great. I have been asking for this for four years. I did not call it the tenant in situ scheme but I have been calling for local authorities to purchase houses when people were threatened with eviction through no fault of their own. One of the cases that led me to make that call about three or four years ago was the case of St. Helen's Court, where a vulture fund was evicting people. The sale still has not happened despite negotiations taking place. In situations like this, it is again a case of saying sorry but as they are over the social housing threshold, there is no scheme for that so the authority will not and cannot buy. This is unbelievable. You cannot tell people in that situation that you are sorry but you have nothing for them and they can go and sleep on the side of the road but that is what they are being told, so please deliver the miracle Jackie, her husband and her two children need because they are terrified about what they are facing tomorrow morning.  Another case I raised - I do not how many times - involves a young woman with a teenage son in emergency accommodation. They are sharing one bedroom between them. This woman works for a State agency looking after vulnerable children and has been in emergency accommodation for four years yet there is nothing for her because she is a bit over the threshold. They tried to evict her at one stage and we had to fight like billyo to stop her from being evicted from emergency accommodation. There was nothing on offer for her.  Another case involves a couple. The husband was working but then got early-onset Alzheimer's disease, so he cannot work any more. Prior to him getting Alzheimer's disease, they had a HAP tenancy and had to pay a top-up on that. When he was working, they could afford it but now he has Alzheimer's disease, he cannot work, his wife cannot afford the top-up and so they are falling into arrears through no fault of their own but will the Government scheme allow the council to increase the money to pay the rent so this couple do not fall into arrears, which they are now falling into? The answer is "No, sorry, the scheme doesn't allow it" so what is going to happen to them? You can add to that all the people who are paying top-ups. Every time the 4% or 2% happens, the tenants must swallow that up in top-up payments because the Government will not increase the payment. As the new HAP thresholds only apply to new tenancies, the gap between what people are supposed to be able to pay and what they are actually paying is growing all the time, leading to more people getting into trouble with arrears and it is a case of being told sorry but the scheme does not allow it. There is no flexibility.  The question is very simple. Does the Government have a commitment to stop people ending up homeless? It really is as simple as that. It can be as simple as deciding that we are not going to allow this to happen. It is not just about the eviction ban, which should be a no-brainer, although I have just told the House about the many people to whom it does not apply. The Government's position and the instructions to local authorities should be very simple. It should be that we are not allowing anybody to end up homeless and we are going to do whatever is necessary to make sure that does not happen. Nobody should be put through this misery.  I have a pile of cases involving people with extreme medical conditions. There are people whose children have desperate medical conditions and who are seeking multiple consultants and are dealing with the most horrendous situations you could imagine but when they put in for medical priority, it takes ages. Do you know how long it takes to process medical priority applications in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown? It takes about nine months. The suffering people are going through is incredible. The Government could do something about this but it is not doing it. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to do something about these cases. The Government should stop people being evicted into homelessness, control rents and do something about empty properties. The Government could do these things if the will was there but sadly it is not.

I will first declare an interest by saying that I am a landlord. The biggest issue with housing at the moment is supply. If we are going to build more houses, we need to beef up the local authorities because that seems to be the way we are going - local authorities will deliver housing. We need to beef up their resources so they can get on with acquiring the lands locally, developing the projects and getting them built. The Minister of State is new in the position and I congratulate him on getting it. It is important also he remove some of the approval processes. If a local authority comes up with a scheme, that scheme should be devolved to the local authority to be allowed to get on with it. The Department should let it go from A to Z to tender without having to come back to the Department every time it makes a move, appoints a design team that has to get approval, or applies for the planning permission to get approval to go to the next stage. That is farcical. It was needed at a time when we were trying to slow things down because we had no money. We now need to get on with it. Money is not the problem. The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, as it stands, is not fit for purpose. It is not providing enough money to the tenants given rents are rising. Once somebody goes onto HAP, he or she leaves the housing list, which is not right or fair. Moreover, the landlord is then left in a situation where if the tenant does not pay the money, the landlord will not be paid at all. I have dealt with cases where landlords have been left for years without getting rent because of the farcical way in which evictions can be carried out. I do not agree there should be an eviction ban because it is not landlords who are the problem. The problem is the lack of supply, and we have to get our heads around that and take off the shackles of all these processes if we are to deal with this as an emergency. We have to accept this situation with housing is every bit as bad as Covid. It is causing mental stress and significant problems throughout the country. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has been given the task of delivering on the national development plan. If he and the Minister for Finance will agree with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to remove all these gateway approvals for housing, and for health facilities as well, we will go some way towards speeding up the process to get more houses built. Galway County Council is doing a great job and building houses, but it could build a lot more if it had more resources in terms of staff and moneys being devolved to it in order that it could get on with it. A housing scheme that is about to go out to tender for a design team will not see construction start for at least three years. That is no good and it does not work. It is important we agree that whatever we do, it will be back to supply. We do not need blame games. Too many people are suffering because of what is going on. I do not agree with everything stated in the Labour Party motion but it gives us an opportunity to speak about housing. Likewise, I do not agree with the Government amendment, because I think it is just saying the Government is doing a great job. This is an emergency and a crisis, and while Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers are coming in at the volume they are, we have an issue with accommodating all the people we have here. We also need to expand Croí Cónaithe. I will leave it at that because I am out of time.

I have not had the opportunity to address him in his position. He is a man of some knowledge, having spent a long time in the political sphere. I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward the motion, even though I do not agree with much of it. Nevertheless, we are discussing a very important topic. The reason I do not agree with most of the motion is that, like so many of our debates on housing, it does not address the underlying problem that is the biggest part of why there is not enough housing, namely, planning policy. Every councillor in the country, including Labour Party councillors, has either drafted and passed county development plans or is in the process of doing so. What we have in this country is a one-size-fits-all planning policy, but outside the M50 a high-density planning policy does not suit rural Ireland. That is where our viability issue is. I asked the Secretary General in the Department how much it costs to build a two-bedroom apartment. All we get at minimum densities, which are high density in the countryside, at 35 dwellings per hectare, are terraced housing and apartments. We need front and back gardens and we have the room for them. We have the space to live but this is the policy that is being dictated. The Secretary General did not know the answer by the way, but without site costs it costs €250,000 to build a two-bedroom apartment, versus just €150,000 for a two-bedroom house. How does it make sense that we insist on this policy in the middle of a crisis when the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is now saying it is unlikely to be able to build the 1,214 houses it has prepared for because of commercial viability. The issue of viability has developed because of all the planning policy and all the neglect for the past ten years when houses were not being built. Our planning policy, our entire procedure, is a mess. That is not the Minister of State's fault - he is new in his position - but it has developed over successive governments. I hope he, as a new Minister of State, is going to address this issue. I assure him we can afford the land, particularly in Wexford, to have front and back gardens. Why would we build four-storey apartments with no lift shafts? Fifty-six-year-old people will turn into 76-year-old people, their hips or knees will go and then they will not be able to climb stairs. The two young departmental officials sitting beside the Minister of State will probably never own houses because if it costs €250,000 to build an apartment without site costs, it probably will not be able to be sold for less than €350,000. Who will get a mortgage for a two-bedroom apartment at that level? That leaves only one entity to buy those apartments, namely, the county councils, which means we will just corral those in society who cannot afford to buy their own home into high-density settings that will become ghettos because the county councils are well known for not maintaining their properties, especially at this juncture. I do not want to get into our history of high-density settings. We pulled them down and now we are building them back up. We are making the same mistakes again. The Government is not listening. It is not trying to resolve the problem but is throwing money at it. Eight hundred modular homes, at a cost to the State of just short of €1 billion, will not cut the mustard. It is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government. We could build houses more cheaply. We will never produce those modular homes in this country. It is insane that we would go down that road when all we have to do is look at our planning policy and make the changes that will incentivise development and ensure the commencement of planning that has been granted.

I thank also the Labour Party for bringing forward the motion. I fully support its calls to begin an emergency public housing building programme using the full resources of the State and to commence a rapid compulsory purchase of vacant properties by local authorities. We all know, however, that is not going to happen. Unfortunately, these proposals always falls on deaf ears when they reach the Government's side of the House. Some Deputies have suggested the Government is not doing things right but I think it is. It is doing things right as it sees it, and that is the crux of the problem. It does not see itself as having a role to provide housing for people who need it or who have incomes that put them above the limit. If it did, it could change those limits and include those people in the housing need, but it is not interested in that. It is interested, however, in providing money for private developers to build houses and so on, which is what it does, but it is failing even at that at the moment because they gave those huge sums back to the Minister last year because they had not been spent. The Government is failing miserably, in the most horrible way, given it significantly affects everybody's life. All we had to do was listen to what Deputy Boyd Barrett had to say, the cases he cited and the examples he gave. It reflected a lack of empathy and care that has allowed that to happen, and that is the difference. It is why we are in this situation and that is sad, but that is the reality. Until we get rid of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael from government, there will be no change in that situation.That is the reality. The housing situation in this country has become so dire, it is no wonder that so many young people are making the decision to move away. The Financial Times recently reported 495 homes were available to rent in Dublin on 1 July and only 35,000 nationwide. This is half the level that was available in 2016. This problem has been around for a long time. It has been known what to do but the Government is not doing anything. Nationwide rents rose by an average of 14.1% in the third quarter of last year compared with the same period in 2021, according to Daft.ie. This is the highest increase since it began tracking rents in 2005. Again, the Government knew this was happening and the Government did nothing.  In parts of the west of Ireland, property prices rocketed more than 16% in the year to October. It is devastating to see how this housing crisis is affecting parts of Donegal. I have constituents coming to me week after week unable to buy and left with nowhere to rent. People are in housing that is in no way adequate for them. There are disabled children or people with large numbers of children. There are people earning €28,000 a year and they cannot get on the housing list. The Government should be ashamed of itself. Those people are being left behind and I have to sit there in the office and say to them that there is nothing I can do. There is nothing I can tell them. Go away. That is a fucking disgrace but that is the reality of the situation.  There is no doubt that Housing for All has failed, and very badly failed. The announcement by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, that the return of these 78 vacant homes in Donegal has a positive impact on communities is completely misleading, as written here, but really I think it is bullshit. These vacant homes did not go anywhere, they were still owned by the council, they were just left inactive which never should have been the case in the first place. In reality, 78 houses will make no difference when there are 2,600 people on the housing waiting list. And that figure is conservative because the council massages the figures down to make it look a bit better for the Government. If the people who could not afford houses and could not afford to provide themselves with housing were actually included in the list there could easily be 10,000 on the housing list in Donegal. That is the sign of the failure of this Government and successive Governments to deal with the issue. This goes back to before the troika came into Ireland. The troika and the bailout programme accelerated the problem but they did not start it. The problem started in the 1980s with the sell-off of houses and the move out of the direct supply of housing. Every party that was in government since that time has participated in that and has allowed it to happen. It has only been accelerated because of the financial crash. All that is needed is a change in emphasis and a change in the thought process to change how it will be dealt with. Nothing will be dealt with or these issues cannot be sorted out over night or anything. Nobody is saying that they will be, but the emphasis of how we deal with things would change and it would make a huge difference to people’s lives. It would make a very real difference to people’s lives. This is costing a hell of a lot more than just not providing houses. What about the mental health difficulties of those people suffering? What about the health difficulties? That all adds a cost onto the State as well. However, the State is going to privatise the health services anyway so that will not be important for the Government either so it is working out okay.  The problem is that the Government does not recognise that there is a problem. That is just the way it is. That would be fair enough if it even had the decency to come out and say that, and that there is not a problem. At least then it would be standing up for its own policies and how it looks at things and how it sees they can be done but the Government does not even have the courage to do that. It does not have the courage to stand over its own policies. It feigns caring all the time but we know that it does not because if it did care, then it could actually change it and do it very quickly and it would make a huge difference.  This only reflects the number that meet the incredibly low social housing income level thresholds. It does not reflect the thousands more that are desperately searching for somewhere to live in the county, or the thousands more that will be looking in the near future as houses with defective blocks continue to crumble in Donegal and around the country as the issue comes home to roost. Again, the Government policy was to facilitate developers and builders and to sacrifice citizens and that is what it did. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. The Government is saying that the lack of regulation was a lot cheaper but in fact it was not because we are paying for it now, that is for sure.  There is no doubt that the current housing targets of the Government are far too low. Donegal County Council is planning to deliver just 1,300 housing units by 2026, half of the current demand and we know this will only continue to rise. The CSO says that property prices nationally have increased 130% since early 2013, yet the Minister fails to do anything to help those looking to buy and rent in this country. It is time something is done and this is why I am supporting this motion. Unfortunately, it is time for the Government to move off. That is the only thing that will start a change to the process and a change that would allow people to have houses and to get houses.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	325	The housing situation is a crisis for everyone in the country. More and more people are feeling it. It is just getting worse. Doctors and nurses cannot find homes. Some 70% of young people are considering having to leave the country. High rents and mortgages are affecting families all over the country and we have over 11,500 people in emergency accommodation. That is the highest figure ever recorded. The number of people in emergency accommodation is an absolute scandal. How can the Government say that Housing for All is working when those figures have gone up, especially when we had an eviction ban in that time? Lack of housing is first and foremost a class issue. It always affects the people in society with the least and who are the most vulnerable. Working class people and communities feel it first and feel it worst. This is while the Government gives away billions of euro in HAP payments to private landlords and sells our public land for a few meagre social housing units in return.  I listened to Deputy Bacik criticising €1 billion being used for HAP but I have to point out to the Labour Party that it was one of its own Ministers, Jan O’Sullivan, who introduced the HAP payment in the first place. The only impediment to fixing this crisis is the lack of political will. The Government parties cling to their failed idea that the market will provide affordable housing and it refuses to stand up to elites who have made billions of euro from ordinary people struggling to keep a roof over their heads.  When this country was broke between the 1930s and the 1960s, we built thousands of houses. These houses were built by workers for workers. We had the political will then and we need that political will now. I do not believe that the Government will do it. It needs to allow the people to go to the polls and to vote for those who they think will do it.  There is an immediate need for a referendum to create a constitutional right to suitable and affordable homes for all according to their needs to ensure that we never get into this situation again. The State should immediately start building homes which should be a mixture of traditional social housing, public housing and affordable cost rental units and affordable housing. Public housing has been successful all over Europe for the last 100 years from following three things: quality; affordability; and fixity of tenure. We need that here. The social housing threshold should be raised to €50,000 for a single person and at least €75,000 for a couple. It should cost no more than 15% of income. That would allow ordinary workers to access public housing. To facilitate the building of new public housing, the Land Development Agency, LDA, should be expanded and tasked with beginning the construction of public housing on all appropriate land owned by the State or semi-State bodies. It should be given increased powers to use compulsory purchase orders on derelict and vacant buildings. Approved housing bodies should be nationalised and incorporated into the LDA. Furthermore, we need to create a new national housing agency that is publicly funded to build on public land employing unionised workers and apprentices. People renting privately need to have their rights strengthened. We need better security of tenure. There should be new legislation to ensure that tenants are not affected by the sale of a property, such as with commercial properties.  The eviction ban needs to be extended to permanently ban economic evictions into homelessness. Over the last two or three weeks, we have seen a steady increase of people contacting the office with notices to quit. We have noticed in particular, that landlords are now using the Part 8 to the six-year time to tell people that they are letting them go and taking back the accommodation. One person told us they had been given a notice to quit under Part 8. The agency told them that it had another apartment available to them if they wished. This person's rent is €1,240 at the moment.The apartment they are offering them would be €2,240. It is a convenient way to get people out of the low-rent aspect that they have. We know they cannot legally do that because a landlord or agency has to offer a person the same rent as the person who had left that premises. We are also seeing an increase in men coming into the office. One guy came in on Friday in a terrible state. He had been couch surfing and had worked abroad over the years. He is a carpenter. He had a deposit for rent and has been on daft.ie for weeks trying to get rented accommodation. In the end, he used his deposit and down payment to buy a car to sleep in. That is the Ireland we are living in. That is a genuine case. That young man had been on the housing list, as he thought, for 25 years but we explained to him that would not be the case now. He was taken off the housing list in 2008. We are trying to get him back onto it again so he can get homeless HAP. If he gets it, what is it worth to him? He cannot get rented accommodation anywhere. People are trying to grasp some sort of hope they will get somewhere along the line and the Government is standing over it. It has been part of the process over the past 20 or 30 years. Just before the eviction ban, everybody saw in their constituency offices an increase in young families, including people with children with autism, getting eviction notices. The eviction ban put that pending eviction off for about three or four months. They will all come back into an eviction situation if the Government does not extend the eviction ban. Imagine what it will be like then. Just before the eviction ban, we were told Dublin City Council and the homeless section had nowhere to put people. The only place they could go was overcrowded, if they had a family to go to, or the streets or a car. That is the reality in Ireland because of Government policies. The only impediment to making these changes is the lack of political will. That will existed in the 1930s and the 1960s, when this country was broke. We are now one of the richest countries in the world yet supposedly cannot provide homes for people who need them. We can afford it. Build the houses. I support the motion but have serious reservations about the Labour Party. It was in power between 2011 and 2016. The then Minister, Willie Penrose, announced the transformation of housing policy on 17 June 2011. That was some transformation of housing policy. The Labour Party had a Minister who brought in HAP and presided over a situation where practically no houses were being built at that time. That is why I have reservations but I will support the motion, particularly because the Government has tabled an amendment to it.

Many constructive points were made. I may not agree with them all but they had merit. Before I go through the script, I will deal with a number of points raised. Deputy Bacik and Labour referred to HAP. “Tenant in situ” is a term used by Dublin City Council. In layman’s terms, it is for an acquisition of a property where there is a notice of termination to quit. The local authorities have been given deferred sanction. They have flexibility to make decisions on the purchase of houses where people have been served with an eviction notice and are about to be made homeless without being offered a place to live. I have checked. Circulars have issued. I will follow up on it again. Deputy Howlin spoke about CPOs of vacant homes. In Housing for All and under the action plan, there is a determination to have 2,500 houses processed by way of CPO by the local authorities to provide them on the open market for resale. That issue is getting further clarification in the new planning Bill that is going through. It is something I feel strongly about. There will be vacant home officers in all local authorities and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, gave a commitment to people that if local authorities have a business case for additional vacant home officers, they should make the case to the Department if a particular town requires it. We want to bring these vacant homes back into action. Under the Croí Cónaithe scheme, for towns and villages alone we are looking at 2,000 houses coming back in. That is a €30,000 grant, and a €50,000 maximum grant if the house has been derelict. Something that may have been missed is that the fair deal scheme has been changed. People often speak about that scheme and say many houses out there are not being used for rental purposes. The disregard is now 60% of rental income rather than 20%. We hope that will bring 1,200 properties back. The short-term letting scheme Bill is coming in through the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. We hope that will bring 12,000 houses back into use for families and single people to live in. That is something that can be worked on. I join Deputy Ó Ríordáin in sympathy on the passing of Niamh Bhreathnach. She brought phenomenal change in the area of education when she was Minister. Deputy Boyd Barrett is gone. I do not know the detail of the case of Jackie and her family but people will be aware. I did not know when the tenancy was to be terminated. If it was to be terminated between the end of October of last year and 31 March this year, they cannot be evicted. I do not know the circumstances. I ask the Deputy to bring it to us so we can follow up on it. Deputy Canney stated it is about supply and I accept that point. However, we have a plan. The plan is Housing for All and in the past year we have delivered nearly 30,000 homes. People can say it is not enough. We want more homes but it is a serious start. Many Opposition parties go on about new social housing builds. We expect new social housing builds in 2022, when the figures are finalised, will be the highest in the last half-century. That is something many parties have made a point about. Deputy Canney also referred to coming off HAP and maybe it is something he will take up. I have tenants on HAP. I pursued the local authority to get them social housing. They are not differentiated, from my perspective, at a local level. I would like to follow up on it with the Deputy. He has been a champion of looking at ways to streamline our system in terms of public procurement and I accept that. The simplest way to build houses is to look at the current permissions that are there. There are over 70,000 houses. I do not say all of them can be built on, but we have to look. They are the ones that can be fast-tracked. With the best will in the world, for a private developer starting out on a greenfield site who has to get planning, it will take a hell of a lot longer than if that developer has an existing permission which can be activated. That is a space we in government are looking to go into. I do not accept that we lack empathy, to which Deputy Pringle made reference. We recognise the problem. That is why we have a Housing for All plan and are bringing in various measures. The record needs to be put straight. We are bringing in a range of proposals. Deputy Verona Murphy said one size does not fit all. We are looking at the densities and taking on those points. I feel strongly that one size does not fit all.The Planning and Development Act is coming through. We will look at densities. We will also look at what works and what will be built. We need apartments, but we need a range in that regard. I will go through the issues. In the context of the vacant homes action plan, we are seeking to bring vacant residential and commercial properties back into use. The Labour Party made reference to isolating the number of properties that are vacant. We are engaged in a data collection project, which is something I will pursue with local authorities. We need action on the ground in order to compile a list of all of properties to see how we can use them. We have allocated €150 million from the urban regeneration and development fund specifically to bring vacant houses and units back into use. It is not about the public realm, although it was previously. This money is specifically for that purpose. I encourage Deputies to talk to their local authorities. This is about local authorities coming forward with plans. This will be based on their range of population. It is about all the local authorities getting there. That should be acknowledged as well. People will talk about the 7,500 first-time buyer mortgages drawn-down in quarter 4 of 2022, which was 12.9% increase on quarter 3. We accept that landlords are leaving the market. In many cases, the properties they are selling are being bought by first-time buyers. The question for us is about how we deal with that. The cost-rental scheme is one I feel very strongly about. The rents relating to it are below 25%. Deputy Boyd Barrett made reference to Jackie and her family. The example he gave would certainly fit in with that perspective. With the demands on tradesmen and everything else, in to double output overnight, we must be realistic and do it in a way which ensures that we have the manpower. We have gone to 30,000 this year. We are seeking to increase that figure over that for last year, and we will do so. Deputy Nash made reference to the CSO figures. Once again, we are doing the work. We have to operate on final figures. That will be done pretty shortly because the figures will be finalised soon. We have seen in a positive way that in quarter 3 of last year, there were 171,000 people in the labour workforce in construction. That was a 75% increase on last year's figure of 25,000. The numbers are going up. We are ratcheting up the limit. The Labour Party's motion makes reference to the Acquisition of Development Land (Assessment of Compensation) Bill 2021. We ask Deputies to look at the Bill we are bringing forward in respect of land value sharing proposals. Ours is basically a plan-led system. Looking at what the Labour Party is bringing forward, we are of the view that it will be very much centred around a transaction. The State would look at the uplift in the value. We ask Deputies to look at the details of the forthcoming legislation to which I refer. Deputy Bacik referred to the RTB, which is a matter I followed up on. People can claim the tax credit without including the RTB number. That is a matter on which we are following up with the RTB and Department of Finance in the context of the scheme. We are putting rental inspectors into local authorities at a cost of €10 million. No one has a monopoly on wisdom on housing. We all have to work together to find the best solution. We have a plan that is working. I look forward to further debate of this matter.

That is true, which is why we wanted the provisions in our motion to be accepted and worked on by the Government, in conjunction with us, instead of a countermotion being presented. The latter, quite frankly, has angered many Deputies in opposition. Before I go on, I thank everyone for contributing to the debate on our motion, both those who agree with it and those who do not, which is fair enough. I will pick up on one point made by Deputy Joan Collins regarding HAP. The Deputy agrees with and supports our motion, but she could not help but throw a couple of digs at the Labour Party. I imagine that there is diminishing currency in that regard, although there may be currency nonetheless. She mentioned how we brought in HAP. We never brought HAP in to be a permanent housing solution. It must be remembered that HAP was brought in to replace rent supplement, which was the biggest poverty trap this country has ever known. If people were using rent supplement as the primary means of paying their rent, they could not work and it kept them in poverty for years. HAP was brought in to bring it over to the local authorities. We were actually starting to build local authority houses as well towards the end of 2015 and 2016, with a large number of Part 8 developments and Part V requirements. That stopped after 2016. One thing happened this week which, on the face of it, may not seem important in terms of the housing crisis. However, symbolically, it is really important to the people who are still sleeping in the boxrooms in which they grew up or on their parents and friends' couches. I refer to the return of Bertie Ahern to Fianna Fáil. This event has been heralded and trumpeted by Fianna Fáil. I know Fianna Fáil is not the Minister of State's party or, indeed, the party of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. It is the party of the senior Minister, however, who is not here tonight for this important debate. I do not know where he is. Maybe he is making the sandwiches or doing the teas and coffees at the cumann in Drumcondra to welcome Bertie back. I do not know but he is not here where he should be on this debate. I was contacted by a woman earlier who stated that she is disgusted that Bertie Ahern is, in her eyes, back in politics. She believes he is the reason that she will never be able to afford a house. That woman has joined the dots in respect of what has got us to where we are now. I refer here to a three-term Government that took a system that was moving in the right direction and facilitating the building and delivery of public housing in the 1990s, hollowed out our local authorities in terms of the delivery of public housing, gave everything over to developers by means of weak Part V provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2001, engaged in deregulation and, in the context of the reduction in standards, accelerated the work done by Fianna Fáil in the late 1980s. The latter has given rise to consequences relating to pyrite, mica, poor building and fire safety standards and all the crimes that were committed under that Government in the era of the Celtic tiger. Fianna Fáil believes that the return of Bertie Ahern as a great peacemaker into the party is going to remind people of that or give them a warm glow when they remember the 1990s and early noughties. The opposite is happening. People are absolutely furious. Mr. Ahern's return reminds them of why we are where we are. It reminds them why workers are unable to afford to live, be they renting or buying, and why core front-line workers in our health and transportation services, such as bus drivers, are unable to afford to live, not just in our major cities but anywhere in our country. That is why we need the eviction ban needs not only to be extended but also strengthened. Even though it has been brought in, we are still seeing homeless figures go up. The current figure is 11,500. Bertie Ahern is returning to Fianna Fáil at a time of record figures for homelessness. It is incredible. Fianna Fáil cannot resist that. The eviction ban must remain in place. The tenant in situ scheme we are discussing, which has to be accelerated and used, is not actually a good scheme; it is a necessary scheme. It is an admission of the failure of housing policy. There should be a supply of social and affordable public housing in order that people can transition from rental accommodation into that. Some people in rental accommodation do not want to be council tenants. They want to purchase their own homes through an affordable scheme. The tenant in situ scheme is the biggest admission of housing catastrophe in this country that there has ever been. Unfortunately, that is the situation we are in. The only way we can successfully keep people out of homelessness is by purchasing the houses. While we are talking about purchasing and the absolute squandering of public money, there was article in the Sunday Times by Ms Sharon McGowan last week. The article came about on foot of a freedom of information request that was submitted by the Workers' Party to Dublin City Council. It states that €221 million has been spent by Dublin City Council to buy back properties that were built by the State. We are paying twice for these properties. We paid to build them, we sold them off and now we are buying them back.That goes down as new stock. That is not new stock; it is recycled stock. This is stock we had years ago and sold away. We must stop that. Any thoughts of tenant purchase has to stop. This recycling of existing stock and the squandering of money over the course of many decades is an absolute and complete madness. It is a huge amount of money. We are talking now about housing for migrants in Ireland. It is much-needed housing that we are unable to deliver as a State. Even given the state of our resources and our riches, we are unable to deliver this at the moment. If you talk to the migrants who are here and have been here for years and talk about the housing they are living in, it is overcrowded. If you talk to the people who are cleaning our buildings and who are contract cleaners or talk to the people who are delivering our food or who work in our coffee shops and service industries and ask them, as I have, the circumstances of where they live, they are living in overcrowded places and paying rent for poor standards of accommodation. We have seen it. We have had the exposés on various TV programmes. This is how we are failing not only the migrants who are arriving now but also the future workers of this country who we need to provide the many skills and professions they bring here. We need to make sure we can deliver the housing so these people are able to start working and contributing in the many skills shortages we have. With regard to the people who are living here now, including migrants, who are living in poor conditions, we do not have enough housing inspections. I have been on to my local authority about a particular property that has more than 30 migrants living in it with absolutely disgraceful conditions. That is just one case I am dealing with this week. Anybody who is working on the front line dealing with housing cases will know we have no housing inspections. The housing inspections must be done through the local authority, and the local authorities are still under-resourced to inspect their own properties. We therefore have the private properties in deplorable conditions getting away with absolute murder. We talk of a plan for tradespeople in this country to have enough workers to be able to build the houses we need. To stop this boom and bust cycle, we need to continue to build houses, no matter who is in government and no matter what the economic situation in the State. We need to build, continue building, and build some more, and continue to drive down the cost for citizens in paying rent or being able to afford housing. We need to continue to do that. We feel a million miles away from that. This motion does not capture the Labour Party's housing policy. This motion is an emergency housing motion for the emergency we are in right now. We constructed the motion in such a way that we believed or hoped that something would be taken on board and that the Government would at least give some kind of sense that it wants to work with Opposition parties. We have seen here that the majority of the Opposition supports this, while we may disagree on the finer points of details. The thrust of what we offer in this motion is what we believe can be delivered soon, which will give a roof over people's heads and give the State time to build houses. The Government will not and we will go for a vote on this next week, which I believe is incredible. The people who are contacting Deputies Bacik and Nash, me, and all my colleagues in the House about housing are going to remain in insecure and highly expensive housing. Many of these people have notices to quit hanging over their heads and they are counting down the days for the eviction ban to expire. I have made a Hail Mary pass at our local authority that perhaps a tenant in situ rescue can help to keep them in their homes. As Deputy Nash has said, we are finding an inconsistency of approach in an emergency scheme that is needed to be run at full throttle to keep people in their homes. I will leave it at that.

An rud atá á lorg agamsa inniu ná cinneadh ón Rialtas go mbeadh ainm an réabhlóidí, Dr. Kathleen Lynn, ar ospidéal na leanaí nua atá le hoscailt an bhliain seo chugainn. Dhéanfadh sé sin aitheantas dá obair mar dhochtúir agus mar cheannródaí mná, leanaí agus cearta. Bean chróga ab ea í ó Chontae Mhaigh Eo. My proposal, since I first wrote to the then Minister for Health, former Deputy James Reilly in 2013, and the three Ministers for Health since then, is that the State would give due recognition to this daughter of Mullafarry, near Killala in County Mayo, given her contribution to Ireland in many fields, including pioneering in the male-dominated medical field in the late 1890s up to her death in 1955. Dr. Lynn had received her medical degree at the age of 25 and she continued caring for patients until she was in her 80s. Dr. Lynn died at the age of 81 and was buried at Deansgrange Cemetery in 1955. Dr. Lynn worked in Dublin's Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and was a GP in Rathmines before she and a number of other female medics set up Teach Naomh Ultáin, St. Ultan's Hospital, which was a paediatric hospital that cared for those in crying need in this city at the time, and throughout the country. That was in 1919. Given that we are coming to the end of the decade of centenaries, and given the site of the new children's hospital being built at the South Dublin Union at St. James' Hospital, it is appropriate to name the hospital after the only female commandant in charge of a republican garrison during the Rising. Dr. Kathleen Lynn had joined the Irish Citizens' Army on its founding in 1913, along with many other women. They helped out also during the Lock-out. Dr. Lynn was the Irish Citizens' Army's surgeon general and she took over the role of commandant in the City Hall outpost when Sean Connolly was shot dead on that roof very early in the republicans' occupation of City Hall. Dr. Lynn was arrested, held in Richmond Barracks and then sent to England. Dr. Lynn held firm and, in 1917, was on the reorganised Sinn Féin Ard Comhairle and was active during the War of Independence and the Civil War. Dr. Lynn was elected a Teachta Dála in 1923 for Dublin County and was a councillor for ten years, being one of the very early female Deputies. In recent weeks Dr. Lynn has been acknowledged at the bottom of the main staircase in Leinster House in a fabulous portrait, among many other views of women. I encourage people to look at that. Dr. Lynn's hospital became famous for pioneering the care of children, especially towards the end of the Spanish flu epidemic and the roll-out of the BCG vaccine that helped to eradicate TB in Ireland. Given the past few years, naming the hospital after a female medic would also honour female medics of today and their role, along with the rest of the medical staff and teams in our hospitals today, in tackling the Covid pandemic. A Church of Ireland woman, Dr. Lynn's hospital was never allowed to prosper in the State and was sidelined until its closure in the 1980s. There was a proposal in 1935 that the hospital would be amalgamated with the State's national children's hospital, but this was opposed by the then Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Edward Byrne, who said that an amalgamation would undermine the faith of Catholic children and that it would not be safe. He said there would be a widespread attack on children's morals through the medium of medicine. Given the ongoing debate on the role of the Catholic church in institutional sex abuse then and after, this charge rings very hollow.This would perhaps be another appropriate reason to name the hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.

By raising this matter, the Deputy gave me the opportunity and impetus to spend more time reading about Dr. Kathleen Lynn. I am glad I had that opportunity to learn more about this extraordinary woman who was a suffragette, a woman of Mayo, after my own heart, a professional woman, a woman Deputy, and a paediatric medic. There is nothing not to like and I have been encouraged to learn more about her. The new children's hospital, which I had the good fortune to have the opportunity to visit when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, is a key enabler of a major strategic reform of healthcare services for children and young people, informed by A New National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare in Ireland. As the Deputy knows, it will bring together the three children's hospitals into one, consolidating expertise and research excellence to ensure the best outcomes for the children of Ireland. When I visited the hospital, I was very much struck by the totally different approach that parents and children will experience when they are there. The in-room care that can be provided by parents for their children in a safe and comfortable way is in contrast to the experience so many parents have in children’s hospitals around Ireland. People do not realise that when parents have a child in hospital they have to be there the entire time. Until people go through that, they do not really understand it. The level of care parents provide to their children in hospitals is extraordinary. The Government has taken more and more steps to provide support to parents who should be aware that additional needs payments are available to them for all of the extra costs incurred when a parent is with a child in a hospital, ranging from parking and food to the additional childcare and accommodation costs that can arise. Sometimes we do not recognise that. As the Deputy is aware, the new children's hospital will be supported by two satellite centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals. These are major milestones in the wider reform effort. In 2022, for example, more than 22,000 children presented to Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and more than 92% were discharged home after their visit, keeping them away from the more acute hospitals. There have also been over 15,000 outpatient attendances at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown. Over 36,000 children presented to the emergency care unit at Tallaght in 2022, with over 4,000 outpatient attendances. Both of the satellite centres provide a new model of ambulatory care, fully aligned with Sláintecare, ensuring the right care is available in the right place at the right time in an effort to keep care away from the acute hospitals. The physical building is progressing at pace on the new children's hospital site. I am told by the Department of Health that as the physical building progresses, that there is an emerging need for a permanent name to be assigned to the hospital. I apologise to the Deputy that I do not have a better answer for him than this but I will convey to him what I have been told. In light of this need, the process for naming the new children’s hospital is under consideration. I rang Department officials to try to get a better and more thorough answer for the Deputy in respect of timing, process and other matters. I did not get an answer, however, for which I am sorry. I am also embarrassed by the quality of answer I have for the Deputy. I hope the Department of Health will follow up with the Deputy directly to outline what the process will be and at what pace it will proceed. Nevertheless and notwithstanding that omission, the delivery of the new hospital is a crucial milestone for parents with children with long-term and ongoing care and medical needs. It is a positive step forward to see the satellite centres working in advance of that.

It is important that Ministers stand up once and for all and assert themselves. I have received the same answer for the five years since Children’s Health Ireland was set up. This is its role and it involves State and the public money. The campaign to have the national children's hospital named after Dr. Kathleen Lynn is not a party political one - Dr. Maurice Manning and Dr. Martin Mansergh have supported it, as have many other historians - and it not being pursued only on the basis of history. Dr. Lynn's legacy is bigger than the role she played on major historical occasions. As we approach the end of the decade of centenaries, this being the final year, it would be appropriate for the process to be concluded quickly and the hospital named, even if that means the Minister or somebody else issuing guidance to Children’s Health Ireland. In addition, as the Minister of State said, we have a fabulous building, which I too have visited. Hopefully, it will do exactly what has been promised and the hospital will learn from the teachings of Dr. Kathleen Lynn and other revolutionary doctors, such as Dr. Dorothy Stopford Price, Dr. Madeleine ffrench-Mullen, and all the other medical staff. The first hospital was run by women from start to finish and they set the bar very high for every other paediatric hospital. I firmly believe that on that basis alone, this is an opportunity for us to reflect what was happening in Teach Naomh Ultan at 37 Charlemont Street way back then when the hospital was set up. We seemed to lose our way for a while but at least now there is the potential to have this new hospital. It is opening next year but will, I hope, be handed over very early in the new year and patients will see the benefit of it. Perhaps they would also see the benefit if it was named after Kathleen Lynn.

That would be wonderful. We have so many things named after men in every walk of life. I do not pretend to be qualified enough or to know enough to be able to assess Dr. Lynn's position in this relative to the other medics who might be in contention. When the hospital is opened I would love to see it named after a strong woman. It seems to me, however, that when the Deputy asks a question regarding the process he should be given an answer on whether it has started, if there are plans to start it and when that will be. There is a campaign on this and the very least the State should do is to provide an answer, even if that means saying this is not being done yet but will be done on 1 March, or whenever. That would at least provide some clarity and an answer. The answer I was given for reply to the Deputy in the House was not adequate. The least people can do is provide clarity.

I also thank the Minister of State for attending. While she is not a Minister in the Department of Transport, it is great she is here. I have raised a number of times the need to upgrade the N25 between Carrigtwohill and Midleton, County Cork, and will continue to do so. The House just debated housing. The good news is that there are plans to build over 2,500 housing units just outside Midleton. The process is well under way and planning applications have been made, or are in the process of being made, for some of them. Some of the developers are going ahead and it is looking good. However, I have looked through the traffic and transportation assessments made in respect of three projects and which the council has also done. They all state that the N25 road needs upgrading. One assessment states, for example, that the existing junctions will be operating above capacity and will require upgrading. An analysis shows that the junction can accommodate the proposed phase 1 but, after that, it will be at its limit and further development would be reliant on a Cork County Council infrastructure upgrade. Another assessment states the interchange would be unable to accommodate future planned population growth unless road infrastructure improvements are implemented, and so on. Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has stated that the proposed development shall be undertaken strictly in accordance with the recommendations of the transport assessment. The transport assessment states the road need upgrading. My concern is that this housing development could be put at risk unless the road is upgraded. There were plans afoot for, and €1.3 million was spent on, the Midleton to Carrigtwohill road scheme. The first public consultation was held in October 2020 and the option selection process went ahead after that. The public consultation presented feasible options for developing the scheme within the defined study area. That was on display from July 2021 to September 2021. However, the plug was pulled on the entire project in December 2021. I have been raising this matter consistently. I have just come from a select committee meeting with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, at which we spoke about an unbelievable IDA Ireland-owned site beside the N25. It is fully service and has been idle for the past 15 years. It covers 133 acres, with water and sewage services provided at great expense to the taxpayer all those years ago, but cannot be used because the road infrastructure is not adequate. IDA Ireland tells us the reason the site is not used is that the road is inadequate. The agency has people looking for sites like this one but they cannot locate at this site for that reason. The Minister indicated that if a developer or project were to appear on the horizon, the State would move in and do the road.Much work has already been done on this road and a lot of money has been spent. Why stop it now? Why not just continue? Even with the best will in the world, it will take a number of years before we see shovels in the ground because land has to undergo compulsory purchase orders and people have to apply for planning permissions and all kinds of other things. The plug was pulled halfway through. The other major issue that concerns me is that this road is extremely busy. There are 30,000 vehicle movements a day on it that move very quickly. I have written to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. It agrees with me that there are serious safety worries regarding this road and it talked about addressing them. If it is to do so, it will cost an awful lot of money to make the road safe. The answer is to proceed with the original plan, build the other road that was proposed, take away my concerns with respect to the housing development, open up the IDA site, which will have investment, and make the road safe. I raised this matter with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, and he did not disagree with me. He was there when Amgen came to Ireland and planned to build a major factory employing 1,100 people a long time ago. I want to hear what the Minister of State says regarding this matter.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	335	I thank the Deputy. This is an issue he has raised many times. I am glad to speak to him about it. When we consider that part of the country, there is a capacity for development, as the Deputy said, and not only because of the IDA site. There is a strategic opportunity for that part of the country having regard to offshore wind, for example, and the transport of turbines from Rosslare Port and other ports along the south coast to the south west, where our most extraordinary strategic advantage as an island nation happens to be. To develop wind energy would secure our energy sustainability, allow us to export energy and deliver 12-month-per-year jobs right up the western seaboard, with technicians and others working there to support offshore wind activity. Not only is a project like this entirely in line with Project Ireland 2040, it also supports the development of an IDA-owned site at a time when we are constantly looking for further development. It is also part of the strategic development of the State's physical infrastructure into the next two decades and how we provide for our economic, energy and employment sustainability throughout the south west. There are so many other benefits to this proposed project. It would connect Cork and Rosslare much better and directly benefit the towns of Carrigtwohill and Midleton, which the Deputy is much more familiar with than me. The improvement to the network would enable more reliable journey times, still support, as I said, the strategic development of the south-west region and facilitate economic and commercial growth. The proposed project includes the possibility of developing the existing route for the benefit of local residents through the provision of new cycling and walking facilities, which clearly would promote physical activity in the area. By removing traffic from the existing route, road users would benefit from reduced journey times, certainty and improved road safety, as the Deputy outlined. It would also offer better connections for active travel and public transport. As the Deputy is aware, due to the fact that the greater portion of national development plan, NDP, funding becomes available in the second half of the decade, there is a constraint on the funding available for new projects this year. Most national road projects in the NDP were progressed in 2022 but projects such as the N25, which did not have the required funding to progress in 2022, remain part of the NDP and will be considered for funding in subsequent years. Allocations for projects in 2023 are in the process of being finalised and will be announced in the near future. On the current status of the N25 Carrigtwohill to Midleton road, as the Deputy is aware, technical advisors have completed their assessments of the route options and determined a preferred solution. Improvements to crossings over this very busy section of the N25 to enhance active travel, I am told, are being considered as part of the scheme. The Deputy referenced some of those safety improvements. TII was unable to provide an allocation for that project in 2022, given the level of funding available for major roads projects. As a result, progression of the project to design and development of the business case for decision gate 1 under the public spending code was not possible last year. The delivery programme for the project will be kept under review and considered in terms of the overall funding envelope available to TII. I suggest that considering the overall strategic development of the south west, and the very urgent safety issues the Deputy highlighted, the project should be progressed.

I am very grateful for that. As I said, we need housing badly. I am concerned that the delay in upgrading this roadway could put many of these houses at risk. That is very important. This site is bounded by a rail link at one end and a dual carriageway on the other side. There is an airport that is not so far away at only 20 minutes, a seaport, two universities and, if the housing goes ahead, plenty of houses. It also has water and wastewater facilities from the time when Amgen was there, power, is dead level and is laid out with roads internally. It is ready to go. If the IDA manages to encourage a developer or industry to move to the site shortly, and it arrives but finds it cannot use this site - I understand this has happened a few times already - because road construction is not up to standard, will the State then move on it? Is that what it will take? It is a little like the Kerry Group headquarters that is down the road, which had to put road construction in place in order to make it happen. It is a chicken and egg situation. My argument is that we should move on this. Work has already gone on. There are also people living on this corridor who own land and houses. They cannot sell the land or houses because they are, in effect, frozen until a final decision is made. We also have the Celtic Interconnector, where we are linking with France. That particular cable is coming under the sea and roadway and is landing on this site. I suggested to EirGrid a while ago that it put its converter station on the site, which it is doing. The site will also have that kind of power plus a very powerful Internet connection that will go along with that. This makes the site extraordinarily attractive but it has been sitting there for 15 years. As I said, housing is at risk and the road is not safe. It is very dangerous. I call on the TII, if it is listening, to get its act together and put some interim works in place, as it promised me it would a year ago, to make that road safer. My worry is there will be a pile-up someday and there will be loss of life.

I work with the IDA in my role as the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services. I have a very strong interest in making sure sites are available and ready throughout the island. The Ireland for finance strategy has a very strong regional focus and it is very important to me that suitable sites are available. It would be a matter of embarrassment to bring somebody to a green field with no road. I certainly hope that will not persist and that TII is listening, even on a Thursday evening, to a debate in the House to hear the case the Deputy had repeatedly made for the development of this road. Again, if we are to be strategic about the development of this island, concentrating on facilities, planning, the grid infrastructure network the Deputy described, the interconnector network, the roads network and the planning for ports in respect of the development of offshore wind in the Atlantic, the opportunity that gives us in sustainability and jobs into the future is quite extraordinary. Every single part of the State needs to be alive and awake to that, and to make plans for it. It seems to me TII is as responsible as any other entity in regard to its own planning. It would appear from the advocacy the Deputy made regarding the road, that this project fits in in every possible way. I certainly hope it progresses.

Such a road is built on peat, is raised, and has the unfortunate habit of deteriorating very quickly in a short space of time. This road is in a very historic area. It runs from the location where I hold my clinic, which we politicians have to do on a regular basis, from the historic location at Ballagh in Donadea. It is now Connolly's pub; it used to be Taaffe's. The road goes westward from there, past another historic place, Roche's pub. I do not spend my time travelling to all the pubs but the road passes them. It goes past Roche's pub and continues for another three or four miles almost to Timahoe. The problem is that the road is now in a dangerous condition. This is not due to potholes. There are no potholes and the surface is smooth but every foot or yard there is a massive depression where the road has subsided. Anyone travelling more than 30 mph is in danger of overturning their car. The road is in a dangerous condition.These obstacles are to be found every yard. If you get five yards without such an obstruction, you are very lucky, so the road is dangerous and is getting worse. The reason it has got so bad so quickly is that it delivers a lot of heavy traffic, there has been a lot of investment in the immediate area, which is in the middle of the countryside, and a lot of jobs arising from that. There is a lot of transport traffic necessitated by the location of those jobs in the area. The important thing, however, is that we register the message in whatever quarter is relevant of the need to do something about this to address the condition of the road in the next fortnight or three weeks at the latest because something will happen. There will be an accident and it can be averted if we deal with it now.

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the Roads Act 1993, as amended. Works on those roads are funded from councils' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. I am told that the maintenance of the rampart road from Ballagh to Timahoe in County Kildare is, therefore, the direct responsibility of Kildare County Council. The Department of Transport says that it provides grant funding to assist local authorities in carrying out their functions as the statutory road authorities. Within the available budget, the Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated, the Department says, on as fair and as equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. Grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility, with some account taken of traffic. As the Deputy says, the matter of the construction and improvement of road on peatlands has always been a very challenging task in geotechnical engineering. Rampart roads, which are generally narrow raised roads without verges, can be constructed over peat, but particular difficulties, as the Deputy said, arise with roads over peat because peat provides such a poor foundation for road pavement as it is frequently weak and highly compressible compared with more normal subsurfaces, such as boulder clay. Because of that, it is very hard to maintain a high level of serviceability on such roads. Councils have approached the Department from time to time asking whether the cost and difficulty of maintaining roads over peat could be taken into account in the grant allocation process. The Department's position on that is that grant allocations based primarily on the length of network in a particular local authority are seen as the most equitable approach. If other criteria such as road condition, for example, were used as a basis for grants, then, the Department says, that could have the effect of rewarding councils that do not prioritise roads maintenance when allocating their own resources. As part of its policy development role, the Department has initiated a review of existing guidance on the management of roads over peat with a view to assessing performance of different methodologies to provide updated guidance. I am not exactly sure what that last bit means - forgive me - but I think the Department is cognisant of the particular difficulty with peat.

That is what I am trying to do - to provide that guidance. Suffice it to say that the condition of the road as it stands is sufficiently serious for the local authority - or whoever else wishes to take responsibility - to take some action of a nature that will render the road compliant with health and safety regulations. That is a requirement regardless of who does it. I raise this matter on the basis, first of all, of unusually heavy traffic, which has been established, and that the road, to be fair, on both ends is in good condition, even though part of that is rampart road as well. The local authorities long ago achieved a measure of dealing with rampart roads by reinforcing the tarmac, steel, mesh reinforcing or whatever the case may be, so it works very well. The local authority is very familiar with this. It can do it. I ask at this stage that whoever can do it, whoever has to put their finger on the button to start it, start now, if possible, because we cannot wait for an accident. We cannot wait and know that a road is substandard and does not comply with health and safety regulations. If we did not know about it, it would not be too bad, but I travelled across it the other evening and it was appalling. I know I have a bad back, but it is not that bad. It was nearly broken when I got to the end of the road. I thank the Minister of State for the reply and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing the debate to take place. I ask that whoever wishes to take responsibility for this do it now before it is too late.

However, the Department also says that it will advise the council of the Deputy's concerns about the condition of this road, though I suspect that the Deputy has managed to bring those concerns to Kildare County Council by his own good office. As for the question of managing roads over peat, I did not give the Deputy this additional detail. The Department established recently a working group which includes representatives from local authorities with experience of managing roads over peat to review the existing guidance and to update the recommended approach to rehabilitation, recognising how much more difficult it is and taking into account any new or innovative maintenance methods. However, I think the Department is well aware of the Deputy's concerns and I am sure the county council is also. That is the statutory authority at present.

While there is a diverse community in Dublin 2 and 8, the Government continues to increase the number of people in the inner city without increasing facilities and services.  The Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, campus on Aungier Street represents a huge opportunity to reverse the neglect by the Government.  It offers an opportunity for the State to make some small amends for decades of neglect.  The DIT building is a huge site and a huge asset for the State.  It offers a real opportunity to deliver some essential services and facilities for residents living in the Dublin 2 and 8 area.  The nearby DIT building on Kevin Street was sold off to a private developer some years ago.  It will add nothing to the local community in terms of the facilities and services that are needed for a functioning community.  This development will just add more pressure to services and facilities.  The DIT site in Aungier Street cannot just be sold off and more residents added to the community, which is already bursting at the seems.  The Government needs to ensure that additional services and facilities are put in place.  The neglect of the flats needs to stop.  One positive measure that would help that would be that the community would have a publicly accessible leisure and sports centre on the site of the DIT in Aungier Street.  That would be a great and necessary asset for a community that is at capacity, for everyone, especially a community that has been neglected for years.

On the question of the Aungier Street campus, the property is currently fully in the ownership of Technological University, TU, Dublin. Under the terms of the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005, both TU Dublin and the Grangegorman Development Agency, GDA, are together responsible for the disposal of assets, including the Aungier Street property. The funding realised by the disposal of these assets will then be reinvested in the Grangegorman campus. The property was listed for disposal on the State property register in September 2019 with no interest being indicated by the State sector in retaining the property in public ownership. On that basis, the GDA and TU Dublin have incorporated the disposal of the property into their funding plans for relocation to Grangegorman. Both the GDA and TU Dublin are mandated by the 2005 Act to obtain the best value from any property disposal so as to maximise the resources available for the Grangegorman development and to reduce the need for direct Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council recently debated the rezoning of Aungier Street as part of the preparation and approval of its development plan but the council decided to maintain the zoning as is. The west quad is the new home on the Grangegorman site for the relocated business school and is being funded through the sale of TU Dublin's property on Aungier Street. In 2020, that sale was put on hold due to market instability caused by Covid-19 and is expected to resume again in 2023. The west quad will be home to approximately 4,000 students from the TU Dublin College of Business currently in Aungier Street, and the School of Languages and Law. It will also host the university conferring hall which will have a capacity of approximately 800 people.  I appreciate that the development of Grangegorman is of strategic interest to the Deputy but also that it is on the other side of the river and outside the Deputy's immediate constituency. Deputy Andrews's responsibility is to his own area - I do not mean that in any critical way - and my responsibility is to the people of Dún Laoghaire, not of Dublin 8 either. I totally respect and understand that. In terms of the question around serviced properties and the other facilities for the area, it is important to highlight the range of education services being provided by the Department of Education. Sandymount Educate Together Secondary School was established in 2016 and will ultimately cater for 1,000 pupils. Similarly, Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School will cater for 1,000 pupils. While I know these schools are not in the immediate area to which Deputy Andrews refers, they are proximate to it. I know both of those schools well. At primary level, Harold's Cross Educate Together National School, Gaelscoil Eoin, Harcourt Terrace Educate Together National School and Shellybanks Educate Together National School are all providing additional school places in the area. I would raise one note of concern with the Deputy. It is very important that communities that are taking in people from a whole range of different places are supported, particularly through the €450 million community fund announced by the Minister for Social Protection. That money is available to communities for better facilities and I would encourage the Deputy to look at every opportunity to avail of some of that funding for his own constituency. However, I would have a concern around the language used and references to Dublin city taking in more and more asylum seekers. Everywhere is taking in more asylum seekers, right across every constituency. There have been tensions in Aungier Street, with very many good people coming out to balance and moderate that but there have also been some difficulties there. We genuinely do not want to do anything that adds to or inflames those difficulties. It is important that every community is supported. Every community is taking in people right across the country and will have to continue to do so.

The DIT campus on Aungier Street is a huge facility and is going to be redeveloped. Ultimately, it will probably be a build-to-rent building like the one at the DIT site on Kevin Street. That building will be 14 storeys high and will have a huge impact on the area. The construction is already having a huge impact on local residents on Kevin Street and Bishop Street. It is not going to add anything to the area. It is going to bring in a huge number of people. As I said, the area lacks sports facilities for local sports and football clubs. I know the Minister of State is associated with Granada Football Club, which is a fantastic club with great facilities and that is great to see. I know the club could always do with more facilities but the reality is that for those around Kevin Street there is a tiny pitch - it is hardly the size of the floor space in this room - on Digges Street. Kids training and playing for any of the local clubs, including the Iveagh Trust or the Iveagh Celtic club and Aungier Street have to travel to Crumlin to play on a full sized astro turf pitch or even to train on a decent sized astro turf or grass pitch. They have to travel quite a significant distance and it is very hard to get young children to travel such distances just to train on a Tuesday and Thursday evening. The Iveagh Celtic club and the Aungier Street club do fantastic work in the local community but they do not have the facilities. I met a group of older people yesterday who were saying that there are no facilities in the area. We do not even have a swimming pool. Lots of areas have pools and sports facilities which are so important for a functioning, healthy community but they are all lacking in the area. There is no reason sports facilities cannot be made available on the Aungier Street campus. I am not suggesting that we take over the entire DIT campus but that we develop a sports and leisure centre on the site. That is very doable and realistic but there must be a commitment and an acknowledgement that communities in the inner city have been neglected for years. We must make amends for that and that is what this Government needs to do.

I would highlight the great work done by the north-east inner-city working group which attempted to do much of what the Deputy advocates on the north side of the city. I agree that historically, the Liberties area has not had the same focus and is particularly deprived of playing facilities. I have done a lot of work with Mr. Eddie D'Arcy of the Solas Project, based in the Liberties, and am well aware of the challenges with regard to access to playing space. It is one of the most acute challenges. The Deputy is quite right to highlight Granada Football Club. It is a wonderful club with 1,300 players but it struggles for playing space. It is the single biggest challenge in many respects for clubs right across my constituency, where there is far more green space than there is in Deputy Andrews's local area. There are similar housing pressures in both constituencies but there is more green space in mine. It is so important to develop that in the inner city and to protect it where it exists in the inner city. At the same time, we have to work out the opportunities for future development. The population is going to continue to grow but we have a finite amount of space. We are not going to start building football pitches in the middle of roads so we are going to have to figure something different out. I am being imaginative here now, but would the Deputy support a range of 13- to 15-storey buildings in the inner city, each with a swimming pool available to the community and a football pitch on the roof? How are we going to reimagine space in the inner city, in a mid-size European capital city with a growing population? We have the same amount of space. We cannot turn people away, and we cannot say "No" to development and population growth. We want people to be here. We want them to work but we also want them to have a good lifestyle as well. We are going to have to look at the models in other cities, where there are much higher-density buildings but much better facilities within those buildings too. As I look around the world, in different places, I see that sort of development. I see 13- and 14-storey buildings with exceptionally good facilities which are made available to the occupants and the people living in the surrounding area. I do not see that replicated here and I wonder what the vision will be in Deputy Andrews's constituency, as much as in my constituency, for accommodating that additional growth and the services that people need.
