Subsequent to events last night and based on the line-up of Ministers in front of us, are we looking at an audition here this morning? I draw the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to a commitment the Government made on establishing a commission of inquiry to investigate Project Eagle, from which it seems to be reversing. As the Minister knows, it was reported in 2015 that Project Eagle, a loan portfolio of 850 properties across Northern Ireland, was sold for €1.6 billion by NAMA. There is considerable concern that this was not the true value of this amount of property and that the true value was not sought or delivered. The Comptroller and Auditor General has made some very damning findings in that regard. There are allegations of political involvement, both in the North and in the South, and representations that favoured one buyer over another, and these have been covered in detail by BBC's "Spotlight" programme. Cerberus, the successful buyer, actually met the Department of Finance before the sale was closed, which I would imagine was completely inappropriate. I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to comment on that. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, actually met Cerberus the day before the closure. There are reports and records of contact between the Minister for Finance and Ministers from Northern Ireland, particularly the then First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the then Minister, Mr. Sammy Wilson. It is alleged also that £7 million was involved in fixing the deal and that it was lodged in an offshore account. This is now being investigated by an assembly finance committee. There are allegations that decisions in NAMA were made without adequate notes being taken or proper management of the apparent conflicts of interest. There was a flawed sales process and an inability on the part of NAMA to show that it got the best value for money for the State. The sale involved so much money that investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice are under way. The Committee of Public Accounts is finalising a report on the sale as we speak and has been working on that for the past number of months, but the Government committed on an all-party basis to a commission of inquiry into Project Eagle some weeks ago. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has demurred from that commitment because he does not feel that there were adequate grounds for a commission. Will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, commit that the Government will establish a commission of inquiry and will he outline the timeline for its terms of reference?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for his question. I was in the House when we established NAMA. One of the aspects that we took considerable care in ensuring was that there could be no possibility of the Minister for Finance of the day interfering in NAMA's commercial activities. I was on the Opposition benches at the time and that was written into the law for good reason, namely, to ensure that NAMA was established on an independent basis and would make its own commercial decisions. That has been the at bedrock of NAMA's operations. Clearly, this means that the Minister for Finance is completely cut off from the way in which NAMA makes decisions about Cerberus, Project Eagle or any other matter in which it has dealings. It is important that the House is aware of this important separation. As to the idea of establishing a commission of investigation, I understand that the Taoiseach met the leaders of the Opposition and it was agreed in principle that such a commission would be established. As the Deputy averted to, however, we also know that the Committee of Public Accounts is undertaking a report on this issue as a follow-up to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is appropriate that we would hear the outcome of the deliberations of that committee, which is an organ of this House, before we make a decision in plenary on the terms of reference and the appropriate scope of any commission of investigation. That is the approach that is being taken and it is wholly appropriate. The results will fall where they may and the Government is fully open to such an approach.

Why did he say in the House only a few weeks ago that, in his view, there did not seem to be adequate grounds for a commission? That does not suggest to me that the Minister is "completely cut off". The question is one of whether NAMA delivered the best return possible on taxpayers' money. In the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General, our spending watchdog, it did not. The notion that the Minister could be cut off fails in that instance. In fact, taxpayers have been failed. We need answers. I welcome the commitment by the Minister, Deputy Bruton that the commission will be established. We expect the Committee of Public Accounts to publish its report within the next fortnight. On that basis, how quickly will the Government move to establish the commission?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	To make it clear, there is no question of the Minister having acted inappropriately. He met a former US Secretary of the Treasury who happened to be an employee of Cerberus. He had no hand, act or part in the decision of NAMA, which is established independently under statute to make decisions on its own. Its decisions and decision-making process are what are under scrutiny, as the Deputy rightly recognised. The Minister for Finance has not been involved in that decision-making process, either about the selection of tenderers or any of the other matters about which the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised questions. The issue that is before the Committee of Public Accounts is whether the approach taken by NAMA was adequate. The Minister for Finance has been open with the committee and participated fully in its discussions. It is clear that we have set up legislation that ensures that NAMA makes its decisions independently of any politician.That is operating. The Committee of Public Accounts, which is an independent body, has a right to scrutinise the outcome of that and if we, in this House, decide the commission of inquiry, which has been agreed in principle, ought to go ahead, we will make that decision but it is entirely to make sure there is proper public accountability for decisions made, on a delegated basis, by NAMA, which was entirely delegated to make those commercial decisions independent of the Minister for Finance or any other politician.

While the Government might have won the vote it should be very clear that it and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, do not enjoy the confidence or support of the majority of Irish people. The Taoiseach and the Government remain in power by way of favour from Fianna Fáil and the Independents in the Government. We all know why Fianna Fáil gave its continued support to this clapped-out Government. Deputy Micheál Martin and his crew are very happy for the failing coalition to remain in power, perpetuating crises and injustice in housing and health. A weak Government suits Fianna Fáil until it is ready to pull the plug based on its own narrow electoral interests. We are clear about what Fianna Fáil is at and why it keeps the Government in power. That is not in question.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	Could the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, tell me how the Government managed to secure the support of its Independent colleagues? What was the price of the votes of the Ministers, Deputies Shane Ross, John Halligan, Seán Canney, Kevin Boxer Moran and Finian McGrath, for keeping Deputy Enda Kenny, an incredibly incompetent Taoiseach, in power? We know the Independents were promised some unspecified review of Garda operations by international experts, something that already falls within the remit of the Garda Inspectorate. However, there is a suspicion that more was offered to the Independent Alliance members of the Government in terms of goodies for their constituencies. Could the Minister indicate whether that is true? Perhaps it was another cath lab for the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, in Waterford or Stepaside Garda station, for the Minister, Deputy Ross. The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny's name is writ large across the turmoil and chaos in which the Government has become embroiled in the past week. Indeed, his name is writ large across every crisis over which the Government presides. Before the general election last year the Taoiseach told the people it was a clear choice between stability and chaos. He was right, and he has delivered the chaos in spades. Through his evasion, spin and incompetence in the handling of the McCabe scandal, Deputy Enda Kenny has proven himself unfit to continue as Taoiseach. It is clear from media reports this morning that Fine Gael members do not trust Deputy Enda Kenny to run the party so how on earth do they trust him to run the Government? I have two questions for the Minister. Could he give us the details in full of the deal reached with Fine Gael's Independent supporters yesterday? Given that Deputy Enda Kenny does not command the confidence of the people, when will he vacate the office of Taoiseach?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	7	I thank Deputy Mary Lou McDonald for the question. As she is aware, the objective of the Government is set out in the programme for Government and the Independents and Fine Gael have agreed on that approach. It is all about using our steadily improving economy to improve the lives of people and it is built on a very solid set of programmes. We have a very comprehensive plan on housing, which we never had before. We also have a comprehensive plan on rural revival, which we also never had before. We are seeing every day more people getting back to work and more people returning who had to leave these shores. It is due to the policies pursued by the previous Government and continued now, with a new emphasis on fairness, by the present Government.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's party has spent its time relentlessly trying to stand in the way of the progress this Government has made. We are now seeing the fruits of that, namely, more investment in education, housing and health. In terms of what is new from the discussions yesterday, the Independents asked that an independent expert from overseas would look at the process we have put in place to improve the oversight of the Garda, and that is right.I am proud of the changes we made, which include introducing whistleblowers' legislation, an independent Policing Authority and an independent Garda Inspectorate and strengthening GSOC. It is appropriate at this point that we would look at whether that process, which has been operating for some time, meets best international practice. That is what the Independents have asked for and been provided with. That is part of an approach by this Government to make sure we have solid accountability for our gardaí and other State bodies. That is something this Government is pledged to deliver. As stones have been turned over in recent times, we have seen things we hoped were not there but that is the reality. We are getting to the bottom of those problems and dealing with them very clearly. There is no special deal with the Independents. There is a programme for Government that will improve the lives of the people of this country. Confidence was voted in that Government yesterday. There is a very full agenda that we will continue to pursue.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	The Government's record is quite eye-catching - indeed, eye watering. It includes one in eight persons on waiting lists, which is quite something, and childhoods spent in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hostels and hotels. If the Minister believes this is stuff to brag about, that is, of course, his prerogative. I would beg to differ. I asked the Minister to set out very clearly what the Government has agreed with its Independent colleagues. It is important that he does so. He seems to be suggesting that an inspection of the Garda Inspectorate is what is envisaged. I find that deeply implausible. I suggest that if the Government's Independent colleagues agreed to that, one wonders about the clarity of their thought. The Minister should remember that the inspectorate has delivered 754 recommendations, the vast majority of which have not been implemented. I also asked the Minister about the position of the Taoiseach. Listening to the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues, it is very clear that confidence in Deputy Enda Kenny as the leader of Fine Gael has run out. That is Fine Gael's business but how can the Government plausibly suggest that this man should remain as Taoiseach? I have asked a question and I think we need an answer. When will the Taoiseach step aside?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	We have a programme for Government to which we are operating. That is the arrangement and that is the truth of it. Deputy McDonald must see that we are improving the situation in health even though we have problems there. We are treating 20% more people in our health service and 2 million people will have operations this coming year as a result of the investment we are putting into that, so there are many people coming into our hospitals, getting good treatment and having their lives improved as a result of the investment we are able to make. The reason we are able to make that investment is that we worked carefully over the past couple of years to get 200,000 people back to work. We are talking about 200,000 pay packets going into homes and revenue into our Exchequer. We are able to invest in education and health. That is the only way we can improve our lot. I have heard Sinn Féin. It criticises, condemns and expresses outrage about everything but supports nothing. It has opposed every single effort by this Government and the previous one to provide improvements for our community. I quoted Teddy Roosevelt last night. He drew a distinction between the critic, who is abundant on the Opposition benches, and the doer, who gets into the arena and delivers change that has a real impact on people's lives.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	Every other issue has been buried amid the chaos of the last seven days. The Government has now survived a motion of no confidence. In whatever time it has left, it is important that the Government focuses on some of the crucial issues on which it promised clear action. A new report was published on the private rental sector this week. It showed the largest yearly increase in rents across the country since these records began in 2002. The report from property website daft.ie covered the 2016 calendar year. During that year, rents rose by an extraordinary 13.5%. As the Minister well knows, increases of this magnitude put unbearable pressure on families. They make it harder, if not impossible, for people to buy their own homes. Broken down, these figures show 14.5% increases in Dublin and 12% hikes in Cork. Even outside the so-called pressure areas, we saw rises of 12.5% in rents in Limerick and 10.7% in Waterford. My colleague and our housing spokesperson, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has called on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to consider including these in the so-called pressure zones. Of course, he has refused. The Government is basically telling people in Limerick and Waterford that it will do nothing to halt the galloping rents that they are now finding unaffordable. Even if that were the only issue, it would be strong and sufficient evidence for new action. However, another worrying aspect highlighted in the daft.ie report is that there is now a critical supply issue. The number of homes available to rent at the start of this month was just 4,000. We need a rapid increase in the availability of housing and the supply solution. In the meanwhile, is the Government willing to accept that the rental strategy it set out to this House is not fit for purpose? Is it not now clear that formal rent control, for which we have advocated for some time and for which my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, has advocated for a protracted period of time, is the only policy that will have a real impact on the galloping rent increases? Will the Minister confirm his agreement to revisit the whole issue of formal national rent control now?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	I believe the real solution to this is increased supply. That is the real focus of the approach that the Government has been taking. It is about real supply coming from social housing. For the first time, we have committed to 47,000 new builds of social housing after a period in which there was virtually no social housing constructed, which created huge imbalances in the marketplace. We also have to get private sector building going as well. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has created a whole range of initiatives to move that along using council and publicly-owned land to open up new opportunities for affordable housing, starter homes and social housing. That work is in progress. I believe it is encouraging to see in the reports that the Minister has published this week on the progress that has been made that there is a very strong growth in, for example, housing starts, which is an early indicator of the success of the strategy he is pursuing. We will have to see that materialise in completions in due course but I believe there are strong indications that we are seeing a revival of activity in the sector. The Minister has recognised that there are pressures in the rental market as a result of that lack of supply. That is why he has introduced for a period a cap on rents. That cap provides that there can be only a 4% increase in rents. It also provides that there is a restriction on those who have not had increases for a number of years. Landlords cannot leapfrog rents to increase them in big amounts. Those caps are just coming into force now. We look forward to seeing the rental figures in the future impacted by those decisions. In terms of extending that to other areas, the Minister has indicated that there is an approach to extending it. It will be based on an analysis of the actual marketplace situation in each location. The Minister is fully open to looking at new areas.As of the date he produced the order in December, Dublin and Cork clearly met that criteria but there is a further group coming up behind those cities, and I have no doubt other areas will be subjected to such caps also if that is established.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	20	The Minister's answer is not good enough. He talks about supply. Of course, supply is the answer but the reality I have just outlined is that there are only 4,000 houses available to rent this month. There is no point in the Minister talking about a year or so. We need to have a rental policy now and that rental policy has to affect every citizen. We do not want a protracted process that involves only people affected now in Dublin and Cork. As far as the Government is concerned, the people in Limerick, Waterford and other areas can take a hike. I ask Minister to reconsider that until such time as the supply becomes available, which I believe it will over time, to ensure that people will not be facing ruinous rises in their rents, wherever they live in this country. I ask him to accept the proposal to put a rent cap in place nationally until such time as the agreed strategy to increase supply becomes effective.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	The truth is that the Minister has put in place a framework for putting caps on rental accommodation.

As Deputy Howlin recognises, it is crucial that we continue to get the public supply, the rapid build, the new initiatives in the private sector and the new student accommodation that will take pressure off rental accommodation. All those elements are proceeding at pace.

The patients who have genetic emphysema are due to see their use of Repreeza provided through a compassionate use programme end in two weeks. Most of them have been on the treatment for up to a decade and fear a rapid deterioration if the drug is no longer available. An application to have the treatment, which costs more than €100,000 per patient but is provided free of charge, has been rejected by the HSE drugs group. I want to compliment the Alpha One Foundation, which runs a HSE-funded screening programme in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. It has said that the treatment has been life-changing for patients. I compliment people such as Professor McElvaney and others who have been doing great work for the patients who suffer from this most severe of diseases. I know about this disease first hand, being a very close friend of a patient who has been suffering with it for many years and who relies on this life-saving drug. Some people have another condition, panniculitis, which is combined with the emphysema problem I have highlighted. If this drug is taken from them, they will slowly fade away. This Government, the Department of Health, and the Minister, who is sitting beside the Minister, Deputy Bruton, should get on to the drugs companies providing this drug. For God's sake, we are not talking about an unimportant issue. We are talking about a drug that will save people's lives. It is saving their lives. It is keeping them alive. If the drug is taken from them, the immediate effect will be that they will lose the power in their legs, they will not be able to breath and will have to fight for every breath. The money for this drug has to be provided but the drugs companies have to be tackled also.I ask the Minister for Health in particular to go to them, sit down with them and tell them that for God's sake on compassionate grounds they should reduce the cost so the HSE will be able to continue to provide this lifesaving drug. I know people who are at home today and who have already heard Professor McElvaney and others discussing the drug on Radio 1 this morning. They will also hear it being spoken about here, but what we want to hear from the Minister and the Government is that they will help these people. It is not an huge number of people, but my God their lives are every bit as important as mine or the Minister's any day of the week.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	30	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I read the newspaper reports, as did the Deputy. Any drug that improves people's lives is something to be welcomed. I understand the patients have what is described as compassionate access to the drug but the company appears to be suggesting this will be withdrawn from them. The HSE has a process for deciding what drugs are supplied with the public paying for them. These decisions are made entirely independently of the political process. There is an independent process which I understand is not complete, and whether the drug in question should be supported will go to the HSE's management committee for a decision. It makes its decisions on independent assessment of the impact versus the cost. We have seen previously that companies have been looking for exorbitant costs for some medication. The Minister has taken initiatives with other colleagues in other countries, including the UK, Scotland and Australia, to seek to ensure all health patients on public lists get access to medication on fair terms. This is where the issue rests. In the same report mentioned by the Deputy, I saw the HSE needs more cost-effective pricing from a company to ensure the drug can be made available to public patients. I appeal to the company to ensure the pricing of such products, which can transform people's lives, is set at a reasonable level so public patients, whether here or in other countries, can gain access to them. The Government has sought to deal with this national issue, but in terms of individual products it is down to the HSE to make that decision. This decision-making process, I understand, is not yet complete.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	31	The Minister knows that in the past a life-saving drug was approved for cystic fibrosis patients. The plight of the patients on Respreeza has attracted far less interest, perhaps because they are older and fewer in number. As well as the approximately 20 patients on the access programme another 40 people with alpha 1 are waiting to receive it should the HSE give approval. I make this plea in the House. This involves the small number of 20 people, but this is how they have been living in recent months: they are only told this month whether they are approved for next month. It is literally like being told, "We are not sure yet whether we will allow you to have a proper quality of life or whether you will start to slowly die". This is an awful thing to have to say about these people, but it is how they are being treated. I beg the Minister for Health to give these people certainty today. Sit down with the drugs companies, call them to order and ask them to have sense. They have a public and moral responsibility to help these poor people. I am not fighting with the Minister, but I am asking him to tackle this work please. Nothing could be more important than saving people's lives and I ask the Minister to do this please.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	32	It is very unfair if the company has given 20 people compassionate access to a life-transforming drug and is seeking to withdraw it from these patients as part of a negotiation to get a better price deal or wider access. This seems to be a very unfair approach by the company. There are responsibilities on the company. If it gives access to a life-transforming product it should sustain it for those people in a pilot programme. Of course there are issues on the wider front, regarding the HSE deciding on the efficacy of the drug and the possibility of extending it to a much wider number of patients.That has substantial economic cost. The Minister has just negotiated a saving of €650 million for access to new drugs by taking a hardheaded approach to negotiating with companies but these 20 patients should not lose their access to this product so that a negotiation can be concluded on more favourable terms. The approach of Government, to seek international support and put on a united front to get a decent deal for public patients, is the right one.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	34	I am not wrong. The HSE and the company are in negotiation about its longer-term use in the wider public service. As I understand it, the company provided 20 patients with compassionate access to this product as a demonstration of its efficacy. I do not believe that should be withdrawn in the process of a discussion about its longer-term use.

That would suggest the Government is throwing in the towel in respect of a hard Border. Can the Minister deny the report? The Minister will be familiar with minimum notice provisions in the Employment Act. Does he have any plans to brief colleagues on that?

He said yesterday that he had met with virtually all the leaders of Government across the EU to make a very strong case over the particular significance of this. It would be a huge backward step and he pledged that it would be top of the political agenda. This is not a technical issue, nor a customs issue. It is one he has recognised as being at the top of the political agenda.

Yesterday, decades of international consensus on a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute were summarily dumped by US President, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu. The consequences of this are potentially disastrous for the entire region. When will the Government make good its commitment? When will it formally recognise the state of Palestine?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	43	The Government is disappointed with the reports of a shift in policy from the US, though it is not yet clear what it will mean in practice. The Government's position remains the same. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has been trying to get a Middle East peace process under way with initiatives by both France and Sweden. Recognition could be helpful but it would only be decided in the context of ongoing work in the Middle East peace process. That will determine when recognition should occur but the Government is absolutely committed to a two-state process as a solution to the issues in Palestine.

They are in a desperate situation because they have been blackguarded and treated badly by the Irish Greyhound Board for the last four years. Several Ministers have ignored this matter and have reappointed their own cronies onto the board. While Rome burns, they are wasting time and tracks are being closed. We have seen the closure of Harold's Cross and we see that Clonmel in County Tipperary is also down for closure, along with two or three other tracks around the country. Ordinary people are supporting the greyhound industry while blackguarding and skullduggery is going on at the top management level with waste and unaccountability. I want to know what the Minister is going to do about it.

The board member, Mr. Brendan Moore, wrote to the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and warned him about all of this in the past, but nothing has happened. The Minister said there was satisfaction with the way in which the IGB was operating, but now we see the company is bankrupt and has to sell assets. On behalf of all the genuine greyhound owners and people who go to tracks, this is a disgrace. What will the Minister and the Government do about it?

This House voted to give €16 million to the Greyhound Breeders Association a couple of weeks ago. We were the only party that voted against that because we saw this crisis coming. This is a crisis that has been ongoing for a long time and we need to ensure that something is done immediately to address it. The greyhound Bill is supposed to be coming before the House. When is it due and will it deal with the matter? We cannot continue with this situation.

I will not reiterate what Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has said, but clearly there is an opportunity in that legislation to expand and reintroduce an enhanced motorised transport grant for people with disabilities. That grant was to have been reintroduced some time ago. In that regard, could we expect to have a full review of the primary medical certificate to ensure that there is equity for many of those who hitherto have failed to be treated fairly and who need same?

In considering the primary medical certificate we should look at those born with a specific condition. For example, if a person is born as an albino and is visually impaired, we could include that condition. It is the same as dwarfism. Currently, the primary medical certificate is limited to five different categories: loss of a limb or half a limb, loss of a leg or half a leg, or dwarfism. An extra category of people with congenital conditions should be added in order to include them.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	59	This is an important and challenging area. I recall that the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, was dealing with this matter. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, is currently drafting legislation in this area. The heads of the Bill are at an advanced stage, so hopefully it will come to Cabinet in the near future. However, it has been difficult to get the balance right in this area and to ensure that the legislation is legally robust, as well as being fair to all concerned. Hard work has gone into trying to produce a robust system.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	60	Earlier this week, the Minister published the DEIS plan.This plan does not even restore the funding for DEIS schools to 2015 levels. There is actually €13 million less in funding, no plan to restore the rural co-ordinator and no plan to increase the number of NEPS psychologists. There are only ten additional NEPS psychologists which is inadequate for DEIS schools which are faced with a range of complex problems in disadvantaged communities. The figure the Minister provided from the Department that there were 500 schools without NEPS psychologists is not correct. I received a phone call from NEPS this very week and note to the Minister that there are actually 600 schools without NEPS psychologists. I ask the Minister to update the Dáil record to ensure he is not misleading the public or schools. I also ask the Minister to consider reinstating the funding to 2015 levels, reinstating the rural co-ordinator and ensuring that all schools across the State have adequate access to NEPS psychologists.

The programme for Government sets out the objectives of the DEIS programme. Tipperary town in my constituency had five schools applying for DEIS status which felt they should have qualified. Tipperary town ticks all of the boxes according to the DEIS criteria. We have been told there is no appeal process for schools to appeal the decision of the Minister. We would like it explained clearly to us why schools in a town like Tipperary, which is clearly disadvantaged, failed to qualify for DEIS status.

One of the urban schools is the newest and biggest school in Newbridge where the children come from very socially disadvantaged backgrounds. In terms of rural areas, there are three at this point in time. As the Ceann Comhairle knows, we have many small rural schools in south Kildare. Whatever criteria were used, one school in Coill Dubh is very close to a school in Derrinturn-----

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	68	My objective is to ensure that every child who comes to our schools from a background of social disadvantage or with a special need can fulfil his or her potential. I have reviewed both the DEIS scheme and the resource teaching allocation scheme and I am investing €70 million extra in those programmes in the coming year. This is the first time in eight years that any new school has been introduced to this scheme. We have 80 new schools coming in. I admit that it is two per constituency and that many Deputies will be able to point to other schools which they would like to see included. I assure Deputies, however, that this has been done on a fair and objective basis using objective data unlike the previous occasion when it was done very haphazardly. This is fair and objective. Of course, we will refine it over time. Anyone who feels a case has not been fairly assessed can look for a review of the selection. I recognise that what we are doing here is selecting the schools with the greatest needs. These 80 schools are the ones which were identified as having the greatest needs. That is where my resources are going. I assure the House that I am committed to continuing to improve the way we deploy resources to assist the children with the greatest need in our schools.

It has instructed pharmacies to dispense prescriptions only on a weekly basis, despite the fact that patients have monthly prescriptions. Can the Minister confirm whether pharmacies will issue four separate dispensing fees instead of a monthly fee? Will that involve an extra financial cost? Does the Minister accept that the change will create multiple layers of bureaucracy and affect patients with mobility issues, such as MS, and elderly patients? Patients will now be forced to collect prescriptions on a weekly, as opposed to a monthly, basis. What is the rationale for the decision? Will the Minister give a commitment to review this matter?

In December, the House passed the rent pressure zone legislation which currently covers 12 areas. Many struggling renters are not covered by the legislation and are at risk of losing their homes. Will the Government reconsider changing the criteria in the legislation to make it available to all struggling renters? More importantly, will it reconsider its opposition to real rent certainty to deal with the crisis in the rental sector?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	74	As I outlined earlier, the Minister has introduced a framework to provide greater rental certainty and put a cap on increases. He is also rolling out the HAP programme which will only come into effect next month in Dublin. A pilot HAP programme is operating in Dublin, whereby people at risk of homelessness can get access to an uplift on the amount paid to them. Initiatives are in place. The Minister continues to review the operation of all of those initiatives to try to make sure that, where possible, they can be improved. As I mentioned to Deputy Howlin, the focus is on supply which, as everyone recognises, is the long-term solution to the pressure in the rental sector.

orchestrated campaign to discredit Sergeant McCabe as alleged in Superintendent Taylor’s Protected Disclosure;— bearing in mind allegations that there may have been inappropriate contacts between An Garda Síochána and TUSLA in relation to Sgt McCabe, Garda Keith Harrison and concerns that such contacts may have also taken place in relation to other members of An Garda Síochána who had made allegations of wrongdoing within An Garda Síochána;— noting that a public inquiry is the most appropriate way to investigate these serious allegations so as to ensure public confidence in An Garda Síochána and to respond to the public disquiet caused by these allegations;resolves that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, to be chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton, Judge of the Supreme Court, to inquire urgently into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:[a] To investigate the allegation made in a Protected Disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, on the 30th of September, 2016, by Superintendent David Taylor, wherein he alleges that he was instructed or directed by former Commissioner Martin Callinan and/or Deputy Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan, to contact the media to brief them negatively against Sergeant Maurice McCabe and in particular to brief the media that Sergeant McCabe was motivated by malice and revenge, that he was to encourage the media to write negatively about Sergeant McCabe, to the effect that his complaints had no substance, that the Gardaí had fully investigated his complaints and found no substance to his allegations and that he was driven by agendas.[b] To investigate the allegation of Superintendent Taylor in his Protected Disclosure, that he was directed to draw journalists’ attention to an allegation of criminal misconduct made against Sergeant McCabe and that this was the root cause of his agenda, namely revenge against the Gardaí.[c] To investigate what knowledge former Commissioner Callinan and/or Commissioner O’Sullivan and/or other senior members of the Garda Síochána had concerning this allegation of criminal misconduct made against Sergeant McCabe and whether they acted upon same in a manner intended to discredit Sergeant McCabe.[d] To investigate the creation, distribution and use by TUSLA of a file containing false allegations of sexual abuse against Sergeant Maurice McCabe that was allegedly sent to Gardaí in 2013, and whether these false allegations and/or the file were knowingly used by senior members of An Garda Síochána to discredit Sergeant McCabe.[e] To investigate whether the false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by Commissioner O’Sullivan to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe at the Commission of Investigation into Certain Matters in the Cavan/Monaghan district under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin O’Higgins.[f] To investigate whether senior members of An Garda Síochána attempted to entrap or falsely accuse Sergeant McCabe of criminal misconduct.[g] To investigate such knowledge which former Commissioner Callinan and Commissioner O’Sullivan had concerning the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.[h] To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and:— Media and broadcasting personnel,— members of the Government,— TUSLA,— Health Service Executive,— any other State entities,— or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work;relevant to the matters set out in [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.[i] To examine all records relating to the telecommunications interactions used by Superintendent Taylor, former Commissioner Callinan and Commissioner O’Sullivan, in the period from the 1st of July, 2012, to the 31st of May, 2014, to ascertain whether there are any records of text messages or other telecommunication interactions relating to the matters set out at [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above and to examine and consider the content of any such text messages or other telecommunication interactions.[j] To examine all electronic and paper files, relating to Sergeant Maurice McCabe held by An Garda Síochána and to consider any material therein relevant to [a], [b], [c], [d], [e] and [f] above.[k] To investigate whether Commissioner O’Sullivan, using briefing material prepared in Garda Headquarters, influenced or attempted to influence broadcasts on RTÉ on the 9th of May, 2016, purporting to be a leaked account of the unpublished O’Higgins Commission Report, in which Sergeant McCabe was branded a liar and irresponsible.[l] To investigate whether a meeting took place between former Commissioner Callinan and Deputy John McGuinness on the 24th of January, 2014, in the carpark of Bewley’s Hotel, Newlands Cross, Co. Dublin and to examine and consider the circumstances which led to any such meeting, the purpose of such meeting and matters discussed at such meeting.[m] To investigate such knowledge which Commissioner O’Sullivan had of the meeting referred to in [l] above.[n] To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and TUSLA in relation to Garda Keith Harrison.[o] To investigate any pattern of the creation, distribution and use by TUSLA of files containing allegations of criminal misconduct against members of An Garda Síochána who had made allegations of wrongdoing within An Garda Síochána and of the use knowingly by senior members of the Garda Síochána of these files to discredit members who had made such allegations.[p] To consider any other complaints by a member of the Garda Síochána who has made a Protected Disclosure prior to 16th February, 2017, alleging wrong-doing within the Garda Síochána where, following the making of the Protected Disclosure, the Garda making the said Protected Disclosure was targeted or discredited with the knowledge or acquiescence of senior members of the Garda Síochána.And to adopt a modular approach to this inquiry so that the matters set out at [a] – [o] inclusive shall be inquired into in the first instance, and thereafter upon consultation with the Sole Member the Government shall, if requested by the Sole Member, take steps to appoint another Judge to continue and conclude the work of the Tribunal namely the matter at [p] above as the second module.And to report to the Clerk of the Dáil and to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters as expeditiously as possible;and further resolves that–(I) the tribunal shall report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis not later than three months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after twenty days of witness testimony of the tribunal on the following matters: (a) the number of parties then represented before the tribunal,(b) the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal,(c) the likely duration (so far that may then be capable of being estimated) of the proceedings of the tribunal, and(d) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report (including any matters relating to its terms of reference),(II) the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it;(III) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals; and(IV) the Clerk of the Dáil shall within 14 days of receipt of any report from the tribunal either apply to the High Court for directions regarding publication of the report or arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas."The Government has this morning approved draft resolutions to establish a tribunal of inquiry. The resolutions, which accompany this statement, must now be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry are comprehensive and clear in their focus. Mr. Justice Peter Charleton will chair the tribunal and is available to begin work this week. I thank him for taking on this role.  There has been much debate and discussion in this House about the best way to establish the truth in these matters. I thank the Members for their genuine engagement to identify the key issues that should be included. What is now proposed reflects those discussions and the information put into the public domain last week. These terms of reference will establish a public tribunal of inquiry get to the truth. That is in the interests of whistleblowers and the interests of members of An Garda Síochána, particularly those against whom allegations have been made, and it is in the public interest. What is required is that the issue of how whistleblowers in An Garda Síochána have been treated is examined independently, fairly and publicly. For the first time, we will hear in public all sides of the story. I have said to this House previously that it would be wrong to try to remedy one injustice by creating another one. Everyone has basic human rights and it would be a cruel irony if our beliefs about the appalling treatment of some led to the ill-treatment of others. Hearing the other side is a basic requirement of fair procedure. I will now turn to the terms of reference. The tribunal will, of course, look at the matters originally recommended by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill. I am in Mr. Justice O'Neill's debt. We discussed them here in detail last Thursday. I thank him for the work he did and I thank Mr. Justice Charleton for his willingness to serve as the chairman of the tribunal. The original recommendation was for a commission of investigation. The terms of reference now contains specific references to the contacts between gardaí, Tusla, the Health Service Executive and other agencies regarding Sergeant McCabe. While allegations which were put into the public domain about Garda Keith Harrison, Tusla and Garda Harrison's general treatment were different, nevertheless, because of concerns expressed to me by quite a number of Deputies, I have included contacts between gardaí and Tusla in the first module. In the light of specific concerns which have arisen, the tribunal will look at whether there is a pattern relating to Tusla files and their use to discredit Garda whistleblowers. Many Deputies felt it was important to examine whether a pattern existed. People have said that a pattern might have existed because there are two known cases so that is part of the terms of reference.  The tribunal will now also look at certain matters relating to the O'Higgins commission. It will also look at whether senior members of An Garda Síochána attempted to entrap or falsely accuse Sergeant McCabe of criminal misconduct. There has been a lot of debate in this House and elsewhere as to whether we should look at how other gardaí who have made protected disclosures have been treated. I am providing for a new module which will allow the tribunal to look at these cases in the context of action to target or discredit gardaí who had made protected disclosures. GSOC will continue its work regarding complaints outside of these. There is a provision that Mr. Justice Charleton may consult with me if another judge may be needed to deal with the second module. The priority will be dealing with the issues arising in the first module. We are specifically providing that the tribunal can look at contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and any other relevant person that the tribunal may deem necessary. I want to put it on the record of the House that this would include Members of the Oireachtas. Mr. Justice Charleton will decide on what is seen as relevant. Quite a number of people mentioned this as well.  I know Mr. Justice Charleton is anxious to commence his work immediately and is determined to carry it our as expeditiously as possible. Once the resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas today, I intend to make the necessary statutory instrument so his work can start immediately. That work will report to this Dáil. I look forward to the recommendations Mr. Justice Charleton will make and I look forward to the truth. We have already made extensive reforms relating to An Garda Síochána. The reality is that more cultural change is needed in An Garda Síochána because reform can never stop. We will now also have the benefit of advice from an international independent policing expert. I want to make it clear that this work will complement the work of GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, which have all done and are doing very important jobs in this country.  I will now refer to the six questions contained in the McCabe's statement relating to An Garda Síochána to which they understandably want answers. As I have already said in the House, I want to facilitate them as much as possible but I do not want to pretend to the House that this matter is completely straightforward in circumstances where a tribunal is being established. Having consulted with the Attorney General, the Secretary General of my Department has written to the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 40 of the Garda Síochána Act and the power I have under that requesting the information sought in the six questions.I expect that it will be necessary to consult further with the Attorney General once the Commissioner has replied. Our action today will ensure that any wrongdoing around the issues we have been discussing here within An Garda Síochána will be addressed fully and fairly. I believe that is what Deputies across this House want to see. I believe the terms of reference I am putting forward today will enable the judge to do just that. As I have said before in this House, I have always been careful and scrupulous to deal with all the cases that have come to my attention. I have already put it on the record of the House that I do not have the authority to investigate protected disclosures coming from An Garda Síochána. That is the role of GSOC. I have always made the case, publicly and privately, in all of my dealings, for example, with Garda management, that whistleblowers should be protected and supported. For example, my own bona fides on this could be seen when I referred the charter for police policies on whistleblowing to the independent Policing Authority to examine it and come back to me with recommendations. This tribunal will ensure justice for Sergeant McCabe, his family and all parties involved. That is what is important. I ask Deputies across the House for support for this motion. I believe that it is thorough in its terms of reference that I put before the House today. I have been able to include the vast majority of issues that have been brought to my attention and the key points that have been made to me by Deputies. It also includes all of the recommendations that Mr. Justice O'Neill made that we discussed here last week. I believe there is general agreement that it is important to continue to include those recommendations from the judge, which I followed in full. I have extended them to deal with the issues that I have spoken about this afternoon. I commend this motion to the House and I am sure all Members will join with me in wishing Mr. Justice Charleton well in his task of great importance.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	83	We will be supporting the motion. If both Houses support this resolution, this State will establish a tribunal of inquiry for the 31st time since the foundation of the State. Of those 31 tribunals of inquiry, it is interesting to note that six of them have been into activities of An Garda Síochána. In fairness to An Garda Síochána, seven of them have been into the activities of politicians. Therefore, gardaí do not head that league table. Although tribunals of inquiry fulfil very important tasks, it is important to note that they do not administer justice. We need to look to see what the background was to the establishment of tribunals of inquiry. The Act was enacted in 1921 because a Member of Parliament made allegations against a Minister. He wanted them investigated. He did not want them investigated by a parliamentary committee because he wanted the witnesses to be able to take the oath. As a result, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was enacted. That Act forms the basis for the resolution that we are seeking to pass today. In passing, I wish to note a comment made by Deputy Pearse Doherty a number of days ago when he referred to the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, which was instituted in 2005 and was at Report Stage in 2011. I believe it would be beneficial if we proceeded to enact it. However, it will not be possible to enact it prior to the passing of this resolution. It is important to note that the function of a tribunal is to establish the truth. What we are doing is asking Mr. Justice Charleton to look at the facts, hear the evidence and come back with a report telling us what he views as being the truth. It is not the function of a tribunal to apportion criminal liability. People might think that there is going to be a finding of criminal wrongdoing or an imposition of a sanction against an individual as a result of the inquiry at the end of this process, but that is not going to happen. It is also not the case that there are going to be any civil findings requiring an individual to pay damages to another individual. That is not the function of a tribunal. It is the function of the courts. I know that we criticise tribunals in this House and we are perfectly entitled to do so. However, we create them and we have a responsibility to try to ensure that they are efficient and not as costly as they have been in the past. The most important issue when it comes to the efficiency of a tribunal of inquiry is the setting of its terms of reference. Some terms of reference in the past have been exceptionally broad and have led to those tribunals continuing for a long period. I believe the terms of reference that have been put forward by the Tánaiste with the assistance of other Members are appropriate. I believe they cover what is required. They are issues that should enable this tribunal to conclude its business. I believe it would be helpful to quickly go through the individual terms of reference. Paragraphs [a] and [b] are paragraphs that were recommended by Mr. Justice O'Neill. Paragraph [c] is a proposed amendment that I raised in the House last Thursday and I am glad to see that the Tánaiste has accepted it. Paragraph [d] is a more specific version of paragraph [c] since it relates to the creation, distribution and use by Tusla of the file of which we became aware. Paragraph [e] asks the tribunal of inquiry to look into certain actions of the commission of investigation. It is worthwhile to note that we are asking a tribunal of inquiry to investigate some aspects of a commission of investigation. However, this role is limited to whether false allegations or other unjustified grounds were knowingly used at the commission of investigation to discredit Sergeant McCabe. I believe the transcripts of the commission of investigation would be helpful to the tribunal. For the purposes of this, I assume that section 45 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 will apply and that the tribunal will be able to access those transcripts. Paragraph [f] determines whether there was any plan to entrap or falsely accuse Sergeant McCabe. There were some broad allegations in respect of that. Paragraph [g] was in Mr. Justice O'Neill's report, as was paragraph [h], although we have added to it "members of the Government". I note that it has also been increased to include Tusla and the HSE. Paragraphs [i] and [j] were in Mr. Justice O'Neill's initial proposed terms of reference, as was paragraph [k]. I note that the Government changed some of the wording in paragraph [k], which concerns the national broadcaster. The words "planned and orchestrated" have been replaced with the words "influenced or attempted to influence". I believe that is probably a sensible change. It broadens it out and makes it viable. When it comes to the issue of time at this tribunal, one of the areas in which it may get into lengthy issues that could delay it concerns the area of journalistic privilege. I believe that is something to be noted. A very important factor, other than the terms of reference, concerns the cost of tribunals. We need to ensure that the State plays a role in order that the cost does not run inordinately high. We can do that by getting the State to inform parties beforehand that when they apply for representation, they must do so in the knowledge that their costs will only tax at a certain amount. If somebody is not satisfied with that, they can agree to pay their lawyers more or they can get other lawyers. It is important at the outset that the State says publicly to people seeking representation that there will only be a certain amount for representation and that the costs will be taxed at that amount. The process of a tribunal is effective in itself. People are brought before it. We will see in public the superintendent, the sergeant, the Commissioner and the former Commissioner give evidence. Their evidence will be given in public. It will be tested. The tribunal will test it and antagonists will be able to test it. Nobody goes into a tribunal with special treatment. I would suggest that it is not going to be a very pleasant experience for anyone, but the objective of it is to procure and establish the truth. The public issues and disquiet that have been revealed require that the truth is established. I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well in that regard. At the end of this process, all we will have is a report. In years to come, people in this House should not criticise Mr. Justice Charleton for that fact that all we got out the tribunal was a report. That is all we are asking him to do and all he can do. It is not for us to direct criminal prosecutions or civil liability cases.However, on the production of that report, it may be the case that other individuals such as other prosecuting authorities or investigating authorities might be able to use it as a roadmap if wrongdoing is revealed. Obviously, it can never be used as evidence. Sometimes tribunals of inquiry are played out in the media. Parties frequently like to get information out in the public domain before individuals give evidence before the tribunal. It would be preferable in this case if we allowed the tribunal hear all the evidence without any party trying to influence the outcome. Let every person go before the tribunal, give their evidence and let there be a conclusion by the judge at the end of it. It is important to note also that sometimes tribunals can be very demanding on people who hold positions in high office. We saw that in our own party when a former Taoiseach was before a tribunal of inquiry. However, the fact that one holds office does not mean that one cannot give evidence before a tribunal and continue in one's job. I refer to that because of the calls upon the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner has denied any wrongdoing. It is important that we deal with her issues promptly so that the public can see what the situation is and that a report can be produced. I want to make another point about the politicisation of calls for a Garda Commissioner to be removed. It is part of politics in this House that people call for politicians to resign, whether they are Ministers, Ministers of State or whoever. As Members we have to be careful that we do not bring into that group people on the outside who hold important jobs such as the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, the director general of RTE or the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána. We must ensure that we do not politicise those offices by having parties in this House calling for their heads when other parties in the House are not calling for that. That will damage the institutions they serve. It is very important that we try to re-establish public trust in An Garda Síochána. That trust exists but, unquestionably, it has been damaged by the revelations over the past while. The important function of this tribunal is to try to establish the truth. It is in the public interest for wrongdoing to be disclosed. If there is no wrongdoing it is also in the public interest for that to be disclosed as well. I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well in his task. He should be given the opportunity to do it without background noise from politicians or from the parties affected by the tribunal. Ultimately, we will have a report, and I believe the report will be to the benefit of Irish society.

I will get directly to the point. Yesterday, we met the Minister and brought to her seven separate proposals in terms of the changes we would like to see made. I am glad to say that six of those proposals have been taken on board in some capacity. There was an issue around the wording, and the Minister committed to do her best to try to include it. We mentioned to the Minister yesterday the possibility of including other whistleblowers in a way that would not delay the initial focus of the inquiry, which was Maurice McCabe and now Keith Harrison. I am glad to say that paragraph [p] now allows for that to happen. The fact that we are now introducing modules will allow for the initial public inquiry into the allegations and the cases of Keith Harrison and Maurice McCabe to be dealt with. There is a timeframe on an interim report of three months, which is less than what we had suggested to the Minister. We suggested a timeframe of four months so we welcome that. If the cases of other whisleblowers need to be examined, there is scope within the terms of reference for the judge to request an additional module. One of the other issues we asked the Minister to examine was the possibility, and we raised it last week, of including Members of the Oireachtas. I know that wording it in that way was somewhat problematic but under paragraph [h] the Minister has been able to achieve that where she states "or any relevant person as the Sole Member may deem necessary to carry out his work". I believe that covers any Member of the Oireachtas. We had also asked that Tusla and the Health Service Executive would be named in the terms of reference and we are glad to see that has been done. The other areas we wanted included, as I am sure did other Deputies, was to determine if there was evidence to indicate a pattern in terms of the way whistleblowers were being discredited and allegations were being made about them. That is included in paragraph [o], which is to investigate any pattern of the creation and distribution of Tusla files. My only concern about that is that it is narrowed to the use of Tusla files. I would have liked it to be extended to include whether there was a pattern regarding the use of media to discredit whistleblowers but, unfortunately, we have not been able to work that into the terms. I understand the reason for that, namely, that we wanted to keep the terms of reference as narrow possible but I would have liked to determine if there was a pattern in terms of the use of the media, and not just Tusla, to discredit whistleblowers. Only one of our proposals was not included, and we discussed this with the Minister yesterday. We had asked that the judge would be given the power to examine the protected disclosures, the way the procedures and protocols are working and whether he would recommend changes. The Minister agreed at our meeting yesterday that that is a piece of work we should probably undertake and gave a commitment that it is something we would like to undertake. It comes under the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister has given a commitment to discuss that with him. We would be eager to see that piece of work being done. I do not see any reason it cannot happen in tandem with the public inquiry. I understand the reason it is not referred to in the terms of reference but the Minister gave a commitment on it. There is an issue around the costs. My colleague, Deputy Doherty, will speak about that but we have to recognise that when a tribunal of inquiry is set up, one of the major criticisms from the public, and even from Members, is the cost. We believe there is a solution to that but it might mean holding back on agreeing the terms of reference until next week. I am not suggesting we should do that but it might be something the Minister would consider. We could look at bringing in emergency legislation, but I will allow Deputy Doherty to discuss that. My colleague, Deputy Tóibín, will speak also. Overall, we are satisfied with the terms of reference. We believe they will achieve what we hope to achieve and we will support them.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	86	I will make a couple of points. Gene Kerrigan, in a tweet about the smearing of Maurice McCabe, stated, "Of all the files in all the world, a serious allegation accidentally falls into the file labelled Sgt McCabe". We know that the Director of Public Prosecutions decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed to a court case regarding the initial allegation made against Maurice McCabe. Dozens, if not hundreds, of allegations fail to proceed past the DPP; they are usually the end of allegations. However, that was not so in this case. We know that Paul Williams decided to focus on this particular case and wrote articles in the Irish Independent subsequent to the decision of the DPP. Paul Williams then wrote that Deputy Micheál Martin decided to meet with the originator of the allegations and, as a result, Deputy Martin decided to send the allegations to the Taoiseach. I understand Paul Williams also wrote to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach then decided to hold an investigation into these particular cases. We have a case that failed to make it past the DPP, like hundreds of others, but this is different. The largest newspaper in the country takes a special interest in it, the leader of Fianna Fáil meets with the persons who made the allegations, and the Taoiseach states that he will investigate the case. What elevates this case beyond all others that failed to make it past the DPP?Maurice McCabe is a target of the allegation within the case. Smears need vectors. Some of these vectors are people who were used and some of them are people who use others. We need to make sure these relationships are properly investigated. My major worry in this is there are journalists who feel they have valuable information to offer to the tribunal but they know if they break cover or provide the information they may never work again. The key questions for me are how we ensure these journalists feel comfortable in providing this information and how we protect them in this scenario.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	87	I welcome the terms of reference. It is worth saying again that in the past week Maurice McCabe and Katie Hannon have done the State a great service because now we have before us far more robust terms of reference, and a tribunal of inquiry as opposed to a commission of investigation with limited terms of reference. I am very satisfied to see Keith Harrison being named in module one with regard to the connection with Tusla, and he will also be encompassed in the second module. The original claims by those whistleblowers also need to be investigated robustly. I want to focus on what I have been doing for quite a number of years with regard to the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005. It is wrong for us to proceed to establish a tribunal under the 1921 Act. We all know that legislation is flawed in the area of costs. The Law Reform Commission has produced a comprehensive report in this area. We have a Bill which deals with limiting the costs of tribunals of investigation which was approved by the Attorney General back in 2005 and which passed Second and Committee Stages. Elements of the Bill should not progress, but the core part of it on the reduction of costs of tribunals of inquiry must pass before we establish this inquiry. Do I want to stall in any way this tribunal of inquiry being established? No, I do not, but do we have an ability in this House and the Seanad to introduce that part of the 2005 Bill in the next week? Yes, we do. It would allow the sole member of the tribunal of inquiry to tell each witness the amount for which they would be covered for legal costs. No longer would we have witnesses coming in with five barristers and two junior counsels looking to recoup their costs from the State. The judge would decide what is appropriate for legal representation to be paid by the State. No longer would public relations consultants be allowed to be hired by witnesses and have their costs paid by the State. It would allow the Minister to set regulations to cap the amount paid for legal representation. We have the ability to do this. It is very simple. We have rushed through legislation in the past. The Taoiseach said to me earlier today he has requested a report on the issues I have raised. I ask the Minister, as we agree the terms of reference in the House, to consider bringing forward emergency legislation to deal with specific parts of the 2005 Bill and have them passed by the House. Sinn Féin will fully co-operate with the Minister, whether additional sittings, extra time or clearing schedules next week are necessary, to have it passed in this House and in the Seanad.

All of this began with the relatively low-key efforts of a decent man who wanted to highlight wrongdoing in our police force. That the situation has been allowed to escalate to a point where we are once again establishing a tribunal of inquiry is astonishing. The series of events have been a squalid affair. A man and his family have been subjected to a campaign of utterly false and damaging allegations. As my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, and others have highlighted, it appears he is not the only one to have been subjected to such a campaign. Public confidence in An Garda Síochána has once more been undermined. The very many honourable men and women working in An Garda Síochána to keep our society safe have had the integrity of their work undermined. A new agency created to better protect the children of Ireland from harm has had its reputation sullied. Questions once more arise as to how Ireland works to keep our children safe. These events are really damaging. They reveal dysfunction and worse that reaches across the fundamental pillars of a functioning State. Two of the most important institutions required to keep our people safe are damaged and the contagion has spread far beyond those bodies. Public administration, politics and the media have all been called into serious question. Here we are once more creating a tribunal of inquiry. We could recite the list of reforming legislation passed in recent years, much of it promoted by my party, to restore public confidence in this country and its institutions. Those of us with long enough experience might wonder realistically what impact the legislation has made. We might wonder whether we have learned anything at all about real implementation of effective systems to ensure openness and accountability in the conduct of public life. This is Groundhog Day as much of what we have witnessed will bring us all back to other events. What is required is deep introspection from us all as to what it says about aspects of society. I remember the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats tribunals of inquiry Bill referenced by previous speakers. It was described as a consolidation and reforming measure with a view to putting in place a modern comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of a tribunal from the time of its establishment to the publication of the final report. What was most important was that the Bill, if passed into law, would have enabled the Government, with the approval of the Houses, to dissolve a tribunal and wind up its inquiry before it was completed. The then Minister, of course, was right to complain about spiralling costs, but the motivation at that time was to give power to the House and its majority Government to collapse inquiries. The then Minister was entitled to say that at some stage we have to ask ourselves whether it is worthwhile proceeding any further in the circumstances and that we cannot go on forever, but the upshot of it was that when the Bill collapsed we lost the opportunity to control legal costs properly and properly punish time wasting and non-co-operation by witnesses under investigation. I agree with the views of others that we need to revisit the Bill, but not the motivation, in my judgment, of the part of it that wanted to collapse inquiries midstream. Legitimate concerns have been raised about costs. Some of these have been overstated. The commission of investigation model was intended to be a cheaper option, with a greatly reduced role for legal counsel. In reality, as we saw in the O'Higgins commission, multiple teams of lawyers were often present. I thank the Tánaiste for meeting me yesterday and for producing terms of reference which I believe encompass the issues I have raised. I wish Mr. Justice Charleton well. I hope his ambition to complete his work within the reasonable timeframe he has set out becomes a reality. The functioning of our State requires this. I expect his investigation will deliver a vindication to people whom the State has maligned. In darkness and shadows campaigns of vilification have been conducted. Perhaps the most important aspect of what we debate here today is that Mr. Justice Charleton will carry out his work in the clear light of day. I have a question for the Tánaiste to which I hope she can respond. Will she confirm to the House that she has already issued, or, if not, that she will issue later today, a directive to the Garda Commissioner under section 25 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to secure the preservation of all Garda records and equipment that may well be relevant to the inquiry and safeguard all evidence? As we embark upon yet another inquiry into An Garda Síochána, I hope truly meaningful reforms and, what is more important, cultural change will finally begin to take root.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	89	I also welcome the terms of reference which have been agreed and announced today. It has been a long week since my colleague, Deputy Howlin, made his statement in the Dáil. Many criticised him but that triggered the events which brought us to where we are now. My colleague acknowledged the work of everyone in the House and certain journalists but we would not be where we are today if he had not spoken. I also welcome the considerable movement in the past couple of days and even hours. The terms of reference are divided into two segments. The first module will deal with the disclosures of Sergeant McCabe and Superintendent Taylor and, thanks to the work of a number of people, those of Garda Keith Harrison, for which I also campaigned vigorously. There are similarities between his case and the others in the form of the role of Tusla and how he, Marissa and their family were treated but it would be impossible not to deal with how he was dealt with by gardaí. I seek an assurance that all his issues will be dealt with as part of this process because it would be impossible to separate them. The Department of Justice and Equality has now learned a unique lesson. It never wanted multiple whistleblowers' claims to be dealt with together in any inquiry or tribunal because to do so would show a pattern, a culture and similarities in the disclosures of numerous whistleblowers. It will give evidence to the people of Ireland of behaviour which is disgraceful. We also need to ensure that there is criminal sanction for wrongdoing. Today may not be the day to deal with that but we will have to come back to it.  I welcome the fact that the terms of reference cover all other whistleblowers as this is a very important facet of the inquiry, which will bring justice for the State and all the whistleblowers. While many whistleblowers will be covered by this inquiry, their daily circumstances are very different. Some are on pay; some are not. Some live on social welfare and there are many other issues. I urge the Tánaiste to look at the fact that some are being treated differently from others and that there is no consistency of treatment. I thank those in this House who worked to ensure the terms of reference were broadened. Sergeant McCabe issued a statement a number of days ago asking whether Ministers in this or the previous Government were briefed, formally or informally, on allegations against him. As a former Minister, I was not so briefed.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	94	The long and terrible struggle of Maurice McCabe and other heroic Garda whistleblowers is certainly not over but at least there is light at the end of the tunnel after the horrendous journey these whistleblowers have undertaken to expose wrongdoing, malpractice, criminal misconduct and corruption in the Garda Síochána, an institution which is supposed to uphold law and justice. After the despicable treatment, the vilification and intimidation of the orchestrated campaign against them, perhaps now they will find justice and full vindication and those responsible for the campaign against them can be brought to justice. I certainly hope so. They have shown bravery and determination but Maurice McCabe said today that if he had to go through it all again he might not do so. That is a very chilling thing because if one of the most heroic whistleblowers says he is not sure he would do it again it is a damning indictment of the State, the political system, the police and, indeed, our legislation on protected disclosures and tribunals and the encouragement given by this House to people to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in important institutions. We have a heavy responsibility to make sure this tribunal delivers justice for the individual whistleblowers and cleans out the rotten culture that appears to exist at the highest levels of An Garda Síochána, as well as in other State and non-State bodies that may have colluded in the despicable campaign of vilification and character assassination to defend practices that breached the standards An Garda Síochána is supposed to uphold. I reiterate the tributes to Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly, who have doggedly pursued this matter from the outset, despite attempts to impugn their characters. It seems to be a standard feature of the way the State and the system respond to political or other whistleblowers that the first line of defence is to attack the whistleblower.Hopefully, however, we are moving beyond that. While some journalists should be commended for the role they have played in bringing us towards the truth of these matters, particularly Michael Clifford and Katie Hannon in recent times, I would make a point about others. We have had serious allegations that members of the media may also have been involved in recycling the malicious rumours against Maurice McCabe. That is a very serious issue that has to be got to the bottom of. Over the last week or so, the tendency to try to move an issue which should have been about Maurice McCabe, the treatment of whistleblowers and the issues they were trying to uncover, as well as the need to ensure that we root out any corruption and malpractice in the Garda, too often slid into a political debate and a ding-dong between political parties. It was a debate, often encouraged by the media, about who was going to be Taoiseach, who would be in government and whether it would lead to an election. It should be about the issues, however. I think the terms of reference are comprehensive. I hope they will get justice for the whistleblowers but let us hope that we will also learn the political lessons from the debacle that has led us to this point.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	95	I welcome the fact that we are going to have a public tribunal of inquiry into this matter. Thanks for that go to Maurice McCabe and the other whistleblowers who must be commended for speaking out in the face of everything that has been thrown at them precisely for speaking out. What will be uncovered is only a glimpse of the dark underbelly of the State and how it can be used in such a way as to destroy people who pose a threat to those at the very top. It will raise the need for a much broader public inquiry involving those who are victims of injustice and looking into what has been the role of the State in our society. How have they managed to protect those at the very top and what is the relationship between them and members of the media? The timing of this debate is somewhat unfortunate. It would have been much better, and still would be, if we could have some time over the weekend to consider this and vote on it next Tuesday, instead of doing it now. I do not understand what the rush is for in that respect. I want to respond to a point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan that it is not appropriate for political parties, unless they all agree, to call for the Garda Commissioner to resign. I do not agree. I note that Senator Michael McDowell, a former Minister for Justice, called in the Seanad today for her to go. I just do not think it is credible that we are agreeing to set up a public inquiry into allegations that the Garda Commissioner conducted and orchestrated the blackest propaganda against members of her own police force, yet we are going to leave her in place where she could potentially play a role in obstructing the tribunal. The existence of a tribunal cannot be used as an excuse to avoid answering Maurice McCabe's six questions now or as quickly as possible. Nor can it be used to avoid criminal prosecutions which are needed. It cannot be that in a year's time we will have another tribunal report sitting on the DPP's desk gathering dust, and no prosecutions. If what is alleged is accurate, as I believe it is, prosecutions should follow. The costs of the tribunal have to be closely monitored, restricted and not allowed to balloon out of control so we do not have a situation of creating yet more millionaires from a tribunal. Similarly, the timing has to be watched. We are moving three separate amendments although they are listed as one. Amendments Nos. 2(a) and (b) constitute one amendment, while amendments Nos. 2(c) and 2(d) are the second and third ones. They should be taken separately because that is how they were submitted. We are seeking to delete the words "to ensure public confidence in An Garda Síochána" in the seventh paragraph. We do not think public confidence in the institution of An Garda Síochána is warranted. I do not think the tribunal should have a pre-ordained outcome that it will restore public confidence in An Garda Síochána. In fact, I think it is going to reduce public confidence in An Garda Síochána and will open a debate in society about what kind of police force we have and the need for a police force to be democratically accountable and controlled by the communities it is meant to serve.  Amendment No. 2(b) seeks to emphasise the point "that evidence obtained during the inquiry can be used in criminal prosecutions". Amendment No. 2(c) seeks to broaden the current reference to "members of the Government" to read "members and former members of the Oireachtas". In that way it would include Members of the Dáil but also Members and former Members of the Seanad. That is important because in the last 48 hours we had Deputy Deasy come out, as well as the former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and Deputy Durkan, all claiming to have heard of these allegations. Apparently, loads of the establishment party TDs were aware of these allegations but did not really do anything about them. It is not really understandable why they did not do something about it. It is, however, appropriate to broaden the reference to them. Reference has been made to a very good reason why we cannot do so. However, I do not see why it is appropriate to say "members of the Government" but not to broaden it beyond that.  Amendment No. 2(d) relates to broadening subsection [p] so that not only gardaí who have made protected disclosures before today would be covered, but also any garda who has made a complaint or allegation which could, for example, be an internal Garda complaint. If they have been subjected to these kind of smears, they should also come within this tribunal's remit.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	97	I welcome the terms of reference. I want to put on the record the fact that I appreciate the Tánaiste's decision to include the other whistleblowers, which I have been calling for for a long time. The terms of reference refer to "any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report." I feel, and maybe the Tánaiste has allowed for that, that Mr. Justice Charleton should be given the authority to make some policy recommendations around areas such as how we deal with whistleblowers, the gardaí-media relationship, the need for cultural change and legislative policy change. When he assesses everything before him, I imagine Mr. Justice Charleton will have interesting things to say about legislative policy. I argued with Deputy O'Callaghan last night on a few of these issues. I think that policing should be de-politicised. Some people think the argument for allowing a body like a policing board to have such influence over the Commissioner is dangerous, but I do not. I remind people that I recommended the inclusion of elected representatives on a policing board in a Bill back in 2013 and 2014. I recommended two Government and two Opposition representatives on the panel. I am not so sure that the notion of a sitting Commissioner going before a judge in public will be in the best interests of An Garda Síochána. The Tánaiste knows very well that I think it would be in the best interests of An Garda Síochána if the Commissioner was removed from her office. As I have pointed out before, section 11(1)(c) of the Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 states: "the removal of the person from office would, in the opinion of the Government, be in the best interests of the Garda Síochána." If it was not in the best interests before now, with the public inquiry going on, it will be even more so. It is very important that the Tánaiste should think again about whether the Commissioner is left in place because I do not think she is fit for office. Senior garda indiscipline is not within the remit of the policing authority and I think this is a mistake. The Guerin report and the Garda Inspectorate have called for the need to address how garda indiscipline is dealt with. Putting this under the Policing Authority makes perfect sense.Lastly, I touch on a point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan on politicising offices. He made the point that for elected politicians to call for the head of the Garda Commissioner is politicising it. I argue that having the ability to remove the Commissioner solely within the hands of the Minister of the day is an even greater degree of politicisation. If we are going to establish public trust in An Garda Síochána, removing the Commissioner would be a wonderful start. Hopefully, change is coming. I hope the Minister can bring it about and implement it. We need a new Commissioner from outside the jurisdiction and a change of the Garda hierarchy. A number of members will be standing down soon anyway and a facility of financial inducement should be put in place to encourage others to go. We need a clean sweep and different people dictating how we do policing. God knows there are a lot of really good gardaí in this country who have not got the chance they deserve to influence how we do policing. Too often, the wrong people have been promoted and that needs to change. I thank the Minister for her work this week. Most of us agree that Mr. Justice Charleton is an excellent choice. I am optimistic that he will do a good job.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	98	We are already on the record as saying we are concerned the issues have been a good bit rushed. We are a little bit worried about that albeit we hope our worries will not be realised. It is not the way we wanted it but we are where we are. I have heard nothing but good things about Mr. Justice Charleton and I really hope he can deliver without our worries coming to fruition. I echo the points about finances. I hope he is given the money up front to fast-track this and also that he is listened to in terms of broader recommendations he might have. We are satisfied that the terms of reference cover the key concerns raised in the protected disclosures of Maurice McCabe and David Taylor. Those allegations are, at their heart, that there was a campaign to undermine and discredit Maurice McCabe with the direct knowledge of the current and former Commissioners. Horrible and all as that is and upsetting as this entire episode has been for so many citizens, what is most frightening is the allegation that this was done in order to detract from what he was saying. What he was saying was that we have a systemic problem in An Garda Síochána and that the blue wall of silence has only been dented, not demolished. As a result, we have a second Morris tribunal because the recommendations of the first one and the required cultural changes were not implemented. We owe it to Maurice McCabe and the other whistleblowers to ensure that the bigger picture is not lost sight of. That is why we need a radical transformation of how we do policing. In fairness, the Minister is paying the price for not listening to us a number of years ago. While Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which was in government and stood over all of this, brought in legislation, it was not enough. The Minister has already accepted that the recommendations of the justice committee, which we released and which argued for a massive strengthening of the GSOC oversight and the role of the Policing Authority, should be looked at and addressed. We said that two years ago. If the Government had done it then, we might not be in the mess we are in now. It needs to be done now because, glaringly, the independent Policing Authority has been silent in the face of the biggest Garda crisis in our history because it has not been given a proper role of oversight or control over the Commissioner as it should have been. While I am happy with the terms of reference and I acknowledge very much the Minister's role in extending them, we have believed all along that there were really compelling reasons the other whistleblowers should have been included. They show an unbroken thread of bullying, harassment and intimidation once they made protected disclosures. Their input is going to be vital. Up until very late last night, and I know how late the Minister was up, they were not being included with the exception of the small Tusla allegation in Keith Harrison's case. I am very glad that they are all now going to be included in the second module which I hope comes sooner rather than later. We know tribunals cannot investigate matters which could be the subject of criminal sanction. As such, there must be a parallel criminal investigation in this regard. It is very worrying that no one is ever called to account for these matters. I bring the Minister back to what the media say this issue started with, namely the penalty points crisis. It did not really, but that was one of the things. The Minister's predecessor and herself put aside funds for GSOC to initiate a criminal or disciplinary investigation against the people responsible for that action.

Nothing has been done to call those individuals to account. We need an overhaul of GSOC with more funds and fresh blood from outside with the power of the Garda to launch a criminal investigation into these matters. My last point relates to the sitting Commissioner. It is untenable to have a Commissioner who is the subject of hugely serious allegations remaining in situ. It would not happen anywhere else. By virtue of creating a tribunal, it is in essence being said that her statements are not necessarily being believed. The idea that she would control the evidence vital for this tribunal to do its work is not acceptable not to mind the fact that no whistleblower will come forward while she remains at the helm. I am glad the terms of reference are as they are, but it is only a tiny bit of the job we have to do on this issue.

I thank the Tánaiste for briefing our Rural Independent Group yesterday and I thank Deputy Harty for turning up. I am very concerned about the haste here today given the seriousness of the issue. My experience is that one makes haste slowly. We do not want to have to come back here in six months having found that issues have arisen which we did not think through. I sought to raise that this morning at the Business Committee. Tribunals are chaired by judges and I wish this one the best of luck, but we do not have a good record with tribunals in this country. Look at the Flood tribunal and the beef tribunal under Mr. Justice Hamilton and the length of time for which they went on. Nothing came out of them except white smoke. I mean no disrespect to my learned colleague to my right, Deputy O'Callaghan, but all that came out of it was that the fat cats and lawyers got fatter and fatter.

He is not mean but lean and clean. I am sure they are rubbing their hands with glee and saying "Here we go again". They are not going to be on the dole queue for a long time but will be down in the Four Courts making hay while the sun shines. This is too serious. There are timescales in place and that is very important but we cannot get bogged down in legal argument and challenges. There are many other whistleblowers out there who will be encouraged by this to come out. What will happen then? Where is the limit? The Minister is including the most recent one of Garda Keith Harrison but if there are others who are encouraged to come out, where are we going to go? The Minister has said we must get to the truth and that is certainly the case. She said the terms of reference will establish a public tribunal of inquiry to get to the truth. That is in the interests of whistleblowers and gardaí, in particular those against whom allegations have been made, and it is in the public interest. We all know that. The truth is vital. However, are we going to get full co-operation? I hope we are. The judge will have full powers of compellability, but if findings are made against certain people, there will be no powers of prosecution. We will see some people rubbing their hands again. Their hands will be worn with the amount of rubbing because this will be going on and on with no definite action. What the people want and what we are entrusted to do is to root out the systemic rot in An Garda Síochána and Tusla. I have the greatest of respect for An Garda Síochána and its many good members, of all ranks, up and down the country and the work they have done and continue to do. Bad apples must be rooted out completely. I will not refer to the Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan remaining in place, but I was disappointed with the appointment process. We support people from abroad but appointed someone from within. We have to go outside the country. There needs to be a clean sweep and we must appoint someone who has had no involvement in Ireland if the current Commissioner is forced out of office or whenever the position becomes vacant. A criminal prosecution should happen side-by-side with the tribunal, otherwise the tribunal will be a smokescreen. Major allegations have been made and people's lives have been destroyed. It is not acceptable. In 2006 the Comptroller and Auditor General's report made recommendations on the costs of tribunals. It recognised that due to their investigatory nature the cost was difficult to estimate. It also stated that, nonetheless, good financial management demands that a mechanism be established to make the costs more predictable and transparent, which has not happened. The report went on to state that one possible approach would be to require the production of a formal public statement of estimated costs, a timescale and milestones at all key stages, beginning with the establishment of the tribunal. Timescales and milestones have been outlined, but there is no information on costs. The meters have already been turned on to deal with the enormous costs per hour or word. It is daft. The public does not want that. Is this what we are giving the public in the interests of getting to the truth? It will be further annoyed. As I said, the statement could be updated to take account of significant elements or propose new lines of inquiry. How will we handle that if it arises? We must consider the costs and what could be done with the money involved. Much of the support work at tribunals is done using counsel and there appears to be scope to achieve economies by using less experienced paralegal or professional staff for research and investigation work. I am not having a dig at my learned colleague, but we have to examine that because our experience has been that costs are a runaway train. We have to be accountable. There needs to be a move away from engaging counsel for discrete modules. We need to implement a scheme of predetermined fee rates for future tribunals which takes account of the certainty of the work of tribunals in determining those rates. I have a faith An Garda Síochána but I have no faith in Tusla. I opposed the children's rights referendum – I was the only Deputy to do so at the time. I have been vindicated because look at what we got. We rushed into different things. The Taoiseach engaged in silliness when he said he appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. He threw the current Minister under the bus during the week, or tried to do so. The Minister was not in the Chamber yesterday for one word of the debate. She was here to vote. I wished her well and complimented her when she returned from her trip to the United States for bringing clarity to what went on and where. It was a timely reminder to the Taoiseach of where he was and was not, and who he did and did not meet. It takes two people to meet. If one has an imaginary meeting, the other person can always say it did not happen. Superintendent Dave Taylor is a good Tipperary man and we have all met Sergeant McCabe. They know what has gone on. He has been reappointed to his position, which I welcome. We must get to the bottom of this matter. Reference has been made to Deputy Deasy and other Deputies. I discussed a case at some length with Deputy O'Callaghan which I could bring into a tribunal.

I mentioned what went on in Dungarvan Garda station several times regarding me and my family. It was depraved. As I said, there are many cases like that up and down the country. We are only scratching the surface. When will the culture change? As I said, 99% of gardaí want to do a good job but they get manipulated and the wrong people are promoted. The appointments are too political. I totally agree with Deputy Wallace. GSOC and its precursor, the Garda complaints authority, were toothless when I went to them with my complaint. They had no powers whatsoever. Many other people have come to me with similar stories. I do not want to cause friction with Deputy Howlin because we had enough of that last week, but the Labour Party was in Government for the past five years. Its Deputies held very important positions and should have dealt with these issues over the past five years. Many more things should have been dealt with by previous Governments. The issue is out there now and we have to thank a lot of people. We cannot become convulsed by this and forget about everything else. Other gardaí have different issues that have nothing to do with bullying, harassment or intimidation. They want to engage in ordinary policing. People in their homes are frightened and nervous. Not enough gardaí are in place and there have been cutbacks. We cannot waste money and forget about the public duty that gardaí have and their duty to the State to protect the people. We must support that at all times.

On Tuesday, I said this process cannot and must not be a ready-up between the Government and Fianna Fáil. Regrettably, that is what it has turned out to be. It is a very serious error to proceed on this basis in forcing through the terms of reference without allowing adequate time for consideration of their implications. The reason for doing this is to put the lid on this episode so that the Government, over the coming weekend, can refuse to answer questions that the public is legitimately asking and hide behind the proposed tribunal. It is unseemly for both groups to behave in this manner. It is also extremely disingenuous, given the agreement that was reached at the Business Committee on Tuesday, on foot of a proposal from Deputy Clare Daly to defer a decision on the terms of reference until next week in order to allow adequate consideration and for groups to take legal advice. This is far too serious a matter to rush through. It is inevitable that we will rue the day that this action has been taken in haste. If one acts in haste it is inevitable that one will repent at one's leisure. That is what is going to happen. When the Cregan inquiry was rushed through, we had to come back to grant further powers to the tribunal in order for it to carry out its work adequately. There is no reason to rush this through this week. There is no difficulty whatsoever with waiting until next week so that everybody has adequate time to consider the issues. If the Tánaiste had done that, as had been agreed by all parties, it would have allowed time for her to respond to the six questions that were raised by Sergeant McCabe. He requested an immediate response to the six questions, and his legal adviser set out the legal basis on which Ministers could respond to them.

I think we are rushing this and will regret it. We must be careful.

I do not see why we are restricting the investigation of records relating to telecommunications interactions between some of the key people - Superintendent Taylor, former Commissioner Callinan and Commissioner O'Sullivan - to the period finishing on 31 May 2014. It should run through to 31 May 2016. I have a concern where we state further on that the tribunal should "examine all electronic and paper files, relating to Sergeant Maurice McCabe held by An Garda Síochána and to consider any material therein [referred to]". We are relying on the Garda file when we should be resorting to some of the telecommunications files. I could be wrong. I could be misreading it. I only got it today so I am only just working through it. However, crucially, as I read it, paragraph [k] refers to investigating whether Commissioner O'Sullivan-----

Paragraph [k] provides that the tribunal is "To investigate whether Commissioner O'Sullivan, using briefing material prepared in Garda Headquarters, influenced or attempted to influence broadcasts on [that RTE broadcast] on the 9th of May, 2016". My concern is whether that would restrict the tribunal if there was another guard who was influencing that process. Are we narrowing the terms of reference with that language? Is there a point there or am I just misreading it? Are we over-restricting the terms of reference in those three paragraphs, that is, paragraphs [i], [j] and [k]? This is critical because I do not think the Commissioner herself would have been in touch with RTE. It may have been a senior garda. Are we restricting the ability of the tribunal to investigate other guards' telephone records in terms of contacts to RTE? The way I read it, the concern I have, which I would like to hear answered, is that, with the way we have written it, we have restricted the telecommunications records inquiry to the period before 31 May 2014. When it comes to investigating that critical programme, are we in any way restricted? The Tánaiste is shaking her head. I would like to hear a reassurance in that regard. Why would that not be read as an instruction to the tribunal only to investigate Commissioner O'Sullivan's actions? Could legal arguments be made by other parties who would be very interested in this to say that the tribunal cannot investigate their records in regard to what happened in May 2016 because the terms of reference do not include it? I raise this issue for that one reason. I know the time has been short and that the Tánaiste has been accommodating, but I still have concerns that we are rushing this. My concern is increased because of what I have seen in previous tribunals, which I do not have time to state here.

I also welcome the terms of reference in so far as I have had an opportunity to check them out. I believe that this is being rushed. The terms of reference were published at 12 noon today, which was approximately three hours ago. It would have been opportune to allow the Members of the House to peruse and check the terms of reference over the weekend. This could well create a situation where the terms of reference do not include everything and there may be difficulties down the road. I welcome that we are having a public inquiry. The original proposal for a private inquiry - effectively one in secret - was not acceptable or good enough and was effectively a cover-up. It suggested a cover-up. We should have a parallel criminal investigation undertaken by an external police force identified by the Members of this House. That is the only way to deal with this astonishing and shocking situation which has had huge repercussions for individual members of An Garda Síochána and their families. It is clear that the whole situation arose from a systematic intimidation of whistleblowers by senior gardaí. In that respect, I welcome the fact that other whistleblowers are being included in the investigation. I also believe the role of the media should be examined seriously by the judge. There is no doubt that pet criminal correspondents were used to spread false accusations against members of An Garda Síochána. The judge will need to examine that seriously and completely.

I thank all Deputies, particularly those Deputies that are supporting the approach I have taken to the terms of reference. I have attempted to make them inclusive of the concerns people have identified to me in the various submissions I received from the various parties, Independents and other people. It was extremely helpful to have the level of detail of those who made written submissions as well. Not everyone did, but I thank those who did make them. I believe I have faithfully reflected the main concerns that have been expressed in this House on how we deal with these issues. I am not in a position to accept any of the amendments. Primarily and briefly, I would say that the Department is covered by the term "any other State entities", Members of the Oireachtas are covered by "any [other] relevant person". That is a clear reference on my part. I can tell Deputy Eamon Ryan that the reference to May 2014 relates to the protected disclosure. Those were the relevant dates that the person in question, who was Superintendent Taylor, was the press officer. That is why those are the dates, which came from Mr. Justice O'Neill. On the other point that Deputy Ryan made, the terms of reference relating to RTE came from Mr. Justice O'Neill, who had examined all the evidence relating to the protected disclosure. Based on his examination, he decided that was the appropriate formulation in terms of the particular issue in the protected disclosure.The terms of reference for that matter are totally linked to the protected disclosure and Mr. Justice O'Neill's assessment of and recommendation on how they should be dealt with. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a suggestion on costs, which I will follow up in so far as we can do anything. I will certainly pursue the suggestions he has made and I am sure Mr. Justice Charleton will be equally concerned to do that.  A point was made on the media. The media are included in the terms of reference and it is entirely up to the judge to decide, based on his interpretation of the evidence before him, which media outlets to approach. It will be at the discretion of the judge to decide how he will deal with many of the points raised by Deputies. The way in which tribunals of inquiry operate is that the judge decides how precisely to carry out the terms of reference. The judge will have considerable discretion in regard to bringing in relevant people, how media will be defined and so on. These decisions will be clearly based on the evidence before him. Deputy Mick Wallace made a point on recommendations. One would expect, based on the work of the tribunal, that the judge would be in a position to make recommendations and this would include policy recommendations in respect of the subject matter of the tribunal of inquiry. I do not have to repeat what the inquiry will cover. This issue is built in to the terms of reference.  While it would be extremely difficult to do emergency legislation on changing tribunals of inquiry, I will examine whether it is feasible to do so. Perhaps I will be able to consult the judge on that matter. My advice to date, however, is that it would not be feasible to do so.  I will mention a few other points that were made. The Health Service Executive is included.

I cannot check or discuss with one party that is subject to the tribunal of inquiry whether it is happy with the terms of reference or the work the Oireachtas does. This is a matter for the Oireachtas. It would be prejudicial to the work of the tribunal of inquiry if I were to check out the terms of reference to any party to it. I believe every Deputy will accept and understand that. The terms of reference are sufficiently broad to encompass the various issues that have been in the public arena.

Everyone who has been in contact with Mr. Justice O'Neill and every party to the tribunal has indicated he or she will co-operate fully. If anybody was to begin to disregard or try to interfere with the evidence that is needed for the tribunal of inquiry, that would be the most serious charge. The point raised by Deputy Howlin and others about preservation of evidence and so on is one of the reasons I am keen to establish the tribunal of inquiry speedily. The quicker Mr. Justice Charleton gets on with the work, the more protective it will be of the point the Deputy raised. I can examine the issue of a section 25 direction but I believe Mr. Justice Charleton will work on that issue as soon as we establish the tribunal.

It has always been the case that issues raised at a tribunal of inquiry can subsequently be subject to criminal investigation, although the evidence must be otherwise established. As I stated, we have seen previously that if there is evidence, criminal proceedings can be taken at the same time as a commission and those proceedings have precedence over the work of the commission.

I know it is the Minister's intention to enhance it. What are the targets envisaged in that regard?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	The Government has agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. At present, there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles. The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the figure and represents a medium-term target of 20% civilians over the next five years. That will bring An Garda Síochána, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women are available for and utilised in operational areas. To support the implementation of this vision, budget 2017 has provided funding for 800 Garda trainees, 300 Garda Reserve trainees and up to 500 civilians. The recruitment and appointment of the additional civilians will help to address capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation and at the various levels. I will not go into the details of that now. We will reach the 20% target by identifying gardaí filling roles that could be occupied by suitably qualified civilians - the Garda Inspectorate has indicated there may be in the region of 1,500 in that situation, although the number is disputed - and by the application of a civilian-by-default policy under which all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, will be filled by civilian staff with the appropriate skills and expertise. We are committed to moving ahead on the recruitment of 500 civilian staff this year.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	I thank the Tánaiste for her response. The reason I raise the question is because we know that a 2015 Garda Inspectorate report pointed out that the Garda Síochána had a relatively low percentage of civilians within its force. It calculated the number of civilians as being in the region of 14%. When one compares that to the situation in neighbouring police forces - for example, in Scotland, there is approximately 25% civilianisation and the PSNI has 26% - the figure here is quite low. I am aware the Minister previously announced plans to double the number of civilian staff in An Garda Síochána by 2021 but we must broaden civilianisation and recognise that at the top level of An Garda Síochána it is really a management job. I know we spend a lot of time talking about An Garda Síochána. It is obviously a policing job but it is even more so a management job and we need to have civilians at the top in terms of civilianisation to ensure the force is properly managed.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	During 2017 it is anticipated that there will be a redeployment of 147 Garda members as a result of increases in civilian numbers. That equates to some 30% of the 500 civilian appointments approved for the year, leading to redeployments. The process will accelerate in future years. I fully agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that we must ensure that where civilians can do the work within An Garda Síochána we must do everything possible to make sure that happens. I accept that, as Deputy O'Callaghan indicated, we are below the international levels in regard to civilianisation. We have gardaí doing jobs that could clearly be done by civilians, but the process must be managed in a careful and planned way. Some forces have advanced civilianisation in a rapid way and I have heard from them that one must be careful about identifying the particular posts.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	224	The benefit of civilianisation is that it allows the members of An Garda Síochána to be out on the street doing active policing, which is what communities want. There is also an advantage in the sense that one gets a different form of culture coming into the Garda. I do not criticise Garda culture, as that has been done enough this week, but in terms of any organisation, if one can get people in from outside one gets a mix of people within an organisation and that improves it. The Garda modernisation and renewal programme seems less than overwhelming about the process. It simply says there will be an increase in civilianisation and that it will be conscious of not developing a two-tier service. I do not think people should be fearful of that, as civilians and police officers can work hand in hand and complement each other. Is the Minister confident that the target of doubling the number of civilians will be achieved by 2021? That is a big ask. Will the Labour Court recommendations affect the process?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I am confident. The intention is to continue to move in the direction of the targets. The funding has already been given for this year for those 500 staff. Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the modernisation and renewal plan. I have requested the Policing Authority to monitor and assess the implementation of the plan and to report back to me not just once a year but on a quarterly basis. The Policing Authority will have an independent role in that regard and it can monitor the progress each quarter. That is another useful way of keeping track of progress. The modernisation and renewal programme is a significant one and it has a timeframe of five years. I agree with the Deputy that it is important the targets on civilianisation are met.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	The spent convictions legislation is relatively recent as the Act dates to 2016. It provides for certain convictions to become spent once seven years has passed since the date of conviction. Under the provisions of the Act, the following convictions which are more than seven years old are now deemed spent: all convictions in the District Court for motoring offences, with the proviso that spent convictions for dangerous driving are limited to a single conviction, and all convictions in the District Court for minor public order offences. The purpose of the legislation is to provide that persons who have made a mistake by committing a minor offence in the past and paid the price can move on with their lives after the appropriate time and that such persons will not be held back. The Act was commenced in full on 29 April 2016 and it would be sensible to review it after a reasonable period, as Deputies have approached me about other changes they would like to see. The Act will be liable for post-enactment scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. That can be done under the new Dáil procedures. I welcome such an approach. It is early days for the legislation but it is important for the committee to examine it when it is in a position to do so. I always take the recommendations from the committee very seriously and I am happy to look at it if it is on the programme of work.

I accept the legislation is very new. Prior to the enactment of the Bill I tabled a number of amendments. The Bill provides primarily for motoring offences and minor convictions but, given the current debate on drugs for personal use, we are moving away from a criminal justice model to a public health model for dealing with addiction. Unfortunately, if a young person, or someone who is not so young, is convicted of possession for personal use - I refer to very small amounts - the conviction hangs over the individual for the rest of his or her days. I would like to see any review take into account the fact that we are now moving to a new public health model in terms of drug use.

We have had very careful consideration of which offences should go into the first tranche of the legislation.Clearly, there is an emerging debate in respect of the Deputy's point about drugs and a greater focus on health and rehabilitation. I take the point he makes. The Minister of State with responsibility for drugs would have to consider it. I would want to hear what her view on it was and look at the evidence but the intention behind spent convictions is to give people a second chance. We have begun applying it to certain areas in this legislation. I have no doubt it will be extended at a later point but we would need to examine the implications of that proposal.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	Not examining it means that somebody who may have had a minor conviction for possession of drugs while in the throes of addiction but who has now gone through rehabilitation and is no longer addicted to and using drugs has a criminal record for the rest of his or her life. If we are serious about not only dealing with drug use as a public issue but also giving people a second opportunity, it is essential that people who have gone through the very tough process of rehabilitation are not labelled and stigmatised for the rest of their days. I hope the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs policy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will look at this in respect of the formulation of the new national drugs strategy. Ultimately, it will come down to the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of spent convictions.

A range of issues arises if a person has multiple convictions for drugs in terms of these convictions becoming spent. We would have to consider very carefully whether we should allow a greater number of drugs offences to become spent. I take the Deputy's generic point about rehabilitation and people getting a chance to move on but I am mindful that under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, the penalties for a third offence of possession of drugs is a sentence of up to three years' imprisonment so that is-----

I am asking the question in the context of a tragic event that befell a young man called Brian Regan from Loughrea who was killed in December 2015. It is a general question about licensing laws.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	I am not aware of the particular case referred to by the Deputy. I am not sure what element of the law is relevant to the case. The Deputy might point it out to me. We have a very large body of legislation relating to alcohol. There was a recent joint ministerial meeting on road safety. Clearly, the enforcement of legislation relating to drink-driving has been centre stage. I am sure the Deputy is very conscious of the recent proposals to change the legislation. Enforcing the legislation is a priority for the Garda. We are certainly making very big investments in terms of the resources and numbers of An Garda Síochána, including vehicles, all of which are relevant in terms of focusing on this. I have met with the senior garda responsible for this area. It is a priority area for the coming year. Of course, we have all seen the dramatic rise in road deaths. It is a combination of drink-driving, speed and use of mobile phones that has led to this rise. We must realise that we must repeat the messages for a new generation in terms of drink-driving and the dreadful impact it has on people.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	236	In fairness to the Tánaiste, she would not know the reason why I asked this question. I am asking it because I met with a man from Loughrea called James Regan who asked me to raise the issue of the licensing laws because of what happened to his son, Brian Regan, who was knocked down and killed by a car in December 2015 at 5.30 a.m. It was obviously a tragedy for him and his family. His father was concerned about the licensing laws. His son had been drinking from 7 p.m. that evening. Obviously, personal responsibility is an issue and he had responsibility for consuming alcohol himself but his father believes he was drinking late into the night in a licensed premises that was serving him alcohol when it was past closing time and the premises was not entitled to sell alcohol. He is not looking for inquiries. He is just anxious that the licensing laws we have are enforced. Most publicans do enforce them but it is important that when people come into public houses, they are under the supervision of the public house. We need to enforce the laws.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	237	That is an extremely tragic case. Unfortunately, there were many such cases last year when there was a considerable increase in deaths on our roads attributed to alcohol use. I take the Deputy's point that the enforcement of the law is extremely important. I emphasise that it is a priority area. It should be anyway but it is certainly a priority given the increasing number of deaths on our roads - primarily of young men aged between 18 and their late 20s. This is a particularly vulnerable group. I repeat that we need to repeat the road safety message and strengthen our legislation. The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which is the first legislation dealing with health promotion in this area, is extremely important and gives the message from this House that there can be no ambivalence in this area. We are famous for our ambivalence about alcohol but there can be no ambivalence when it comes to drink-driving.

It is also fair to say that if people are drinking, they are nearly better off drinking in a public house where they can be watched by the staff and a general assessment of whether they have had too much can be made. However, we must recognise the terrible ongoing effects alcohol can have on young men and the fact that it can lead to these tragic circumstances. Just because we presume that most of the licensing laws are obeyed should not prevent ongoing enforcement. I know An Garda Síochána takes the enforcement of the licensing laws seriously. We need to recognise that when somebody is not licensed to serve alcohol, serving it to people late at night is dangerous. The licensing laws are there for a reason, not just for the licensed premises but also to protect the public. People will keep drinking unless places close and we need to ensure the laws are enforced.

We all have work to do in this House in respect of the devastating impact of the misuse of alcohol and where it is linked to driving. We are seeing dreadful consequences for individuals and families and increased numbers. This is linked to the fact that there is a greater number of cars on our roads but it is primarily due to the fact that we see a combination of people, particularly young men, driving after drinking, speeding and using mobile phones. I compliment the father of that young man because it must be very hard to recover from that situation and promote the issues about which he is now speaking after having experienced such personal tragedy. We need to get on with the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and continue the Road Safety Authority campaigns.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	With regard to the proposed new station, I am advised that the Office of Public Works is in the process of acquiring part of the site at the former Kickham Barracks from Tipperary County Council. In the meantime - I am sure the Deputy is very familiar with this - a range of refurbishments has been going on. I hope to visit Clonmel in the near future because I am very concerned about the state of some of our Garda stations. I have been meeting with the relevant people from the Office of Public Works, An Garda Síochána and my Department in order to ensure that work is progressed. There is clearly a strong need for relocation given the situation there. When I announced the programme in October 2015 with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, it included an extensive programme of upgrades to the Garda station network, including works to the existing station at Clonmel. I have also given the Deputy the details of the work that is being done with regard to a new station.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	I thank the Minister for committing to visit Clonmel when I asked her to about three weeks ago. One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Clonmel Garda station is deteriorating and unfit for purpose. As I said, it is an early 19th-century building. The public office is not as big as the Clerk's table in front us in the House. It is tiny. It was refurbished lately in small bits. However, the building is higgledy-piggledy and people are always up and down stairs. The cells are not fit for purpose. Interview rooms and meeting rooms are the same. It does not have the facilities for the gardaí. I welcome the Minister's commitment to visit Clonmel. The site has been acquired by the county council. The old Army barracks is a very proud site and a very emotional issue for Clonmel. Some 1,000 incidents per month are dealt with by Clonmel Garda station. It is a huge district. It covers Carrick-on-Suir, Fethard and out to Clerihan. We also acknowledge new recruits that have arrived recently. More are on their way. They were badly needed. There is an excellent Garda workforce under superintendent Willie Leahy and his team. The building is antiquated. They have been waiting for so long. There were big hopes when the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, announced the move to the Kickham Barracks site three or four years ago, but nothing has happened. The Minister is working with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, as am I, to try to achieve that. It is part of a public private partnership along with other stations. My fear, the fear of the gardaí and the fear of the public I represent in Clonmel and Tipperary is that there are too many projects in that bundle and that other projects might not be at as advanced a stage as Clonmel. We need a big push. We have been talking about the Garda all week. Gardaí need to be supported. They need proper working conditions and so does the public that uses that station.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	243	I can confirm that it is intended that a new district headquarters will be developed in Clonmel by means of a public private partnership. That is obviously linked to the site acquisition. The proposed new station will form part of a number of stations that are to be built by means of public private partnership. That includes new developments at Sligo and Macroom. We want a new regional headquarters in Sligo as well. I have been at some of the meetings myself because I brought the different groups from the OPW, the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality together to discuss the building programme and to make sure that it now moves ahead in a timely way. We do want to deliver these new builds. I entirely take the point that Deputy McGrath is making in that there is a need for a new premises and there is only so much that refurbishment can do in the context of the facilities there at the moment.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	244	I cannot express enough how vital it is. The retired superintendent, Mr. John Courtney, the chief superintendent Catherine Kehoe and all the inspectors and officers need it. It is a terrible building that is totally unfit for purpose in every way. The only good thing about it is its location. It is located in the right place. However, An Garda Síochána does not own the building. It belongs to the county council. The move to the Army barracks is necessary for a number of reasons. Above all, it is primarily for An Garda Síochána and the public. We need to secure that new site. I would have thought that it would have been purchased from the county council at this stage because we need a modern district headquarters with all the different aspects. It would be lovely to have something like the equine unit placed there when we have a spacious site. I am pressing this issue on the Minister. I look forward to her visit at the earliest opportunity so she can see for herself. I accompanied the former Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan, there when he was the Minister, God rest him. It is so bad and so unfit for purpose. The gardaí, the lay staff and the public are all entitled to some modicum of a decent building for public service.

The estimated cost of the Clonmel station is some €7 million. In the meantime, there is some essential refurbishment and upgrading being considered at present, such as the cells. There is also a need for new changing areas as well. Those are interim proposals pending the development of the new headquarters. I can confirm that it is part of the public private partnership and once the issue of the site is finalised, it will probably take between 12 and 18 months before there is a new station there. We need to move ahead as quickly as possible. The key issue is to make sure that the site is available because we are committed to the public private partnership.

Discussions between the Home Secretary and myself focused on the ongoing co-operation between Ireland and the United Kingdom on criminal justice and security matters. These meetings form part of the regular engagement my Department has with our counterparts in the UK to support ongoing co-operation on these important issues.  As the Deputy knows, formal negotiations have not yet begun following the UK's decision to leave the EU. Any discussions with our UK counterparts will take full account of that, but there is a range of issues that is important for us to discuss. I want to continue the excellent co-operation. I highlighted how important it was, for example, that we had co-operation on the European arrest warrant and other EU justice and home affairs legal instruments. We need to continue the level of co-operation we have at present after the UK exits the EU. The precise mechanisms by which we will be able to do that are not clear at present, but I wanted to highlight how well that has worked. We do not want to go back to the old ways of doing it. We also spoke about the common travel area, its importance to the people of both Ireland and the UK and how vital it is in the context of Northern Ireland. When I was in London, I also had a separate meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, MP. Our discussion was very much focused on the common travel area, its importance in the context of the peace process and the need for all parties to re-engage in the political process in Northern Ireland. My meeting with the Home Secretary was very helpful, focusing primarily on the criminal justice issues. There is a huge amount of EU legislation and both Irish and UK legislation that will be impacted. My Department has been examining this over the last number of months. It has done very extensive work on examining the implications for this legislation given the Brexit context.

I acknowledge the ongoing co-operation that exists between her and the UK Home Secretary. The common travel area and the rights of Irish people north and south of the Border to free movement on the island of Ireland are hugely important. There has to be concern about the rights of Irish citizens that are living in the UK as well. I do accept that the mechanisms are not in place yet with regard to Brexit. However, from looking at the recent White Paper on Brexit from the UK Government, I would have some concerns. For example, the priority given to the strong and historic ties with Ireland and to maintaining the common travel area is a good thing. However, there is a contradiction where it specifically says "while protecting the integrity of the UK's immigration system". The UK pledge to maintain the travel area comes with a strong qualifier. It may even be a disqualifier.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	250	It has long been the case that as part of the common travel area arrangements, Ireland and the United Kingdom co-operate very closely on jointly securing the external border of the common travel area. We will continue to co-operate and strengthen that co-operation in the future. The common travel area has been in existence since Irish Independence. It allows freedom of travel between the two jurisdictions. It is a unique arrangement. It is extremely important that we get that across to other member states because Ireland remains an extremely committed member of the European Union. I met with Mr. Barnier to discuss that and to go into the detail of how it operates. We have a huge amount of co-operation and we do not see that changing. I welcome the publication of the British White Paper, which provides further details on the issues addressed by the Prime Minister in May. The Deputy raises a particular point about that speech. I would say that the analysis of the issues raised and the assessment of their potential implications for Ireland is continuing. I believe the specific section on Ireland-UK relations reflects the strong ties between our two countries; it is specifically noted.

With regard to another issue in the Brexit White Paper on controlling immigration, the language is very definitive in that it explicitly states: "We will have control over the number of EU nationals [Irish people are EU nationals] coming to the UK.". It further states: "In future, therefore, the Free Movement Directive will no longer apply and the migration of EU nationals [which we are] will be subject to UK law.". I believe those are conflicting priorities. I put it to the Tánaiste that given the interpretation the British Prime Minister puts on the Brexit referendum, it is a mandate to control immigration, as she has stated many times, and that the priority given to links with Ireland will play second fiddle to the commitment to limit EU immigration. That may have unintended devastating consequences for the people of Ireland, north and south of the Border.

They are about the common travel area and maintaining the peace process. We have had a variety of statements from UK Ministers highlighting how much they value the common travel area. Article 50 has not been triggered yet. There will be ongoing discussions on this issue but the commitment has been very clear. We will continue to prioritise and highlight in all our discussions the importance of the common travel area. I am reassured by my meetings with both the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that they both value and understand the importance of the common travel area to our two countries and our people.

A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to review the role of the National Disability Authority. This is a good opportunity to review the role and functions of the National Disability Authority and to consider whether changes are appropriate in the context of the changes in Irish society and the position of people with disabilities since its establishment in 1999. I am committed to ensuring that the review process will be open, objective and consultative and will be undertaken with participation by all relevant stakeholders, including the authority board and staff interests. As the Deputy will be aware, we are in the process of finalising a new national disability inclusion strategy and I believe it is appropriate that the review be undertaken in the context of the new strategy's priorities. The new strategy will be in place shortly, and I anticipate that we will then be able to commence the review of the authority, with the first step being to scope out terms of reference soon afterwards.

Was that included at his behest during the negotiations and, if so, why did he ask for it? I was talking to someone who works in the area of disabilities who said it would be interesting to find out the nature of this review and what it is trying to find out. The Minister of State might throw some light on that. The Minister of State also said that there is a good opportunity to review the role and functions of the National Disability Authority and to consider whether changes are appropriate in the context of the changes in Irish society and the position of people with disabilities since its establishment in 1999. Will the authority's role be enhanced with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? The Minister of State also mentioned undertaking the review in the context of a new national disability inclusion strategy. When will the strategy be published?

I worked very closely with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, during the negotiations on this issue because it is very important. We have very competent people in the NDA and I work very closely with them. In the past 12 months, I have also met over 4,000 stakeholders, including parents of children with disabilities, adults with disabilities, service providers and the broader disability community, and we will ensure that this will be a progressive and inclusive strategy. I accept the point that it has taken longer than everyone hoped it would take but as the Deputy will be aware, one of the reasons for the delay was the 2016 general election and the subsequent length of time it took to form a new Government. Work on the strategy was suspended during those months, and the lengthy consultation process was a further reason for the delay. However, I stand over the amount of time put aside for the process, which was extremely worthwhile and generated a significant number of suggestions, feedback and positive inputs which were incorporated into the strategy. I am determined that the strategy will be successful and implemented and that it will make a difference to the lives of people with a disability. This was a very important issue during the talks on a programme for Government.

I accept this was a very busy week for the Department of Justice and Equality but I do not believe it is the right home for it. I know that many who advocate for people with disabilities believe that the wider justice agenda means the Department is never fully focused on people with disability. With regard to the national disability inclusion strategy and the role of the NDA, does the Minister of State consider that another Department would be a better home? In our election manifesto, we included a pledge to create a Department of social protection and disability inclusion. The Minister of State also has a role in social protection and while I do not expect him to criticise the support he gets from the officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, the sheer scale of the other issues the Department must deal with, as happened this week, means that crucial work within the disability sector is being overlooked, although perhaps not intentionally. The Department of Justice and Equality has too many irons in the fire and I ask if it could be brought under the Department of Social Protection.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	First, I work very closely with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on this issue because as far as we are concerned, we have a vision to include people with disabilities in the broader equality agenda. Second, my job, as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, is to deal specifically with the issues the Deputy has raised.As the Deputy knows, it is referred to as a super junior. Of course, in an ideal world, I would prefer if it was a senior Ministry in its own right. We raised this during the talks. I accept the Deputy's point. The Deputy also mentioned that Fianna Fáil proposed a Minister for social protection and disability and I was very conscious of that at the time. Given the events this week work on the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been derailed. I was supposed to be in the House last week to bring in the particular Bill. I believe it will be back in the Chamber in the next two weeks. I will be listening to the suggestions made by Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and Jonathan O'Brien on disability and the issue of equality. That is the answer to the question. With regard to the UN convention, we are at a very advanced stage. There are number of technical and legal issues to be resolved. They are with the Office of the Attorney General. There are other smaller delays at the Department of Health. I am determined we will ratify the UN convention as quickly as possible.

They are Mark Kennedy, Jim Boyling, Mark Jenner and John Dines. I raised the need for the Irish Government to join the Scottish, German and Northern Irish Governments in seeking the extension of the Pitchford inquiry to include the operations of those undercover officers in this State. The Taoiseach said the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, would raise it with James Brokenshire last week and would issue a statement, which still has not been issued. Have we made any progress on this?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	The UK's undercover policing inquiry was established by the British Government in 2015 in order to investigate and to report on the undercover police operations conducted by English and Welsh police forces in England and Wales since 1968. It is chaired by Lord Justice Christopher Pitchford. That was a matter solely for the British Government in accordance with UK law. It is established under the UK Inquiries Act 2005, which does not provide powers for extraterritorial inquiry. The Deputy mentioned other countries. I understand they made representations seeking the extension of the inquiry's terms of reference but the UK Home Secretary, having considered those representations, decided that the terms of reference of the inquiry would not be so amended. Although in this context, the question of my seeking the extension of a UK inquiry does not arise, as I have indicated on several occasions, should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford inquiry that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required. The Deputy is correct that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Tuesday and, as part of their wider discussions, raised with him concerns that have been expressed in the House on matters relating to the Pitchford inquiry. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed to convey those concerns to the Home Secretary. Allegations regarding an undercover police officer in this jurisdiction were first brought to light in 2011. A report from the Garda Commissioner at that time noted that no evidence of any criminal activity by that person had been established. Of course, if there was any evidence, and if anybody has any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it should be brought to the attention of the Garda.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	Does it not concern that Tánaiste that four men were in this country operating as undercover British police agents? It has now been admitted, with an apology from the Met, that all of them had intimate relationships with women. One of them, Mark Kennedy, started a relationship with Sarah Hampton, who has written to the Minister repeatedly without getting responses. The Minister does not seem to want the extension of the inquiry. There is logical inconsistency in saying "should anything emerge from the findings of the Pitchford inquiry". Nothing will emerge about Ireland unless Ireland is included in the inquiry. Why does the Minister not request the extension? British police officers were operating undercover in this State. We do not really know whether they had the permission of the Government, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Garda. They were operating here. I know one of them was arrested. I know Mark Kennedy was here on multiple occasions. He was operating as an undercover police officer. How is it-----

The Home Secretary, having considered the representations, decided the terms of reference of the inquiry would not be amended. That is the first point, which is a really practical point on the UK approach to any extension of the terms of reference. The Deputy mentioned a particular person. Speaking generally, the Garda authorities are aware, of course, of allegations in respect of the presence here in the past of a person who has been the subject of media reports. A report from the Garda Commissioner on these allegations makes clear that no evidence has been established that the individual in question was involved in any criminal activity here in Ireland. Obviously, as I have said to the Deputy, and I do not know if this is what he is implying, but if there is any question of criminal activity clearly it should be brought forward. If the Deputy or anybody else has evidence of it, that should be brought to An Garda Síochána. That is the information I have on the point the Deputy has made.

If there is evidence of this, clearly it should be brought to the attention of An Garda Síochána. I would assume if it has there will be a file and an effort to investigate it if there is evidence to be pursued in the courts. Asking me whether I would have concern about a woman who has been raped, of course I would, whatever the context. Going back to the broader point the Deputy is making, and in a broader context than the particular point the Deputy has put on the record of the House, it is the advice of the Garda authorities that assistance from police services from other jurisdictions in intelligence gathering is a recognised and necessary tactic for managing circumstances where persons from outside the jurisdiction who are unknown to local police may seek to engage in criminal activity here, including a variety of activities which could be protests. This is entirely an operational matter for An Garda Síochána and it is carried out in accordance with its functions as set out in the Garda Síochána Acts. Neither I nor the Department have any involvement whatsoever in such arrangements. There is no question of anybody in that circumstance being permitted to engage in criminal activities. I hardly need to say that. Of course they would not in any circumstances.Any evidence of criminality would have to be pursued fully by the Garda authorities. There is no question of a police officer from outside the jurisdiction exercising police powers here.

Will she publish the report which is currently being compiled on the issue? Will the current report examine all 116 undercover operators and agents identified through the process in Britain, to see which ones operated in Ireland and which may have violated human rights here?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	The Commissioner’s report explained that the assistance of police officers from other jurisdictions in intelligence gathering may be a necessary tactic in the circumstances where external activists whose identities are unknown to local police seek to engage in certain activities that need to be investigated. The report also stated that the capacity of An Garda Síochána to enter into such arrangements was vital in the interests of national security and that the maintenance of confidentiality was an essential feature of any such arrangements. The clear view of the Garda authorities is that to disclose the details of any particular intelligence co-operation would impair the ability of An Garda Síochána to enter into such arrangements. I must, of course, have due regard to the views of the Garda Commissioner in respect of these operational policing matters. In light of developments which have taken place outside this jurisdiction since these matters first came to light, including the establishment by the UK Government of the Pitchford inquiry, I have requested a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have met at a senior level with their counterparts in the London Metropolitan Police Service in respect of this issue and will remain in ongoing contact with them. I will fully consider this report when it is available, including the issue of whether it may be suitable for publication. We have to think of the context of intelligence gathering and security and it may not be feasible to publish it.

She also asks: - Did you allow him to develop intimate relationships with women in your jurisdiction? - Was he operating with the full permission of the Irish authorities? - Do you have police files on me? - To what extent has my right to privacy been invaded by the Irish authorities?These are questions for the Minister for Justice and Equality but the Minister has refused to respond to her letters. I am not sure what the Minister is suggesting she should do. Has the Minister raised the case with her counterpart? She replied to a question earlier to the effect that she had met with the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, in the past week and she would seem to me to be the appropriate person to meet. I do not understand why it was being raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire. Will the Minister answer the letters Ms Hampton has written to her, including legal letters?

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	316	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I have discussed road safety already today with Deputy O'Callaghan. I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities and the consequences for everyone. The Deputy will be aware that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. Road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross. I am, however, informed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs, which will be known as preliminary drug tests. It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter bank holiday weekend. This will allow time for all stakeholders to prepare for introduction, and will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the bank holiday weekend. Until the 2016 Act is commenced, the Courts Service is not in a position to supply conviction statistics requested by the Deputy as there is no code for the offence of failing a roadside drug test.  I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety. Road safety is a shared responsibility, in society and across various Departments. We have to work together in partnership to highlight the dangers and educate the new generation of young men who are vulnerable at the moment, whether it is from drugs or alcohol. There are regular meetings involving me and departmental officials, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority to highlight the work being done. The recent campaign on alcohol and driving, which featured a brave family, was very effective but it will be interesting to see how public attitudes changes as the new drugs legislation is introduced. I have given details of the commencement of the provisions and there will be further co-operation with stakeholders.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	317	I welcome the fact that the legislation is being commenced during the Easter break, which is a time when people engage in different types of behaviour, sometimes excessively.A study undertaken by the County Kildare coroner showed that in 2014 over 1,300 samples from drivers were analysed for drugs, of which 58% tested positive. Some 52% were positive for two or more drugs. We have therefore seen a growth in poly-drug use that is beyond the scope of drug-related issues in this Act. Drug-related behaviour contributed to many traffic incidents but roadside testing was not intervening. It is, therefore, positive that the Road Safety Authority and the Department are commencing this testing at an appropriate time of year. The Road Safety Authority should ratchet up its own campaign to raise public awareness that it is commencing. It will deter people from engaging in reckless behaviour on the roads, such as consuming drugs before driving. I welcome the new information from Minister and hope that it will reduce road fatalities.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	318	An Garda Síochána has announced that there will be a 10% increase in the traffic corps in the course of this year, which should greatly help with enforcement. At the meeting I referred to, An Garda Síochána said it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore. This is important given that we are recruiting so many new gardaí. Section 29 of the Road Traffic Act is being reviewed with the intention of ensuring that all drivers caught while drink driving will in future receive a mandatory disqualification. I hope that the Deputy's party will support that measure when it is introduced before this House.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	320	Just a few days ago, in fact, I had a meeting with one of the Garda representative associations to discuss this important issue. The Government has made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. We are certainly not resiling from that commitment, as I assured the Garda representatives when I met them.  In December last, I went to Government and got approval for drafting the heads of a Bill to achieve this objective. Many different issues fall to be considered in this context. These include the status of the Garda associations established under the Garda Síochána Acts and the related question of constraints on members taking industrial action. To assist in the consideration of these, we have a new working group, which is chaired by Mr. John Murphy, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. They will have responsibility for the legislation. My Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Garda management and the Workplace Relations Commission are represented on the group. I have asked that group to meet at an early stage with the Garda associations, so that their submissions and views on this matter can be fully taken into account in the work that is going on. I want to have an effective structure to support harmonious industrial relations within An Garda Síochána and which are appropriate to the force. There are many key issues and if the Deputy would like to make a submission to that group I would welcome it. They are complex issues, including the critical one of how An Garda Síochána interacts with our society and what kind of limits there may or may not be concerning them in future.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	I am glad to know that the working group is up and running. It is important to consider how best members of An Garda Síochána can access industrial relations mechanisms. They should have that access. At the end of last year, we faced a difficult prospect for this country when strike action was threatened by a number of Garda associations. In fairness to them, they probably had to threaten that because they did not have access to the full industrial relations mechanism. However, it is a difficult and dangerous situation for the public if members of An Garda Síochána can go on strike. I remain of the view that section 59 of the Garda Síochána Act precludes members of An Garda Síochána from going on strike. There was much debate at the time as to whether that was so. In light of any ambiguity that may exist in respect of section 59, does the Tánaiste propose to bring forward legislation to expressly outlaw strikes in An Garda Síochána?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	322	This is an issue about which there was much concern and discussion given the events of last year. It is one of the many complex issues that will have to be considered carefully. It is critical that we have effective and robust mechanisms in place for industrial relations in An Garda Síochána. The question of a trade union is one of the key issues but there are a number of other issues we must consider. Trade union status gives rise not just to a series of protections for such organisations but also to a series of constraints. The task for the months ahead is to look carefully at what would be appropriate in a policing context. That is what the working group has been established to consider, given the changed status in regard to An Garda Síochána's access to the Workplace Relations Commission and to the Labour Court. I certainly want to have consultations. It is also a big societal issue; it is a broader issue than for An Garda Síochána alone. It is a crucial issue in terms of the safety and protection of our society.

However, when it comes to certain institutions and certain State employees there must be a question mark over that. I would certainly limit that to An Garda Síochána and judges. The former is responsible for the protection of the State, while the latter group is responsible for the administration of justice. This will all be considered in Mr. Murphy's report to which the Tánaiste has referred, particularly in respect of gardaí. It is important that the State adopts a position in respect of it. My understanding of the law at present is that gardaí cannot go on strike. If there is any ambiguity about that we need to bring it back to this House so that the elected representatives can make a decision on whether they wish to put specific laws in place to deal with the matter. I want to know when we can expect to have that report.

We must have this legislation in place by the end of the year, so this might be something for the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to consider. I totally agree with the Deputy that this is a topic for consideration by the entire House. We certainly need to get the views of everyone on it. It is a central issue. People were extraordinarily upset, understandably, at the prospect of that withdrawal of service. We saw how serious the situation was and the huge consequences that would have arisen if that had gone ahead. The working group will report by 31 May.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	329	I thank the Deputy for his question. I think I have put this on the record before. I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are currently some 178 stations that are not connected to the Garda network.Members in non-networked locations can contact the Garda information services centre 24 hours a day to log an incident or access information from the PULSE system if required. As such, while those stations do not have direct access, they have an alternative in the 24-hour provision. We have to move ahead and prioritise technology projects in An Garda Síochána. I brought the first working group together between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána to look at Garda IT requirements and we are now investing approximately €300 million in this area. We have to introduce mobile technology solutions to allow operational gardaí to access core information including PULSE while on duty and away from Garda stations. Providing members with real-time information and mobile devices, as well as enabling investigation teams to collect and share information digitally, will improve the effectiveness of the service provided to communities. The network will be expanded throughout 2017 to ensure that additional stations gain access to the relevant systems. Garda information systems such as PULSE will also be modernised to ensure that members have quick access to timely and accurate information. The Government is certainly supporting them. When I had the working group in place, there was a commitment of over €205 million and that has been added to. I have asked the Garda Commissioner for the specific information requested by the Deputy and will revert to him when it is to hand.

That is now down to 178, meaning that a handful of stations have been connected in recent weeks. The Minister will say that this is an operational issue for An Garda Síochána, but the modernisation and renewal programme for the period 2016 to 2021 that is being rolled out by the force focuses more on rural stations which are not connected. The priority is to get those connected to the system through mobile technology. However, that is not always the case. In my county of Cork, over one third of stations are not yet connected to the PULSE system. As the Minister said, a great deal of funding has been invested in this area. Does she have any set figures on the number of stations she would like to see covered in 2017? How quickly will the roll-out of the new modernisation and renewal programme take place?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	It is essential that we get to the point where gardaí have access not only to PULSE but to broader mobile technology solutions. It is essential. I have seen in other countries how police can access a whole range of information on their mobile phones. We must get to that point here. I knew when I became Minister that we needed this new investment. That is there and the issue is one of the priorities for the coming year. It is a priority under the Garda Síochána modernisation and renewal programme to which the Deputy referred as it must be because that is the shape of effective 21st century policing. Our gardaí must have access to the information they need in a speedy and efficient way. I will try to get a detailed note on this for the Deputy and communicate directly with him as to the precise plans for the roll-out in 2017. I agree with him that this has to be a priority area. It has been identified. I am very happy to share with him the precise detail of what is happening. I will ask the Garda Commissioner for a report on the progress being made and the targets for the next year.

We are in a ten-year cycle now and, as such, what plans does the Department have to review the legislation?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	335	GSOC is a very important body and Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring is the chairperson. I thank her and the other commissioners for their work. It is very important that we have confidence in its work and that An Garda Síochána has confidence in it too. That means the public will have confidence as they need to know that very important role is being carried out effectively and efficiently. We have increased the resources provided to GSOC in recent times. I am sure the Deputy was at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality when the chairperson of GSOC appeared before it last year. In general terms, she called for changes to Part 4 of the Garda Síochána Act which deals with the investigation of complaints in order, as she saw it, to allow GSOC to function more effectively. She also referred to minor service issues she felt should be managed by Garda line management rather than by GSOC. I agree with her very strongly on that. We ought to find a mechanism to ensure that it can happen. She also sought changes to the powers of GSOC to require the Garda Commissioner to provide it with information and documents in the context of investigations. From the information we have at present, the rate of response on the part of the Garda to requests from GSOC has improved considerably in terms of the time limits outlined as necessary and put in place. We should be able to find a mechanism to deal with the more minor issues which are taking up so much of the time of police around the country. There is definitely a better way to do it. That is precisely what I want to examine. It may be necessary legislate for it. When I met Ms Justice Ring and her team, I said I would review the legislation. GSOC has been there for ten years now. That review will be done very quickly by the Department. I have given that commitment to the judge. It is important to review and strengthen the legislation to deal with the issues the judge identified. On foot of the work she is doing, she is in a position to identify them first hand and she has made a submission to me in that regard.

As the Minister says, the chairperson appeared before the committee in October. While I would not say she was very critical of Part 4, she certainly said it needed to be enhanced to improve the functions of GSOC. She also talked about the Garda Commissioner. One area to which she did not refer but which should be part of the review is the civilian staff seconded to An Garda Síochána. I do not know if that is possible. To the best of my knowledge, they are not covered by GSOC. If we are looking at the force as a whole, we need to consider the civilian staff who also work within An Garda Síochána. That may be something we could consider as part of the review to identify a legislative provision which brings them within the remit of GSOC.

I only met the judge a few weeks ago. However, it can be done in the short term and we can consider the various issues the Deputy raises. The legislation will go to pre-legislative scrutiny. I intend to take on board the various points the judge has made and which the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality discussed with her. I want to identify how we can move ahead effectively. Of course, I will have to have a consultation process with the other stakeholders.

I accepted an amendment because I thought it would a very useful power for the Irish Human Rights and Quality Commission to possess. In conversations with the chair of the body, she confirmed that it is very useful legislation. The then Senator and now Minister, Deputy Zappone, introduced the amendment. My Department undertook a consultation process on the development of a new statement of strategy, with a deadline of September 2016 for receipt of submissions. It was published on 14 February and its contents reflect the positive duty obligation. It provides a great opportunity for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Department. One can view the new women's strategy in that context. There is engagement with the community. I have attended some of the consultations on the development of the new women's strategy. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, also has responsibility in this area and has pursued a number of initiatives in respect of disability.

Last week we launched the integration strategy which has been widely welcomed by groups working on integration around the country. It is important that we have a strong integration policy because if we do not we will build up problems for the future. It is a very comprehensive integration strategy. I mentioned the women's consultation, which has been ongoing. There are a number of other initiatives relating to combating domestic and gender-based violence. The Deputy will be familiar with the campaign I have spoken about in the House. It is a €6 million campaign over five years to combat sexual and domestic violence. That comes under the Deputy's points on a positive duty to promote equality and deal with areas where there are very serious problems in Ireland.

We need to make sure that An Garda Síochána is resourced in a way that enables it to conduct effective policing in line with the best policing methods. As the Deputy said, that includes more resources. In his question the Deputy has described what he thinks is needed. There needs to be better use of mobile technology. We have put funding in place in order to make sure that happens. Over €205 million was agreed as a result of the working group. Significant resources have been made available. The Garda Commissioner is the person, in accordance with section 26 of the Garda Síochána Act, responsible for that.  The Deputy mentioned policing developments in other jurisdictions, including benefits arising from increased use of the types of vehicles he described. Similar developments here have become possible because of the tens of millions of euro we have invested over the past two or three years. The money was badly needed because investment in An Garda Síochána could not resume until the economy began to recover. I assure the Deputy that we intend to ensure that we provide resources to the Garda so we can continue investment in the fleet, not just for traditional vehicles but also those that are suitable for the kind of work they are now doing throughout the country, including on motorways.

I refer to the extent to which the use of modern transport such as quad bikes and mopeds can be encouraged in urban and rural areas in order, as has happened in other jurisdictions, to enhance activity and mobility.

The investment we have provided so far has been used to provide the Garda with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars and motorcycles to ensure they can be mobile, visible and responsive. Some €46 million has been allocated under our capital plan for the Garda fleet for the next number of years. We have also invested tens of millions of euro in the Garda fleet in recent years. That has been acknowledged around the country and has made a difference to the ability of gardaí to respond more efficiently and effectively in local areas. No more than the discussion around mobile technology and the need to move to modern policing methods, it is an essential part of where An Garda Síochána has to go if we are to provide effective and responsive policing.

It was not for the fun of it; rather, it was to ensure that their employer would honour the workers' terms and conditions.In this day and age it is an absolute disgrace that they would have to do so and that proper workers' rights are not enshrined in legislation to protect them and their terms and conditions. On Tuesday morning I attended in solidarity with the workers in Ballyfermot and will do so as the strike continues. Tesco's action in its assault on the terms and conditions of these workers and its union-busting attitude is reminiscent of the actions of William Martin Murphy and his ilk and is a continuation of a move by many employers in a race to the bottom in terms of wages and terms and conditions which we have seen for decades and which the State has not prevented. It is the State's job to protect workers' rights. I call on the State to step in and prevent companies, especially those as profitable as Tesco, which is one of the most profitable retailers in Ireland, from slashing wages. For it to attack and assault workers' rights is disgraceful, especially when we consider that many of those who work for Tesco end up dependent on the State for a top up. This is a move that other retailers and companies are doing more frequently to ensure that workers are dependent on the State rather than the company. These people have worked and provided the companies' profits and the only answer the companies have, in particular Tesco, is to attack the terms and conditions of the workers.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	352	Today I had a call from a Tesco worker who is not a pre-1996 worker but who stands four square behind her colleagues. She knows that she will be next if she does not stand behind them. She recounted what has happened to her since expressing her support. Her management has called her in on several occasions and told her not to support her fellow colleagues - her neighbours and her friends. She explained that these are the very people who taught her everything she knows in the job. They gave her the benefit of their life experience and have always been hugely supportive. She is witnessing them being bullied and pushed around to the point that stress and intimidation has already forced a number of them out. If the Minister does not call out this company and confirm to it that it will not be allowed to get away with changing contracts of employment without agreement, in effect the Government is undermining decent jobs and conditions. Everyone's job conditions are at stake. Those wages and conditions, which were fought for, allowed Tesco to become one of the most successful multinationals operating on this island. I have no doubt that Tesco management forced this strike. It wants the unions silenced so that it can pursue a race to the bottom. It is a fact that 900 full-time jobs were done away with last year in this hugely profitable company and not one of them was replaced with a full-time contract. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, 10% of Tesco workers are receiving social welfare payments. Will we allow it to get away with this so that, perhaps, half the wages are funded out of it? The right to a decent job with decent pay and conditions must be our starting point. If we do not defend it here in Tesco, it will spread. That is unacceptable in modern Ireland.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	353	I met the Tesco workers in Tullamore and stood in solidarity with them on the picket line. It is appalling that long-term Tesco workers are being told to accept unacceptable and imposed changes to their contracts or to get out the door. The new contracts would result in some workers experiencing reduced incomes of up to 15% along with increased use of undecided hours. Already 10% of Tesco staff are so low paid that the State has to top up their incomes with supplementary welfare. This is despite the fact the company makes profits of millions and much more than any other retailer in Ireland. The wider issue is that there is real fear among union members that this is an attempt by Tesco to undermine trade union membership, as we have seen with other retailers, and it needs to be stopped. It has been reported that Tesco has written to staff to encourage them to leave their union as part of Project Black. This is seen by many within the trade union movement as a clear attempt by Tesco to undermine further the terms and conditions of staff in order to increase its already large profits. It is a disgrace. This Government needs to stand with the workers and it needs to act to ensure that trade union membership is protected at all times. It needs to stand up to corporations that are exploiting workers in the State.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	354	The situation in Tesco should be alarming to anyone concerned with decent work in this country, particularly Government. Over recent months, 900 full-time permanent jobs in a hugely profitable company have been lost. Not one full-time job has replaced them. Instead Tesco is now going after the remaining 250 workers on these decent contracts and trying to force them out the door. The company states that it has offered workers voluntary redundancy, but what kind of choice is it when they are told their terms and conditions will be torn up if they stay on. In reality, this is part of a long-term plan in Tesco to break their union. Earlier this month in the Dáil, I spoke about Project Black. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation heard me speak about it. It is a plan drawn up by a union-busting legal firm, Eversheds, which was also employed by Ryanair when it set up its company. We now know that there is also Project Purple. The company initially stated that there was no such thing as Project Black. Then it admitted there was but, in admitting it, it stated there also was Project Purple. The staff are wondering what the hell is Project Purple, which appears to be coming down the line. The plan is to convert an entire workforce of 11,000 jobs to part-time, low-paid and precarious work. This matches what we are seeing across the economy, which is the growth of low pay Ireland. Jobs in companies such as Tesco that once offered workers enough security to plan their lives and enough pay to support a family are being replaced with ones that will never be able to meet the cost of living. The most recent OECD statistics show that Ireland is second in the developed world for low-paid jobs - it is one in four jobs. Is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation prepared to stand over this kind of economy? If not, why is she not intervening and telling Tesco not to bully its workers in the way it has in recent weeks? Will she state today that a company that made €250 million in profit here last year should not unilaterally change the terms and conditions of the workers who made that possible?

We have heard from other Deputies about a company that makes €250 million profit in this country each year attempting to cut workers' pay by 20% by tearing up agreements. However, this is my question for the Minister. This major multinational retail outlet is organising a wholesale union-busting campaign right under the Minister's nose. Look at what it is doing: it is banning union business from the staff canteens, banning union information from the staff notice boards, banning union officials from going on the premises and encouraging staff to leave the union and now we know it is ending the check-off of union subscriptions from workers' wages. This is a classic American-style union-busting campaign. Deputy Joan Collins told the Minister its name: Project Black. The Minister is responsible for jobs and employment and this is taking place under her nose. When she stands to speak, will she please inform the House and the Tesco workers and their supporters in the Visitors Gallery what she will do to stop and outlaw this union-busting campaign taking place under her very nose?

I have no direct role in the resolution of this dispute or similar disputes. I understand the dispute at Tesco relates to proposed changes to pre-1996 employee contracts for approximately 250 of the 14,500 staff employed at Tesco. In a circumstance such as this, I would always advise and encourage parties to use the offices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Labour Court, as the parties have done on this occasion. An extensive process of engagement and negotiation culminated in August 2016 in the Workplace Relations Commission making proposals for resolution of the issues at the request of the parties. These proposals were accepted by Tesco but rejected by the trade union side. The matter was subsequently referred to the Labour Court. In November 2016, the Labour Court recommended that the parties should, over a period of eight weeks, engage in a locally based process in an attempt to allow settlement at local store level. The court recommended that the process should be guided generally by the content of the WRC proposals. If this did not succeed, the Labour Court recommended that the WRC proposals should then be accepted as the means of national resolution of the issues. Tesco accepted the Labour Court recommendation, while Mandate rejected it and did not engage in the local process. After balloting its members, Mandate served strike notice and industrial action commenced on Tuesday last at eight stores. Industrial action will commence at eight more stores tomorrow and staff at a further 23 stores will be balloted from Monday next. This is disappointing given the efforts of the Workplace Relations Commission and Labour Court. I welcome the announcement at lunchtime today that both parties have agreed to talks. I hope these talks will result in a resolution acceptable to all sides.

The Minister stated she did not have a role in the matter. On the contrary, as a legislator she can change the law to protect workers. I urge her and other Ministers to support the Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill when it comes before the House on Second Stage next week. I request also that the Minister ask her colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to issue a statement clarifying that family income supplement payments to striking workers will not be affected while they are in dispute as Tesco management has been threatening striking staff with such a fall-out from their action.

Against that backdrop, it is critical that the Government intervenes to put manners on an employer that has been out of control in this dispute. While I accept that the issues were before the industrial relations machinery of the State, the Labour Court recommendation was rejected not by Mandate but by trade union members and workers participating in a democratic process. It is the right of workers under legislation and in collective agreements to defend their contracts of employment. Will the Minister direct Tesco that it is unlawful to change a person's contract of employment without his or her agreement given that the company has not secured such agreement?

Sinn Féin has consistently stood with workers. We have introduced a number of Bills, for example, the Banded Hours Contract Bill, to address key issues of concerns but we have been thwarted at every turn by the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties. I commend Deputy David Cullinane who will introduce legislation on this issue next week. The Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill proposes to place the right of access to trade union membership on a statutory footing. It will also protect the right of workers to engage with a trade union in line with a measure in operation in New Zealand. I encourage all Deputies to support the Bill when Second Stage is taken next week. We must put a stop, once and for all, to the race to the bottom and protect ordinary workers who work hard and are the backbone of the economy.

He and his colleagues, he continues, want to do a day's work and get on with their lives without a threat hanging over them. If the company gets workers on pre-1996 contracts, he warns, others must watch their backs because they will be next. I reiterate the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. Under current legislation, a worker's contract cannot be changed without agreement. Tesco workers rejected the Labour Court recommendation because it did not clarify many of their concerns and questions. The Minister must tell Tesco to stop using the tactics it has employed. It is breaking the law and should be told it cannot behave in this manner in Ireland. It should also be told to withdraw the threats it has made and negotiate again with workers.

In response, she read a script which did not answer my question. I will repeat my question and in doing so I ask the Minister to answer it when she replies again. What measures is she prepared to take and what legislation does she intend to bring before the House to prevent union-busting of this type? Many Tesco workers are in receipt of family income supplement as a result of the low wages paid by the company. As the jostling in the Fine Gael Party continues to see who will be its next leader and the next Taoiseach, the name of the Minister for Social Protection, who has responsibility for family income supplement, is in lights at the moment. Is the Minister prepared to state that she will call clearly and cleanly on the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that the family income supplement payment of not one worker will be affected while he or she is on strike? The company would like it to be affected to break and undermine the strike.

We have industrial relations machinery available to both parties, namely, the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission. The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There has been a consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers and employers' associations and trade unions or staff associations. This approach has served us well over the years. In general, our laws do not try to impose on parties to a trade dispute. Rather, they are designed to help support parties in resolving their differences. The State has, by and large, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Our industrial relations institutions have been heavily involved in this dispute and the Workplace Relations Commission and Labour Court have put forward independent proposals and recommendations and will keep a close watch. I hope the Deputies will join me in encouraging both sides to make every effort to reach a resolution.It is reported on the RTE website that Mandate and Tesco have agreed to talks in a bid to resolve this row. My understanding is that no date has yet been agreed.

The Minister will be aware that a decision has been taken to withdraw counselling grants to primary schools in particular. I received a letter from a principal of one of the schools in my constituency, some of the content of which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister. The opening paragraph states that he has received correspondence from Tusla informing him that the counselling grants scheme is to be closed. It continues as follows:I wish to object most strenuously to this development and to request that this decision be revoked. The Counselling grant enabled us [the school] to provide support to some of the most vulnerable children in our school, helping them through the considerable distress they are enduring and to deal with trauma in their lives. This support is now to be withdrawn without consideration for those benefiting from Counselling or without the offer of any alternative. This is regressive and will directly impact on those who could most benefit from support.In the interests of vulnerable children, I urge that this decision be rescinded and that the Counselling Grant be immediately restored.Neither I nor anybody else could make a stronger case than the person who is dealing with this issue at the coalface, who knows the state of minds of these children, their backgrounds and all of the social deprivation issues that they endure. I am aware that Tusla has indicated that money will be redirected through some other programme but that is not enough to convince the person who is dealing with this issue at the coalface. If I have learned anything from my time as a public representative it is that it is important to speak to the people on the ground, those who are affected by decisions that are taken here and in Departments and State agencies. Often what looks good on paper or sounds good in theory in practice does not work. I put it to the Minister that the statement of the school principal is a clear indication that the theory behind the reallocation of this funding is not in the best interests of the children and, therefore, it will not have a positive outcome for the children we all seek to assist and protect to the greatest extent possible. Will the Minister consider reinstating the grant, recognising the role that principals play? The service provided is a tried and trusted practice at this stage. In the past special needs assistant allocations were based on quotas and school numbers and so on. It became blatantly obvious at a later stage that the input of the school principal was most important in that regard and we moved towards that. It seems to me that the decision is being taken to withdraw this grant, remove the principal from the mix and move to a paper-based assessment or at a remove from the coalface. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this decision and to give whatever direction is required to Tusla to reinstate these grants and to put the school principal back in the centre in terms of the allocation of the assistance to these vulnerable children.

I am concerned about the impact of the decision to close the school counselling grants scheme. Like the Deputy, I have met school principals in my constituency on this matter. They have communicated very clearly the importance of these grants for the welfare of the children in their schools, using language and expression similar to that used by the principal from whom the Deputy received correspondence. I am meeting Tusla early next week to examine this matter further. First, I would like to outline the rationale I have received from Tusla for closing the scheme. I have been advised by Tusla education and welfare service, EWS, that the grant scheme which was originally established in 1994 by the then Department of Social Welfare was to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss. This scheme was closed in 2011 while under the remit of the then Family Support Agency due to budget cuts and no new applicants have been accepted since this time. Only those grantees in 2011 receiving funding continued to do so. The scheme came under the remit of Tusla in 2014. This counselling grants scheme is for a total of €245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefiting from it. With more than 4,000 schools in Ireland, 64 grantees means less than 2% of schools were in receipt of support from this scheme while it remained closed to all other schools. The necessity for bereavement and loss counselling still exists in schools throughout the country. Tusla was of the view that it was unfair and unethical to continue providing support to a small number of areas while excluding all other schools from the scheme. Thus, the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format. Following on from this decision Tusla EWS informed grantees in January 2016, and as part of the 2016-2017 grant application process reconfirmed, that the scheme would not operate for 2017-2018. The EWS wrote again to confirm this in January 2017. In this context it is important to note that each school completion programme can utilise up to €5,000 of their funding for counselling. To ensure continued counselling support to children, Tusla provides child counselling through the agency’s family support services funding. In 2016, funding solely for child counselling was increased under this scheme to €680,000. In particular, child counselling funding to approximately 70 family resource centres throughout Ireland was increased to €242,000. The agency is the main funder of Barnardos children’s bereavement service which works to support children and families coping with death. This includes a bereavement telephone helpline and a highly skilled therapeutic service that supports children, particularly in relation to complicated grief and traumatic loss. The funding was increased by €20,000 in 2016, with total funding to the service now €154,600. The agency is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation-divorce or a death. The Rainbows programme is delivered in more than 250 schools and community-based centres throughout the country. Funding in 2016 was increased by €15,000 to €250,000 annually. I know that Tusla is keen to ensure counselling services are available to all children who need them. I intend to seek reassurances from it that this decision does not have an unforeseen and unintended impact.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	367	I welcome that the Minister is aware of the problem and that she recognises the potential impact on the children affected. I also welcome her indication that she intends to discuss the matter with Tusla. However, what I would like, although I accept it may not be possible, is an assurance from the Minister that she will do all in her power to have the grant reinstated. I understand the necessity for fairness and equity but as in the case of any budget item, schools that have become dependent on that grant are not in a position to draw resources from other areas. I am sure there are schools that have made their own provisions through fund-raising and other activities or are able to raise funds to provide third party support. However, generally speaking the schools that will be affected by this decision are schools serving disadvantaged areas where their capacity to fund-raise is limited. Although the programme started in 1994, 23 years ago, the nature and complexity of the challenges facing children from disturbed backgrounds have changed significantly. Bereavement and loss may have been the action items that needed addressing at that time, but now there is a proliferation of drugs and various complexities associated with the make-up of families. Very significant issues evolve and change. The need for counselling has increased rather than decreased. I refer to the multifaceted and complex circumstances in which children find themselves. For that reason, I do not buy Tusla's notion that in order to be equitable and fair, it is better to take from those who have rather than giving to all. While I understand this somewhat perverse or reverse logic, I do not accept it, nor should the Minister or House. I appeal to the Minister to reiterate in her discussions with Tusla the importance of supporting those who have become dependent on the funding and who expected it.

The Deputy spoke eloquently about recognising the role of principals. It is very important that that perspective be part of the mix. I would like to assure the Deputy that the grant will be reinstated given my background, approach and conversations in my constituency. The Deputy might give me a little time in that regard, although I do not believe I can say anything until I have actually spoken to Tusla and explored this matter with it. In light of the Deputy's question, for which I am grateful, I have reflected on what the grant is for. One can hear in the response that it was originally and largely for supporting children in counselling on foot of bereavement, trauma and loss. I will be asking in my conversation with Tusla whether this history is fully understood. Perhaps some of the confusion or questions principals are asking may be coming from the fact that it is perceived that the grant has become part of a school completion programme. Why not because it is in the education welfare services of Tusla, implying it is especially for children living in contexts of disadvantage and all that can mean. A principal to whom I spoke referred to children experiencing hunger, trauma, addiction, self-harm and the potential to take their life by suicide, or, effectively the stress of living below the poverty line. The question arises as to whether there are other counselling services in the area that they can access. There are not in my constituency. Should the grants be available to all schools? On this question, I take the Deputy's point. It depends on what they are for. I know that schools in my constituency actually spend more than the counselling moneys they receive on counselling services. That provides some evidence and a perspective that I will bring to my conversations with Tusla.

Tipperary town, which has five primary schools, has suffered from much social deprivation over a number of years. There is serious unemployment there and much social housing and social issues. The criteria that must be met for a school to obtain DEIS status would seem to be tailor-made for Tipperary town. We had a public meeting in November which the five Deputies and other local representatives attended. The five schools came together and put the information forward on the problems in their town. They gave the numbers of underprivileged children attending, including foreign nationals and Travellers. All the criteria seemed to fit perfectly for acquiring DEIS status. We were very surprised and disappointed when the announcement was made earlier in the week that none of the five schools in the town got DEIS status. The town has suffered many blows and it would be a major advancement for the educational infrastructure if DEIS status were given to the schools.

They are St. Joseph's girls national school, St. Michael's girls national school, St. Michael's junior boys school, Gaelscoil Thiobraid Árann and the Monastery boys school. These were left out of the 2005 designation as well. Tipperary town is a designated RAPID town and has high levels of unemployment. The aggregate statistics for the schools are as follows: households headed by lone parents, 24.2%; households in which English is not the first language, 20%; low income households, 44.2%; students with special needs, 17.4%; students receiving learning support, 35%. These statistics appear to be tailor-made for meriting DEIS status for the schools. I ask the Minister to review the decision and designate the schools.

The schools were left out in 2005, which is many years ago. The schools are at a complete loss to understand why. By any measure, the schools are in areas of high deprivation and have a strong case for inclusion. The Minister will be aware that the south-east region is the second most disadvantaged in Ireland, and Tipperary is the third most disadvantaged local authority area within the region. The schools I am referring to presented persuasive and compelling reasons for inclusion in the DEIS plan, which is to begin in September 2017. What they were up against, however, was a deeply flawed model in terms of criteria used to assess schools. The Department itself has acknowledged that the methodology used in the assessments is deeply inadequate and in need of improvement. It is disgraceful that these schools were excluded from receiving vital allocations because they failed to meet poorly formulated departmental criteria. I am challenging the Minister. He snubbed Carrick-on-Suir quite recently on the opening day - a massive, great day for the town. It is another snub to Tipperary town and, indeed, Holy Trinity national school, Fethard. I ask the Minister to get things in order in his Department, have a proper assessment system and have the proper criteria adhered to.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23349	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	The truth is that this system was set up based on an objective assessment. It has taken into consideration issues such as the ones the Deputies raised, including social class, dependency ratios, educational levels of parents, lone parenthood, overcrowding, occupation, unemployment. On this first round, I have been able to include just 2% of schools in addition in the DEIS scheme. That is a small number, amounting to 79 schools, but they are the schools of the highest concentration identified by the method. It is a fair and objective method and the Department defends it fully and has implemented it. The programme has introduced improvements. Tipperary, as Deputies know, has five of the 79 additional schools. Two are in urban band 1, one is in urban band 2 moving to urban band 1, and three are in the rural band. Out of the fewer than 80 schools, which is about two per constituency, Tipperary has five. Therefore, this is not an anti-Tipperary model by any means. I fully recognise that we need to do more work. We are going to refine the methodology and examine the way in which schools use resources and how we can best deploy resources. I hope that in the future it will be possible to give consideration to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools because I recognise that beyond these schools which are shown to have the highest concentration of disadvantage, there are others that have significant concentration.The scheme's purpose is to move to a situation where we use our available resources to best support children who come to school with particular disadvantages and ensure they fulfil their potential. Deputy Seamus Healy raised the important issues of special educational needs and learning support. Separate from DEIS, I recently announced a new model of resource teacher allocation. It will involve 900 additional resource teachers next year who will be allocated in a way that better meets the needs of children with learning support and special educational needs and foreign nationals. The resources will go to where there is the greatest need. As regards foreign nationals and Travellers, the matter raised by Deputy Jackie Cahill, there are individual schemes that support children with special needs because of the nationalities of their parents. If a school believes it has a particular difficulty, it can apply in respect of the learning needs of children for whom English or Irish is not the spoken language in the home. This is the first step in seeking to put more resources into disadvantaged areas, just as we are putting more resources into special education, and tailoring that approach to the best advantage of children in order that they can progress successfully and fulfil their potential in the education system. It is one of the core goals of our education strategy to improve the way in which we support children with a disadvantage. Although the schools the Deputies have mentioned are not included, five schools in County Tipperary are receiving this advantage and I hope to be able to extend that number. I guarantee that I will set this as a priority and ensure our resources are deployed to best effect in all of the schools we support.

Its community feels let down. Will the Minister commit to reviewing the five primary schools in the town? In any examination of the criteria they would qualify for DEIS status. Their principals are perplexed to understand how they failed. They took a co-ordinated approach because the problems in Tipperary town crossed the five schools. It is 2005 since our schools were last accepted into the DEIS programme. That is an unacceptable length of time for these schools to wait to acquire DEIS status. The town has suffered many blows during the years owing to unemployment and its people feel as if they are being let down and left behind.

It is impossible for people on the ground who know it and know its school system - Oireachtas Members, teachers and parents - to believe these schools have not gained DEIS status. Will the Minister agree to review the decision? Crucially, will he agree to meet a deputation of the schools' principals and Oireachtas Members to review the situation and ensure Tipperary town's schools are included in the DEIS programme? The statistics I have supplied are real. There is real deprivation and unemployment in Tipperary town. The students in the schools require, and are entitled to have, DEIS status.

Thanks to the Department's decision, children in Tipperary town must continue to suffer unacceptable levels of educational deprivation. They are to be denied the extra assistance that comes with DEIS status, for example, school breakfast and literacy programmes. They live in areas with the highest level of concentrated disadvantage and will never receive further help because, in the words of a departmental official, a significant social and demographic change would have to be observed before a reassessment would be considered. However, that is already the situation, as the statistics show. In plain language, this means that the Department knows that the children are poor and deprived, but they will have to wait until they are even deeper in poverty and deprivation before it can help. That is ridiculous. It is 12 years since the last review, which is unacceptable. Will the Minister commit to directing his departmental staff to change the criteria? If we could not meet them, something is wrong with them. The Minister most certainly snubbed the people of Carrick-on-Suir. Tipperary was good to him. He came down and got a bean chéile, with which we are delighted. The people and children of Carrick-on-Suir deserve better than what they have received. This is at the other end of south Tipperary. What the Department has done is shameful.

We have on this occasion been able to increase the number of schools in the disadvantaged programme by 2%. The criteria I cited are the ones that are used and that the Deputies cited. They relate to unemployment rates, social class, occupation, overcrowding of children, lone parents, the education levels of parents, dependency ratios and population decline. These are objective measures which are applied to every school in the same way. Tipperary's need has been recognised. Two additional schools in Carrick-on-Suir have received special DEIS status. We envisage that some schools that have not been included this time have a case to make, but we have only been able to include those in the areas with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. However, I hope to be in a position to look afresh at the matter in the future. To respond to Deputy Jacie Cahill, any school can seek a review of how the process has been applied in its case, but the same criteria apply. Deputy Seamus Healy referred to high levels of learning support and special educational needs. The service is allocated not through the DEIS programme but through resource teacher allocations. I have reformed that system in order that, from next September, it will be done in a fairer way, with resource following the need in a school. The 900 additional teachers will go to the schools with the greatest levels of need. This is a beneficial change. We will see progressive improvement in the way resources follow the children with the greatest learning support and special educational needs. This is the start, not the end, of a journey.

While many are mentioned in the report, the committee secretariat needs a special mention because of the long hours its staff put into the research and presentation of the report. They were professional in their approach. Arising from the 2016 general election and the general knowledge of insurance prior to that, committee members believed this topic was an important one that affected the economic growth and prosperity of the country. It affects every citizen and business. We need to do something about the rising cost of premiums for motor insurance and, as we found during our hearings, public liability, employers' liability insurance and so on.We did go beyond the groups affected by motor insurance and we invited the Licensed Vintners Association and the Dublin publicans to give us their perspective on what they see as a huge threat to their business. Therefore, while we are talking about the motor insurance business it is the claims and the process leading to those claims for both motor insurance and other insurance that are driving up insurance premia. Over a three year period it was found by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that insurance costs increased by 70%. Speaking to the report and knowing the content of the Minister of State's report and following our recent exchanges with him our efforts in this area will be judged on the outcomes by those who are paying the premia. Those who are being ripped off by insurance companies and have to pay the premia will not thank us if we do not immediately implement the recommendations put before us today in the committee's report, and over a shorter period than envisaged by the Minister of State. There are 71 recommendations. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the good exchange we had and the information they supplied us with that fed into the outcomes in the report. It was clear during the course of those hearings that Insurance Ireland was not giving the full range of information it collects. Insurance Ireland makes available information to the Central Bank on the basis of the requests from the bank about the information required rather than the full extent of the information it holds. In the course of the hearings, the one issue that arose was the conflict between every single stakeholder and the lack of information. It is that lack of information that is causing a narrowing of the market to the few players we now have because when those who are outside the country seek to determine whether they will participate the only information they can get is through Insurance Ireland, and they pay dearly for it through an agent. That is what came out in the hearings. The book of quantum, which is now updated but was not updated for some time, is a key factor in the debate because it informs the market and those outside of this country looking at the market as to what the potential claims might be. What we discovered was, for example, the significant difference between what is paid for whiplash in Ireland compared to the UK. As we said to the Minister of State this morning, there is a need to analyse the full extent of the awards made by the Court of Appeal and the other courts feeding into that so that the book of quantum can be an extensive analysis of the awards that are being paid out. Let us compare that then to the UK, Northern Ireland and other European Union jurisdictions so the judicial system can be informed of the amounts of money we are talking about. One of the main players is the judicial system and the awards process. While we recognise the separation of powers between this House and the judicial system it is only fair that we would say to judges that they should analyse the information that will be given to them in the context of the book of quantum. That would help them to be roundly informed of the issue. Following this debate I hope they will hear the concern Members have about the threat to the economy by way of the increases in insurance premia. The examples we have relate to the various components of the SME sector which told us that insurance has increased beyond affordability for some businesses which could not get their insurance renewed because it was impossible for them. The extra cost they must pay is borne by the business and puts the sustainability of a business on the line, which mean it is a threat to business. In addition, older people can no longer get cover. It just comes to an end. There is no regard for their accident-free record or the fact that their car has passed its NCT and everything is okay. It is just a decision by the insurance company not to provide cover. When pressed, companies give a quote that is so excessive as to be unaffordable. That is not fair to an age group that has worked hard to create the country in which we live. They have made their contribution and they should not be hindered in their efforts to get insurance. Another cohort of people that wrote to the committee in considerable numbers was individuals returning from abroad and trying to get work. They found they were unable to renew their insurance easily on returning to this country. Likewise, young people living here who were new to the employment market who wanted to get insurance or those who had a car of a certain age could not get insurance. In some cases new drivers were not even quoted for insurance. There have also been ridiculously high increases in premia which is not explained in the documentation they receive from insurance companies. That is another gap in the information that should be available. People want to know why their premium has increased and what is going on. It is clear that as insurance companies prepare for the next tranche of regulation they are covering their losses and potential losses to such an extent that it is not bearable in the market. It is also clear in the report that far from losing money insurance companies were making considerable amounts of money over many years. I accept they experienced a blip following the crash, as did most businesses, but that changed significantly subsequently. There is no real explanation for the increase in premia. That brings me back to our 71 recommendations and the report of the Minister of State. I referred previously to the book of quantum. The other area, which I firmly believe is important is one I raised this morning with the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, because she is responsible for the CSO Vote. The CSO should be involved in the collection of data on insurance because it is an independent and respected organisation with the capability to collect the data necessary and to make it available to the Irish market and also to those who might seek to come into the market. The office has a staff of 750 and it has the capability to do the work required. The office is professional and is recognised as such, which is hugely important. We should involve the CSO in what we are doing. I say that to counter the argument that it should be the job of the Central Bank. The Central Bank has abandoned the consumer. Having read all the complaints, I have come to the conclusion that it is not interested in consumer protection. I accept the office has an individual who has responsibility for consumer protection but I do not know anyone who has received protection. I do not know anyone who has got answers. Neither do I know any insurance company that has been hauled over the coals for its attitude to individuals in the marketplace. The individual person or small business seeking a quote does not matter to the Central Bank.They are not significant enough in the big picture plan it has but they are significant to me and the Members of this House who represent them and who see at first hand every single day big insurance companies taking huge premiums from individuals who cannot afford to pay them. Yes, they must pay for insurance but not at the price currently being asked.  I believe the Central Bank's regulation of insurance companies needs to be far more heavy-handed in the context of making them comply. One factor that feeds into the increase in premiums is the fact that Irish companies are asked to pick up the tab for a failed insurance company. So many Irish people have been caught by a failed company with headquarters outside Ireland. We must find a method of ensuring they are regulated and that some fund is in place that can be relied on should one of those companies go bust in the future. To request businesses to pay for a business that has gone bust seems to be a perverse notion. If one of my competitors went bust, I certainly would not be looking to assist or bail them out. The Government needs to produce some strategy relating to how it deals with this.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has functioned extremely well but it needs to be modernised and its powers expanded. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, disagrees with this and I understand his argument but I still suggest that if certain legal fees could be paid at that level, it might discourage those who are simply trying to cover their costs and get their affairs sorted from going to a higher court. The court would not be clogged up, more expensive lawyers at that level would not be required and the costs would be sorted out at that level. There are simple measures to implement legislation that has not been commenced that we need to consider.  The Minister of State needs to look at the legislation introduced by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, in respect of jurisdiction. This needs to be reversed. I refer to sending definite signals to the industry that the Minister of State means business. I admire the work he has done and his grasp of the brief but sending positive signals in a shorter period of time would tell the market the Government means business, is not rolling over any more, is acting in the interests of the consumer and will make sure that the Central Bank, the CSO and others will get into the act and ensure that premiums in the future are reduced significantly because people cannot afford them now. 
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	387	I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann this evening on the report on the cost of motor insurance produced by the working group I chair and the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. A significant amount of work has been done by both groups and we have had a number of engagements, including one this morning. I will put some of the details of the working group report we have produced on the record of the House. I am very aware of the importance of these reports and of the higher premiums people throughout the country are paying and the impact on their lives, businesses and ability to afford things generally as they go about their working week. This is why there has been a special commitment on the part of the Government to address this issue. It is why the working group's report has this dedicated timeline and these dedicated 71 actions. The Government is taking action on this, as is the Oireachtas. If we work together, we can bring stability to the market for motor insurance and deliver measures to ensure fairer premiums for customers. Our focus is on protecting the consumer while ensuring that we have a modern, transparent, stable and competitive insurance sector. I acknowledge the work of the report on motor insurance produced by the Oireachtas joint committee chaired by Deputy McGuinness and the work of the members of that committee and the significant amount of time they have put into this area. I thank Deputy McGuinness for his summary of that report and his earlier comments in the committee this morning. There is a considerable overlap between our respective pieces of work. In implementing the action plan outlined in the working group's report, which already has commenced, the Government will address many of the recommendations contained in the committee's report. The manner in which the committee has worked with the working group is the way we all should approach our work together to try to come to constructive solutions we can get through the House as quickly as possible.  I will put on record some of the action points in the working group's report in order that people can be clear about what we are trying to do with our 71 actions. Last July, I was asked to chair the working group report dealing with the various factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance. We brought together various Departments to do that work, including the Departments of Finance, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Justice and Equality. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was on the working group, as were the State Claims Agency and the Central Bank of Ireland. The objective of the working group was to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance with particular focus on motor insurance - we have commenced work on public liability and employers' insurance - and to recommend short, medium and longer-term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs while taking account of the requirement for an economically vibrant and financially stable insurance sector.  I initiated the work of the group by establishing four subgroups to examine particular issues. They were understanding the motor insurance market, improved data availability, the cost of claims and other public policy issues. We then began consulting widely meeting with representatives from AA Ireland, Auto Records Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Car Rental Council of Ireland, the Irish Road Haulage Association, Insurance Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann and the CEOs from AIG, AXA, Aviva, FBD, Liberty Insurance and RSA Insurance. Further submissions were received from other interested parties and these were considered as part of the process. The work then began to build consensus around the causes of the problem and to identify appropriate actions to be implemented as soon as possible to restore some stability to pricing in the motor insurance market. Deputy McGuinness spoke about the blame game at committee level. My approach was to look to the future, move beyond that blame game and figure out how we were going to solve this problem. The committee and the working group share that approach.  The deliberations of the group culminated in the publication of the report on the cost of motor insurance on 10 January 2017. The report contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions in an action plan across six main themes. They are protecting the consumer, improving data availability, improving the personal injuries claims environment, reducing the costs in the claims process, reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving and promoting road safety and reducing collisions. A number of actions are already under way and I am confident that the report's 71 actions will be implemented by the end of 2018 with 45 due to be completed this year. Some of the key recommendations include actions to address the lack of transparency in the claims environment through the establishment of a national claims information database, which will be located in the Central Bank. I note Deputy McGuinness's comments about the CSO and I will come back to them later in the debate. Others recommendations include addressing the increasing level of uninsured driving through the establishment of a fully functioning database, which will allow An Garda Síochána to check insurance compliance through the use of technology such as automatic number plate recognition, addressing the issue of suspected fraud through the establishment of a database that will be funded by industry but held by an independent body and that will take into account data protection concerns and providing enhanced guidance in how to determine compensation for personal injuries claims through the establishment of a personal injuries commission. I will now provide some more detail on some of these issues. One of the key findings of the report is the need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection to the level that we see in other jurisdictions. This was a common theme of discussions with a wide range of stakeholders and is a matter which needs to be addressed. Currently in Ireland, claims data related to motor insurance are available from a variety of sources. However, such data are not collected or produced for the purpose of improving transparency on emerging risks within the market. Pricing of insurance premiums reflects a current view on the likelihood and cost of claims into the future. Transparency of claims data could feed into insurers' current view of future risks and improve their ability to price more accurately and reduce the cyclicality of their pricing. It should be noted that no organisation is currently responsible for the collection of data from insurers for this purpose thus representing a clear information gap. The working group developed a phased approach to tackle this issue. In the short term, it recommended commencing a short-term publication on a quarterly basis of a number of key aggregated claims-related metrics to be provided by the insurance sector.  Work has begun on the implementation of this recommendation and a request for data will issue to insurance undertakings before the end of this quarter for completion. The metrics will then be published for the first time in the second quarter of this year. This initial metrics publication will act as a stepping stone for the establishment of a national claims information database by the middle of 2018 which will provide more detailed claims information and should facilitate a more in-depth annual claims trends analysis. The Central Bank will hold this database. It is expected that the national claims information database will provide data on what claims are being made against property or for personal injuries, the legal and other costs that are being incurred and the channel of resolution and what impact that has on the final settlement, among other things. It should assist in identifying emerging risks in the market, such as claims trends and costs. The information will be collected and stored at a level of aggregation higher than individual claim level, that is, not on a claim-by-claim information basis. The working group also considered the concept of a claim-by-claim register, but came to the conclusion that it does not, in the short to medium term, provide a feasible or credible solution. Relevant to this conclusion was the fact it has not been possible to identify an international precedent for such an all-encompassing claims level register and that such a register would carry a significant cost and lead-in time, both in terms of development and establishment. It was agreed, however, that consideration will be given to such a register at a later stage once the national claims information database is close to establishment in the first half of next year. The second area where data availability is an issue is in the field of uninsured driving. Figures from the Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, show that the level of uninsured driving in Ireland rose from less than 5% in 2011 to 2013 to 7.1% in 2015. The MIBI is responsible for meeting the claims of those who have been in a collision involving an uninsured or untraceable driver. It pays out approximately €50 million to €60 million annually to meet such claims and this cost is passed directly on to motorists. The insurance industry estimates that this adds about €30 to each motorist’s premium. It is imperative therefore that we tackle this issue without delay. The working group has recommended the establishment of a fully functioning database of insured and uninsured drivers to enable gardaí to check motor insurance compliance effectively. A project group has been established between the MIBI and Insurance Ireland to create a central database which will contain certain information required by the Road Traffic Act 2016, such as the driving licence number and policy number of each policyholder. The ultimate aim is to provide An Garda Síochána with a mobile app, on an authorised user basis, to allow for roadside access to the database. The report sets a deadline of the third quarter of this year for the database to go live for privately owned vehicles. Fraud, like uninsured driving, has been highlighted as an area where more information can reduce its impact on the cost of premiums. While the vast majority of claims are genuine, there is a perception that insurance fraud is a victimless crime. Nothing could be further from the truth and fraudulent claims, whether of an opportunistic and exaggerated nature or through highly organised crime rings, need to be addressed and made as difficult as possible to get away with. In this regard, the insurance industry has estimated that fraud costs it in the region of €200 million each year, adding approximately €50 to each premium. To deal with this problem, the report recommends the establishment by the end of next year of a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for the industry to detect patterns of fraud. It is likely to be modelled on a UK equivalent system, and will be funded by the industry but managed by an independent not-for-profit body. This will be progressed in tandem with actions to ensure any data protection issues are appropriately addressed. Another core recommendation is the establishment of a personal injuries commission to investigate and make recommendations on processes in other jurisdictions which could enhance the claims process in Ireland. The terms of reference for that commission are set out in the report and they include the commissioning of medical research, benchmarking of international awards for personal injury cases, analysing and reporting on international compensation levels, and compensation mechanisms. The need to begin this work immediately has been recognised by Government and on 10 January the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor, appointed former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, as chairperson of that commission. The other members are representatives from stakeholders that include the medical, legal and insurance sectors as well as relevant Departments and agencies. The commission met for the first time on 10 February and has agreed a work plan. While the above measures could be seen as the core recommendations, the report should very much be seen as a package of reforms which, when implemented together, will provide for greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help to prevent the volatility we have seen in the market in recent times. This package of measures also addresses the issue of protecting the consumer, for example, through the extension of the current renewal notification timeframe by five working days. In addition, the Department of Finance is working with Insurance Ireland to develop protocols to require insurers to set out reasons for large increases in premiums and to assist returning emigrants by requiring insurers to accept driving experience from abroad where a person has previous driving experience in Ireland. We touched upon this in detail earlier today at the meeting of the committee. I note the Chairman's commitment and the committee's commitment to addressing this issue. A portion of the recommendations also centres on reducing costs in the claim process in tandem with the running of the personal injuries commission. These actions will seek to maximise the usefulness of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and to improve the book of quantum. Further reviews will also take place to examine the impact of the changes in the court jurisdictional limits, the setting of the discount rate in personal injuries lump sum awards, and the introduction of periodic payment orders. The implementation of the review of the motor insurance compensation framework is also ongoing as we speak. The heads of a Bill are to be brought to Government by the second quarter of this year. Actions have also been recommended to develop a protocol to require insurers to require proof of a national certificate of roadworthiness, NCT, and to promote compliance with road safety legislation. Insurance Ireland will also present the working group with a report on the use of telematics in Ireland by the end of the year. I will continue to drive the effective and timely implementation of this action plan over the next two years through the working group. In addition, the House should be aware that the second phase of the working group’s review of insurance costs has commenced, as I stated. Based on submissions we have received from the small business sector in particular, we will review and make recommendations to tackle the rising cost of employer and public liability insurance. This is an important issue from a competitiveness perspective, and we will be meeting the relevant private sector stakeholders over the next couple of weeks. I appreciate the opportunity we have had today to discuss the important objective of reducing the cost of motor insurance. I welcome the constructive debate we have had at committee and look forward to hearing the comments of others in this engagement. I have said on a number of occasions that there is no silver bullet to stem immediately or reverse premium price rises. The Chairman in his own committee report acknowledged that as well. With the implementation of these reforms, however, as well as co-operation and commitment between all stakeholders - Government, the insurance sector and the wider Oireachtas - we can create a stable and more accessible market which can deliver fairer premiums for consumers without unnecessary delay. We can achieve the above for the consumer while also protecting the stability of the insurance market. I thank the members of the working group who put in such a great time commitment and dedication that went above and beyond the normal commitments people make to such efforts. Given the importance the Oireachtas has placed on this issue, almost every Member of the House has been in touch with me about it. I know the Oireachtas committee has a commitment to this. I, as chairman of the working group, have a very strong commitment to this. That is why we have an action plan. That is why there are owners for each action who are responsible for making sure that they take place. That is why there is a timeframe in place for all quarters of this year and next. I have made a commitment to produce quarterly reports. In fact, we will be producing an interim report on a quarterly report to the committee following our engagement this morning. I am more than happy to appear again in front of the committee to make sure we get this done. It will take collaboration between the Oireachtas and the Government to drive these reforms of the insurance sector to deliver what people want to see, which is a fair and transparent market in order that the people can get insurance they can afford and go about their daily lives as they need to week in and week out. That is the commitment I have given to the committee and give to the House today.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	388	I welcome the fact we are debating this report at last. This is not an issue that has sprung up overnight. The figures over recent years show the increase in motor insurance in 2014 was 11.6%, in 2015, there was a further increase of 30.8%, and in the twelve months leading to August 2016, there was an increase of 28%. The Minister of State has quite rightly said there is no silver bullet that is going to fix this. While we welcome the report and support many of the recommendations, we have to acknowledge that for many years there was total and utter inaction on behalf of the Government of which the Minister of State was a member in bringing about solutions to the issues that are facing so many people. If we look honestly at where this originated, it goes back to last year in 2016 when we as a party brought forward a policy of recommendations on how to tackle the exorbitant costs of insurance. Subsequent to that, we tabled a Private Members' motion that was debated, voted on and passed by this House.It was then taken up by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach, who engaged extensively with many varied groupings on what needed to be done to tackle the high cost of insurance. I compliment Deputy McGuinness and his committee and the many witnesses who came before it and engaged with it to examine what could be done to address this issue. We have been three years examining this problem but I believe those three years have been wasted. Nobody will tell the Minister of State that their insurance premium has decreased in the past three years. I am sure my constituency colleague and the Minister's party colleague brought the example I am about to give to his attention. Only this week, the owner of a small courier firm in Mullingar, in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, who has three vans on the road went to insure another van because he was getting additional work and he intended to employ another driver, both of which were to be welcomed. The insurance company sought €4,500 to provide that cover to allow the additional van go on the road. He could not do it. He bought the van and put one of his older vans off the road. That is sitting idle in the yard. When we consider the Minister of State's recommendations in terms of Objective 1, protecting the customer, that insurers provide additional information on the breakdown of the cost to consumers, that man must wait until the end of 2018 before he will get a breakdown of how the company came up with that figure. We are already three years in and some of the objectives will not be implemented until the end of 2018. It will have taken five years to have some of the issues resolved. There is a reference in the report to further consultation and review on review. That is a concern because we will still be waiting in a number of months or years and the people about whom the Minister of State spoke, namely, the hard pressed motorists who rely on their cars to get to work and go about their daily lives, will still be paying high insurance costs in a number of years from now. One of the main factors in the rising cost of insurance is the issue of personal injury claims, which the insurance companies have said has led to the huge increase in insurance costs in recent years. Despite that, in reply to parliamentary questions from my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, there has not been a significant increase in the paying out of compensation in that time. The excuse the insurance companies are giving, therefore, does not add up. It is fair to say, however, that the payout in terms of personal injury claims in Ireland for whiplash and soft tissue injuries is much bigger here than it is in many other jurisdictions in the EU. The Minister of State's report specifically recommends the establishment of the personal injuries commission, which he stated has already been put in place. That is welcome. One of the functions of that commission is to consider the introduction of an international benchmark for personal injury awards, which would bring Ireland in line with other EU jurisdictions. That would ensure that only genuinely injured people would get a fair settlement but it will not be implemented until the end of this year, quarter 4 of 2017. Ultimately, an international benchmark should reduce the costs and frequency of personal injury claims, which would in turn help to address the rising cost of motor insurance for both personal customers and the business community. I would have thought that such international information was readily available or at least it should be. I refer to the role the EU plays in this area and the role our insurance companies play within the EU. Insurance companies can enter the market here from outside our jurisdiction and offer premiums at a very competitive rate because they do not operate under the same terms and conditions as insurance companies registered in Ireland. We know what happens when they go bust. It is left to the Government to pick up the tab, which ultimately results in the additional cost being passed to motorists in their insurance premiums. I may have missed it but I do not see anything concrete in the report in terms of how that issue will be dealt with in the future. If a company from outside this jurisdiction is offering a service or a product here it should adhere to the same terms, conditions and regulations that apply to the Irish companies. On the question of safety and reducing the number of casualties, fatalities and collisions on our roads, unfortunately, the past 12 months was the first time in a long number of years that we witnessed an increase in the number of fatalities and collisions on our roads. The primary reason for that is lack of enforcement. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is on a crusade to reduce the drink driving limit but he and the Government would be better placed if they ensured that there was a greater Garda presence on our roads and that the existing legislation was implemented. That would do a great deal to reduce the number of collisions and fatalities on our roads. I welcome that the report has been launched and that the Minister of State has set targets, which must be acknowledged. However, I am concerned about the length of time needed to reach those targets, some of which extend into quarter 4 of 2018. I ask that this aspect continue to receive the priority that is warranted and that, if at all possible, the targets would be accelerated because we need to ensure that returning emigrants, younger drivers and drivers with older cars can get a reduction in their insurance premiums and that they pay a fair price to have their cars insured on the road.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	389	I do not doubt for a minute that the Minister of State has put a great deal of work and effort into producing this report and examining this issue over the last while but the level of disappointment and, in many cases, despair at the failure of this report, with all its recommendations and promised actions, to address it in any way that will impact in any meaningful sense on the tens of thousands of drivers who are in a desperate position because of the hiked insurance premiums is quite stark. Nothing in the report will impact directly on the extortionate profiteering levels of premium that mean many people are now literally, and it is not a pun, being driven off the road.They cannot afford to pay the premiums being asked of them. They hoped this report would do something about it, but quite plainly it does not. The Minister of State put it mildly when he said there was no silver bullet. It is a phrase he used liberally in the various interviews he did at the time of the report, which was repeated in the replies to a number of parliamentary questions and in the introduction of the report. To say there is no silver bullet is putting it mildly. There is no bullet at all. There is no action which will actually impact on premiums in a way that would make them affordable. This is why people are worried. The stakes in this are pretty high. The Minister of State mentioned Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann. I attended its AGM several weeks ago. To be honest, I was quite shocked by the accounts I heard. Some of the taxi drivers told me afterwards they were literally suicidal because the premium on their car, which is their livelihood, had increased to such a point they simply could not afford it and their jobs were gone. The livelihood was gone. That was it, they were off the road. It is not exaggeration because we know suicides among taxi drivers spiked dramatically after deregulation. The Minister of State will remember there were protests a number of years ago by the predecessor of Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann, Taxi Drivers for Change, because there was a terrifying spike in suicides among taxi drivers. I witnessed a level of despair among people trying to make a living and working very hard. Taxi drivers have been hammered by deregulation over recent years and are struggling to make a living. For this to be loaded on top of them has broken the back of many of them. I will give some examples. In one year, the premium of one driver with no claims or accidents increased from €1,500 to €10,200. A new taxi driver seeking insurance on his taxi for the first time was quoted €11,000 third party only. This is unbelievable. In one year, the premium of another taxi driver with a full no claims bonus increased from €1,800 to €5,638 and his cover was reduced from fully comprehensive to third party. If drivers actually have a claim they are gone. That was the message. These are people without claims, including new drivers and people with a no claims bonus, who are seeing 300%, 400% and 500% increases. A taxi firm in Limerick, Tower Cabs, which has eight taxis, saw its insurance for the fleet increase 700% from €7,000 to €56,000. This is just not sustainable. It will be out of business if something is not done about this. I have just come from a protest of taxi drivers, young people and pensioners. All of the drivers there said they are terrified about their premium coming up for renewal. They do not know what they will do. If it is anything like this, they just will not be able to afford it. What will the Minister of State do for them? There is nothing in the report that does anything for them. They will be gone. Taxi drivers are a critical part of our public transport infrastructure. They asked whether there could be recognition from this or any Government that taxi drivers are part of our public transport infrastructure, that we need them and that they should not just be thrown to the wolves and taken for granted as if we can do anything to them and they will just be there. They cannot do it any more. Many of them are being broken by the experience. Their mental health is breaking down, their livelihood is being taken from them and they do not know how they will manage. I appeal to the Minister of State. There has to be recognition - there is none at present - of the role that taxi drivers play in our public transport system and premiums have to be set at a level that allows them to function in their job. If not, the Minister of State will write off the livelihood of thousands of people and it is not fair. I have quoted examples of people who have had no claims. Obviously if there is a sustained record of accidents or bad driving a significant increase in premium might be justified, but in the day-to-day doing of a taxi driver's job people may have little prangs, but if they have a little prang now, even the smallest thing that is not their fault, they are gone. Only two insurance companies will insure them as it stands. I and the taxi drivers appeal to the Minister of State because it is a ticking time bomb for taxi drivers. They have no choice but to fight this. They have told me they are absolutely determined they will fight because their livelihood is on the line. I appeal to the Minister of State on this level. The taxi drivers approached me and asked me to help them get a campaign going on this because they were so disappointed. The other groups who came along to the press conference we held today included students and young people who are banjaxed with these premiums. Young men in particular are affected. It is really putting them in a very difficult position. There are excessive premiums for older cars. Young people do not have much money and they buy older cars. Today, the USI president said young people are charged premiums of €5,000 or €6,000, which is three times what they receive in a grant but they need these cars. They cannot do it, which inhibits them from being able to apply for certain types of jobs. Students from the country in particular may have to go back and forth from college in the city to the countryside. The other group involved is the elderly. For many of them, their car is their lifeline. It is their connection into society and their ability to get around. They are experiencing massive hikes in their premiums. As a category, they are being discriminated against. I want to emphasise the phrase discriminatory premiums. Particular categories are being targeted and tarred with one big brush, with extortionate premiums imposed on them because the insurance companies decide to do so. It is baseless. The elderly are much less likely to drink and drive, much less likely to go out in traffic and much less likely to drive at night. These are all the places that might put more in danger. However, they are hit with higher premiums. There is no justification for these premiums because road safety has improved dramatically in recent years, with fewer collisions and fewer fatal collisions. This is profiteering. What is necessary is a cap on premiums. I would like a State insurance company, as there is in Canada and elsewhere. If the Minister of State is not willing to do this, and it is what is necessary, we need caps on premiums to make them affordable and we need an end to discrimination. There cannot be categories of drivers who are discriminated against and persecuted in this way. I appeal to the Minister of State that we need action or there will be an explosion of anger on this issue.

The major focus is on the cost of motor insurance but I wish to comment on the issue of public liability also. The key issue is implementation of the recommendations and for people outside and in the House to achieve reduced motor insurance premiums. I have no doubt this is the intention of the Minister of State and the intention of the House. I would like to see more mention of proactive monitoring of the targets and finding solutions for many of the issues raised today. Year on year we have seen massive increases in premiums. Deputy Troy referred to the figures and I will not go back over them.The problem is that there is no competition in the marketplace. It is appalling that it took until January 2017 for the Government to respond to this crisis, despite the fact that in every constituency office across the country the young, the middle aged, the old and the returning diaspora were complaining that motor insurance costs were spiralling out of reach. We need urgent action and do not want to see this report gathering dust. The key recommendations outline what Fianna Fáil proposed in its policy previously. They need to be acted on. It is not acceptable that legal claim costs are the reason premiums are increasing. Over 70% of personal injury claims are settled out of court and we need more transparency on them. We urgently need to establish benchmarks for claims, some of which are far too high. We need to introduce an insurance fraud database. The market is out of reach for most young drivers. How can they establish themselves as drivers and work up a no claims bonus when they cannot afford the cost of insurance at all? The cost for young drivers driving on a parent or guardian's policy has also gone out of reach. I welcome the working group's recommendations, particularly at the transparency end, to sort out any closed shop mentality prevailing among existing insurers. I will not go over Fianna Fáil's recommendations as they are on record. A lot of insurance policies for young drivers include the installation of telematic devices to track speed and driver ability. They should be compulsory for all young drivers. They would promote better driving and, more importantly, insurance companies could then be compelled to reward young drivers who used this system by greatly reducing renewal premiums if they abided by the telematics which transmitted information, both to the driver and the companies. These tracking devices should be available to young drivers, the elderly and returning emigrants who wish to prove their driving ability and avail of reductions in their premiums in the shortest possible period. The Minister is not a member of either committee, but can he comment on whether his Department looked at different models of insurance such as a floor insurance, coupled with a Revenue tax on fuel which would ensure one would pay for the distances driven and lighten the undue burden on elderly drivers who are isolated and only use a vehicle for short periods?  I agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on the difficulty of public liability insurance. Unless somebody gets to grips with various organisations such as Tidy Towns and other community groups which do the work of the State in health services and other areas and ensures they can get insurance cover from IPB and others, voluntarism will go out of the window within ten years. Voluntary organisations cannot pay premiums and are struggling with spuriously lodged claims. Work signed off on by local authorities such as CE schemes should be covered and stood over by the local authorities and the State agencies the work of which they are doing.

There is commonality with a report produced by our own party early last year and one from January this year on how we might address issues such as the lack of transparency of data. There are also a lot of concerns about implementation. Deputy Robert Troy gave some figures. He said there had been an increase of 11.6% in the cost of motor insurance in 2014, that in 2015 there had been a further increase of 30.8% and that, in the 12 months to August 2016, there had been an increase of 28%. In his opening comments the Minister of State said the objective of the working group was to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, with a particular focus on motor insurance, and to recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs. That is not enough. The historical increases have been too large and we need a reduction in insurance premiums, not just a levelling out. They have reached an unsustainably high level in the past two or three years and the success of the action plan will be measured by a reduction in premiums. There was a lot of talk about data. I have given figures for the rates of increase, but other things happen which are not captured by data, in particular the number of people who fail to get quotes from motor insurers, particularly on older cars, even if they have passed the NCT test. I wish the Minister of State well in the implementation of his report, but that is not my main concern. I have two concerns. First, I want the key recommendations made in the report which contains 33 recommendations and recommends 70 actions to be identified and the potential savings and reductions given. The Minister of State did this when talking about establishing the database when he said some €50 million or €60 million had been paid out for uninsured drivers, the equivalent of €30 in a premium. There is frustration among the public who are finding it very difficult to cope. A number of things can have more of an impact than others, although I am not saying they should not all be implemented. The Minister of State should consider which actions have the greatest potential for savings on premiums and which could be fast-tracked. He spoke about extending the period of the notice of renewal from 15 to 20 working days but the second quarter of 2018 seems to be an awfully long time to wait. I am concerned about the drift in timelines and some of the targets are for the production of further reports, meaning that the impact on premiums is some way down the road. I wish the Minister of State well and hope his colleagues will row in behind him because he needs to drive this. In May 2016 I asked a question of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. He replied:My Department has been pursuing for some time the establishment of a properly functioning motor insurance database with the insurance industry here to show who is insured and who is not. Such a database would facilitate enforcement by An Garda Síochána, and could make a significant contribution towards reducing the level of uninsured driving in Ireland.In September 2016 I followed up on the issue. The reply on that occasion was:Further discussions have taken place with the insurance industry during 2016 regarding the database, most recently a meeting between my Department, An Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance with Insurance Ireland and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland on Wednesday, 14 September 2016, with a further meeting planned for later this month.  My Department understands from discussion with the industry that the industry hopes to have the database ready for use by An Garda Síochána, my Department and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland early in 2017.In early 2017 I asked the Minister how he was getting on with his database. The reply was:The establishment of the database is a complex piece of work, requiring the insurance industry to gather certain information from its customers which many currently do not have, and requiring IT changes to datafields and to policy documents.  Until the design and project plan have been agreed, proposed dates for the database to become fully operational are obviously going to be tentative, but the insurance industry is optimistic that an initial phase of the database will be available for testing by end September 2017.The drift of the policy is my concern, not the Minister's integrity or the plan. He needs his colleagues to row in behind him to support the active implementation of the plan in a timely fashion.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	392	I welcome this debate. We are discussing two reports: the Minister of State's report and that produced by the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is chaired by Deputy McGuinness and of which I am also a member. My amendment called on the committee to undertake that work. The Chairman prioritised that work because we can all see the type of pressure that has been put on individuals and businesses throughout the State in recent years. It was about time that action was taken on this matter. I appreciate that the Minister of State has put a lot of work into this, but I am frustrated by the amount of time it took him to begin the process. We questioned the Minister for Finance time and time again about when he would begin dealing with motor insurance. This predates the Minister of State's work because it has been going on for a number of years. I am saying this because the horse has bolted. We heard statistics from other colleagues in the House concerning the increases year on year, and I do not want to rehash those. We know, however, that over the past three years there has been a 70% increase in premiums. The Central Statistics Office says that, last year, premiums increased by just under 9%. Looking at the last quarter, increases were marginal and in some cases there were no increases, although the last month has shown a month-on-month rise of about 1.8%, which is alarming. The insurance companies have done the dirty deed. They have completely and utterly fleeced their customers. They have done so because they pursued a reckless policy. They had a model which the ordinary lay person would say was based on taking premiums and then gambling with them, although they called that investing them in international stock markets. They gambled and expected a return of 4% or 5% on safe government bonds. However, because of what the ECB has done with quantitative easing, we all know that investing in German bonds, and in some cases in Irish bonds, means the returns are negative. That is what happened. I mean no offence to any of the previous speakers but we are talking about things that are marginal to what happened over the past three years. That is why I was forced to amend the original motion. At the time, I commended the Deputy on bringing forward the motion, but it fell into that trap which is what the insurance industry wants us to believe, that this is about fraud, high legal fees, uninsured drivers or the risk of something that has not happened, such as Setanta Insurance or changes to the courts. That is all bullshit, however. It is absolute nonsense. That is not what caused a 70% increase in premiums. I challenge anybody, in either report, to show us that is the case. The Minister of State's report talks about fraud in the context of a footnote. There are about 15 recommendations concerning fraud, which I welcome. Anybody who denies there is fraudulent activity going on in motor insurance would be a fool. We all have to work together to stamp it out and get to the core of what caused drivers to be fleeced. Some people who required their business vehicles to keep food on the table found their mental health was seriously impacted. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that fraud has increased over the past three years and the same applies to legal fees. The Minister of State's report says that increases in legal fees do not contribute to a significant increase in premiums. Of course they do not. Meanwhile, the industry peddles the idea that it is because of Setanta Insurance. If Setanta Insurance had to pay up in the morning, it would cost €90 million, yet the insurance companies have increased premiums over the past three years by multiples of that. Therefore, it is not that either, so what is it? It concerns the model they had, which was rightly identified in the committee's report but is completely absent in the Minister of State's report. The Minister of State's recommendations should be implemented, but let me add a caveat. In no way should we be privatising our police force. In no way should we be allowing multinational companies to fund members of the Garda Síochána directly. It is unacceptable and will not be accepted on Sinn Féin's watch. I understand the motivation for it. The Minister of State says it is being pushed heavily by the industry and that the model is in place in Britain, but it is a flawed model. The London Metropolitan Police has been doing this since 2012 or 2013, but it has also been doing other things. There is a privatisation agenda concerning the police and other sectors in Britain, but we should not follow that model. Those recommendations are fine in other areas. The timeframe for them is incredible in my view. Some of them are obvious, such as the action points. For example, we are told the Department will monitor EU developments. I would have serious concerns if the Department was not monitoring them, so that does not merit being put down as an action point. Another action point was for the industry to develop a protocol by quarter 2 and another one by quarter 4. As regards the third action point, the industry will say it has done that. The number of action points has been beefed up a bit with some things which are not really action points, but that could be seen as nit-picking. My concern about some of the action points is the delay in implementing them. Let us look at drivers who had to leave this country. By the end of quarter 2 of this year we will have a protocol to recognise the experience of drivers who are driving in England. That does not make sense. Why is it not in the interests of the insurance industry? They are driving on the same roads. If I go to England my insurance premium does not go up and I do not have to get new insurance. In addition, we have to wait another six months to get a protocol agreed for those who drive on the other side of the road. It is incredible. If I go to France I do not have to get a special dispensation from my insurance company that I am going there for a month and will be driving there. If I am insured, the policy covers me across Europe. Why would one have to wait for six months when Insurance Ireland already has a protocol to accept the experience and no claims bonus of returning emigrants, which is available on its website? If all of this had been implemented three years ago, would it have prevented a 70% increase in premiums? No, it would not. That is because something different happened. It was a flawed business model by the insurance industry. I am not quoting him directly but the then Central Bank governor, Mr. Honohan, said that they were involved in risky practices and started to use up their capital reserves. That is what happened. New CEOs were put in place across the insurance companies, and because this State makes it compulsory to have motor insurance, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. One after another, therefore, we got our increased renewals in. This report will not do anything about that, however, because the motion passed in this House was to investigate the Central Bank's handling of the matter, and it has not been done. The Central Bank's handling of consumer protection issues, and this is not directed at any individuals in the Central Bank, whom I am sure are working hard, was pathetic and unbelievable. Some 15,000 people will be repaid for tracker mortgages. Some 22% of all payment protection insurance sold in this country was paid back just two years ago in the sum of more than €70 million. If that happened in any other industry, such as high street shops, they would all be in Mountjoy jail. It is big business, however, so instead of holding them to account we say they should pay for our police They give us a few pounds and indirectly employ gardaí to help them increase their profits.That is what the Minister of State is doing here. The recommendation the Government brought forward is unbelievable. What is more unbelievable is the fact that the Government has not dealt with the boom-and-bust business model the insurance companies have used. That boom-and-bust cycle must be broken. They have sorted out their books and it is unlikely that we will see further massive increases. However, as somebody who 20 years ago began his first campaign outside of a political party on the rising costs of motor insurance, I guarantee that this will happen again unless the Government tackles the Central Bank issue or authorises direct state intervention in the insurance market.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	393	I compliment my colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, and the committee on the work they have put into this. I understand and believe the Minister of State is very sincere on this issue and puts a great deal of work into it. It is absolutely necessary that we get most of these recommendations in place without delay. The best approach for me, to be practical about it, is to give examples. These are examples that have come into my constituency office in respect of Roscommon, Ballinasloe and Strokestown. These are the cases my constituents in Galway-Roscommon are bringing to me. A girl of 19 years with no penalty points and no claims has seen her insurance go from €3,500 to €5,100. Another young lady is 18 and a half years old and owns a car purchased by her parents at a cost of €2,800. The car flew through the NCT and has low mileage. Her insurance quotation was €6,500. The Minister of State might recall that one of the first items I dealt with when I entered the Dáil was the difficulty people with wheelchair accessible taxis were having. I had it out with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, about the case of a young man in Carrick-on-Shannon who bought a vehicle and obtained a grant to convert it. Prior to that, he had sought and been given an insurance quote of €4,000. When he went back, lo and behold, he was quoted €12,500. He went ahead with the business and is paying back an enormous sum each month. I was approached by another lady who sought insurance cover for a wheelchair accessible taxi and was refused quotations by nine companies. Among those companies was one which is involved in sponsoring the Special Olympics. What a fraud that is. I use that word. These people give money to sponsor the Special Olympics while refusing cover to a wheelchair accessible taxi. I am aware of another case of parents who bought an eight year old car in the Dublin region. Coming from Dublin, the Minister of State knows that a Dublin car can have low mileage after eight years. In this case, the mileage was 60,000 km because the car had not been used much by the previous owners, an elderly couple. It was sold for €2,900. The car flew through the NCT. All it needed was a new set of tyres. It was a perfect vehicle yet no company would insure it. This is the latest problem. In recent months, eight, nine and ten year old cars are not being insured. We must look again at the practicalities of this. We have an NCT, which we all agree is a good thing. The NCT is very rigid and one will not get away with much. We all acknowledge that to be good. We then have a situation in which the Irish motor insurance business refuses to insure cars that have been passed by the system and are in excellent working order. A car might be bought by parents for a student in Maynooth or Dublin or Limerick, but that individual cannot get insurance cover. These situations are outrageous and it is getting worse. As colleagues have pointed out, we now find that more and more elderly citizens with impeccable records are being refused cover. The following really annoys me. We have a good and rigid system of driving tests. Again, that is good. One has to go through ten driving lessons, a theory test and a driving test. Young people go through that but before they ever sit into their own car, they are penalised by the insurance business. Why should one penalise someone who has not committed an offence or received penalty points? All of these matters need to be looked at. We need a root and branch reform of the insurance business. The Minister of State is committed to doing it but it cannot be put off for a year or two. It must be done. In recent weeks, a situation was brought to my attention whereby a lady who was a nurse in a major hospital has packed her bags and gone to Australia because she could not get car insurance at less than €5,000. That is the reality of what the motor insurance business is doing to us.

We welcome the working group's report. The key issue is implementation and the reduction of motor insurance premiums. Premiums for consumers in Cavan, Monaghan and across the country are soaring while the Government drags its feet on the issue. Fianna Fáil has long called on the Government to act on the rising cost of motor insurance. In 2014, motor insurance costs increased at an annual rate of over 11% while in 2015, they rose by 30%. In the 12 months to August 2016, motor insurance costs increased by 28%. It is completely frustrating that it has taken until now for the Government to respond on this major issue. Fianna Fáil proposed a policy in the middle of 2016 on motor insurance premiums and has contributed heavily to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach's report on the rising cost of motor insurance. These policies and reports require a Government response to tackle the issue. The key recommendations of the committee mirror what we proposed in our own policy and the key issue now is implementation. The report will be of no use unless it is followed by Government action and, ultimately, reduced motor insurance premiums. People are contacting my constituency office on a weekly and daily basis to complain about rising insurance costs. I have heard horrendous stories from people in my constituency who were involved in accidents with individuals that were uninsured. A person badly injured in such an accident is forced to follow it up with the Insurance Federation of Ireland for compensation. I am sorry to say that I feel it is a direct result of the Government's failure to address the high cost of insurance premiums. Since January 2011, the cost of insurance has rocketed by 51% in some instances. Business customers needing to insure cars, vans, fleets and buses have fared even worse. Some people who have returned to this country to find a job or who have returned to work for the first time since the recession as self-employed business persons have told me they cannot get motor insurance. Fianna Fáil has raised this issue in the Dáil consistently and put forward numerous motions and published proposals to tackle these exorbitant costs. It is an issue that is affecting thousands of people across Cavan and Monaghan. Motor insurance is not an additional thing we need, it is a legal requirement. People are now seriously considering whether they can afford a car at all. It is a growing irritation among motorists who are having to fork out for insurance, motor tax and high fuel costs, many of whom feel completely ripped off. Businesses are also being hit with the rise in premiums squeezing profits and ultimately risking jobs. It has taken the Government too long to wake up to the problem which had already become a crisis before it called on the finance committee to find ways to curb the rising cost of insurance. These recommendations were signed off last November, but it is only this week that they have come to Cabinet. There is no sense of urgency from the Government on this matter, which is deeply worrying for the thousands of motorists whose premiums continue to increase.I am worried about the timeline being reported regarding implementation of the committee's proposals. It has been suggested that it could take as long as 18 months before certain measures, such as the creation of a detailed database to combat fraud, are implemented. This indicates that the Government is not paying the right attention to the crisis. The key recommendations around the following issues are mirrored in our policy and the committee's recommendations: protecting the consumer; improving data availability; improving the personal injuries claims environment; reducing the costs in the claims process; reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving; and promoting road safety and reduced collisions. I ask the Minister of State to take charge of the situation and ensure that these proposals are implemented without delay so that the rip-off culture which has been perpetrated by the insurance industry over the past number of years is effectively tackled.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	395	The increase in motor insurance prices over the past three years is unjustified and unsustainable. It is placing major financial stress on citizens and businesses. Up to July 2016, motor insurance costs have increased by 30% year-on-year. The CSO figures over a three-year cycle show increases in the range of 70%. In some cases, insurance premiums and quotes have risen by as much as 200% and 300%. The recommendations on the rising cost of motor insurance report of November 2016 need to be implemented as a matter of urgency. We need an integrated insurance database service. We need insurance companies to be mandated to explain why they are increasing their customers premiums. We need to strengthen road safety measures and enforcement of these measures. We need to clamp down on fraudulent and exaggerated claims and ensure that they are pursued and tackled more aggressively by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and insurance companies. As the report recommends, we need to examine the issue of returning immigrants accessing motor insurance and ensure that they are not priced out of the market. The Government needs to review and implement the recommendations of the report as a matter of urgency and not let the situation continue. Citizens and businesses are under significant financial pressure. In 2002, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board made 67 recommendations on the insurance sector. In 2005, the Competition Authority published a report containing 47 recommendations on the insurance sector. However, not all of those recommendations have been implemented. Why were they not implemented? I hope that this report will not face the same fate. We cannot let the report gather dust. Its recommendations must be taken seriously because each day that passes means more businesses are being forced out of business by rising insurance costs. People throughout my constituency in west Cork are continuously ringing my office and pleading with me to force action on this issue in the Dáil. Young people have to pay €4,000 or more to be insured, which is another attack on the people of rural Ireland. We have to use our cars in rural communities where public transport is not readily available. We need action. I ask the Minister of State to act immediately.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	396	I compliment Deputy McGuinness, his team and the officials for their work. I shiver when I see a report or inquiry, with 71 recommendations - seven recommendations would be enough for action, and if we acted on five, three or four we would be doing all right. The Association of British Insurance, ABI, which represents the views of the UK's insurance industry, stated that the average price paid for comprehensive car insurance in the fourth quarter of 2016 had increased by 4.9% on the previous year, the highest ever increase in England. In Ireland, there is an industrial problem of collusion across the insurance industry. What do people outside of the House think of us in here? They watch us all week and there is a frenzy in the media about scandals, intrigue, evasion, deception and God knows what. This is disgraceful. Some people tell me I have a good turn of phrase, but I do not have the words to describe what is going on. I listened to Deputies McGuinness and Murphy speak earlier. We all have the same experiences every day of the week. Insurance costs have increased by 70%. Insurance companies are reckless and careless. Just when we came out of a recovery, they were mundane enough for a couple of years. I have been in business for 32 years and know all about the cost of insurance. The insurance companies decided, systematically, to jack up prices three years ago. The fools keep paying because they have no choice. One has to have insurance to be on the road. There are uninsured drivers on the road because they cannot get insurance.  Deputy McGuinness referred to the book of quantum, judges and barristers - Deputy O'Callaghan is not here. The fat cats get fatter. There are payouts for whiplash and everything else. It is a disgusting racket. We heard that people who drive taxis to cater for people with disabilities have been turned down for insurance. I have one myself and sponsored voluntary organisations. The system is obviously very corrupt. My insurance costs went up by over 40% and I got less cover.  Deputy Murphy mentioned young people. 17 year olds have to have 12 driving lessons, which I welcome, and then pass their driving tests but they cannot get insurance. They are criminalised before they go on the road. It is not acceptable. I want to see action. Deputy Collins mentioned a 2002 report which made 61 recommendations. A report in 2005 made 45 recommendations. That is a total of 106 recommendations, none of which were acted on. We do not want reports; we want action. We want to allow returned immigrants, those who want to go to work and those who want to play games in social clubs and community organisations to be able to get insurance. It is crippling the economy. Many members of the Irish Road Haulage Association have moved their businesses to England, Northern Ireland or elsewhere in Europe. They had no choice because of the cost of insurance premiums. The costs for a haulage company in my area increased by 200% and another's costs rose from €50,000 to €120,000 without any claims. It is a licence to print money. If such people were robbing people they would be arrested and locked up. It is robbery without violence. I have experience of it. There were community employment schemes in Newcastle, Ballymacarbry and Ballybacon, but insurance costs increased by €1,000, which meant that the costs for the 15 participants increased from €50 to €150. But for the contact of Deputy Collins and BHP Insurance the matter could not have been addressed. It gave me a quote that was €1,000 less. The company I had been with for more than 20 years, which we thought looked after us and with which we had a good relationship, said it wanted to match the quote. I will not say what I told it to do with the quote. We got the premium from BHP. That is an example of indecent, unashamed and corrupt theft from communities and young people. Anybody and everybody is fair game for such companies. People driving a car, van, truck or tractor or a person in a motorised wheelchair are affected. It is outrageous robbery. It affects businesses right across the country. The Competition Authority is toothless, useless and fruitless. I mean that. It does not get involved with the issue. When companies were taken over, Quinn was blamed. I saluted Quinn. In fairness to the Fianna Fáil Government, it supported Quinn. When Fine Gael came into power, it dumped him down the river. We are supposed to be paying for Quinn and Setanta. We are being fooled. The people expect the Legislature to do something for them. We are doing nothing. We are compiling reports with 71 recommendations. Serious legislation must be introduced. Insurance is one thing and health and safety is another. The NCT has to be paid for. We need some modicum of fair play. Taxis over ten years of age have been put off the road even though they have passed the NCT and another test for luggage and everything else. The same is now happening to other cars that are over ten years old. It is a cosy cartel that stinks to high heaven, with the complicity of Government agencies. The Government is rubbing its hands and doing nothing about it. No action on the report is expected for 18 months. A lot of people will be out of business or will lose their jobs and community organisations will have closed down by then. The courts will be allowed to carry on in a merry-go-round, revolving door fashion. People are given free legal aid to take on cases. Insurance companies are sitting outside of the courts. In my case, several claims were settled outside of the court and the insurance companies did not contest them. It is bordering on total and naked corruption and it is disgusting in the extreme when, as I stated, a company insuring a voluntary organisation could jack the price up by €1,000. When we get a quote of less than €1,000, it says it will match it. It will come down further even. There is then the advertisements on the television about the neighbour or friend "with his hand in my pocket" but these insurance companies have their hands in our pockets. They dig until there is nothing left in the pocket. They leave holes in the pockets of the people. The people are downtrodden. Older people who cannot get insurance for their cars to bring their wives to get their pensions or to the doctor or anything else out in the country are penalised altogether. It is totally outrageous and we are doing nothing about it. No disrespect to the people who gave all their time and work to it, but this report will not be acted on. There are too many items listed in it anyway. It will be filed away like all the other reports. We will have to build a new place for the reports that will be piled up instead of doing up the Chamber in the Seanad. We are the laughing stock of Europe and a laughing stock to the people, but the people are not laughing any more because they are so angry with us for being so useless in defending them from daylight robbery, scams and con artists. They are literally robbing us and having a good time at it and then sponsoring charities to satisfy their consciences. It is disgusting.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-16 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	397	I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight on the issue of car insurance and the reports that are before the House. I will start with the committee report. It states that "[t]he single most important issue identified during [our] hearings was the lack of transparency and shortfall in data-sharing in the insurance sector". I am in favour of shedding light on the activities of a secret industry but I disagree with the statement. I do not believe that to be the single most important issue. The single most important issue is the fact that private insurance companies are making huge profits while utterly failing to provide affordable motor insurance for the majority of people. According to Central Bank data the Minister of State's committee got a hold of, these companies and this industry made €2.86 billion in profits on car insurance alone in the years 2002 to 2017. The committee must give more than a faint nod to that fact when it states that "the premise that recent losses are the reason for insurance premium rises does not hold". This clearly points to the fact of profiteering. The committee goes on to state that "claims and awards are not the driving force behind steep increases..." contrary to the arguments of the insurance industry. Those final words are mine and not those of the report. The report continues, "the level of premium increases far outstrips the actual increase in the amount of claims paid out by the industry". Therefore, the Minister of State's committee is underlining and backing up the argumentation made by motor insurance justice campaigners and socialists and we on the left that profiteering is the root cause, but does not have the courage to come out and say explicitly that that is the case. Then we have the Government's report. The Minister of State wrote the introduction to the report. He states: The burden for reforming the insurance sector naturally rests with the industry. I believe that participants in the industry recognise this and I am sure they will deliver the necessary reform to ensure a stable, transparent and open market place for motor insurance. That is an incredible statement. Why on earth would he believe that the industry would deliver a stable, transparent and open marketplace. It does not and has never done so and it does not want to do so because it masks the trickery that takes place in order to accumulate those massive profits that I referred to earlier. Naturally the burden for reforming the insurance sector rests with the industry. The Minister of State might as well say that naturally the fox must be trusted to look after the chickens. There can be no faith or trust in the people who run this industry. It is not just we on these benches who say it. A hell of a lot of people who are being ripped off when buying car insurance would agree. I will return to the committee report. Buried deep within it, there are a couple of points that point the way forward on the issue. A proposal that was made by our representative on the committee that the State assume the responsibility to provide motor insurance as an essential public utility and provide motor insurance on a progressive non-profit basis that takes account of people's ability to pay was recommended in the official committee report. The report actually outlines the steps that might be taken. One good recommendation is that "the Minister commission a study on the operations, benefits and weaknesses of state insurance models such as those in existence in Canada and New Zealand with a view to possible implementation in Ireland". That is a very good recommendation. If it was taken up seriously, we might look at the example of the Canadian province of Manitoba. In 1971, a Manitoba public insurance company was established to provide basic compulsory car insurance. Forty-five years later it is still providing one of the cheapest car insurance services in North America. Part of its remit is to reduce costs through a transparent charging system that does not discriminate by profiling particular categories of drivers. Young drivers in particular in this country would be very interested to hear a little more about that. However, the Government's concern in its report is to bury recommendations such as that one. Why? It is because the Government supports a completely different model, which is a for-profit and pro-big business model. It is a model where the market is king. In other words, precisely the model that has failed tens of thousands - even hundreds of thousands - of motorists in this country. We argue for a model of a completely different type, which is based on social needs and the needs of the motorists and which puts - Deputy Boyd Barrett will be delighted for the plug - people before profit. Those are the kinds of proposals that would be implemented by a left Government but we have no faith in the insurance industry to reform itself or in the Minister of State's Government to bring forward proposals of that kind. However, it is what is needed.

I took notes and would like to touch on everyone's contribution, if I may, in the time that I have available to me. The Chairman of the Oireachtas committee commented on the deadlines and how we drive the implementation of this report. As I said in the committee today, we have to be realistic about the timelines in terms of certain actions that require public consultation if we are amending legislation or the building of a database and how long it will take. I put in timelines that reflect the time it might take but I have also stated that we will do it more quickly where we can. The House will start to see that in some of the updates that we provided to the committee in terms of the transparent reporting we want to do. I spoke to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, about whether it would host a national claims information database instead of the Central Bank. If I am correct in my memory, its view at the time was that the type of information database that we were talking about would not be appropriate for it, which is why we went for the Central Bank in the end. A different type of claim-by-claim registering mechanism would be appropriate for the CSO but, as I mentioned in the committee, the time and cost involved would be unknown and I did not want to put something that could take five years and cost billions into the report. Therefore, we have gone with a national claims information database, which we think will be sufficient, to be hosted by the Central Bank. Certainly, regarding Setanta, it is essential. Unlike other contributions, I think this is playing upon the fears of insurance companies in terms of their reserving practices and work is being done at the moment to try to bring certainty in relation to the failure of an insurance company in the future. The issue of introducing legal fees at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was raised. Legal fees are there for a small portion of cases depending on the circumstances. We debated it at length earlier on and I take the Deputy's point. My view is that it could be inflationary in the short term without actually delivering the successes we might want to see. As I am quite focused on the short term and how we can help the situation for drivers in the next two years, we have not gone down that path. I concur with the Deputy that section 30 must be commenced. This is set out in the report, as is action on the court jurisdictional limits. I will return to the importance the Deputy places on transparency because unlike the contribution made by the previous speaker before leaving the Chamber, this is incredibly important in terms of understanding what exactly is happening here and protecting consumers in light of concerns that the industry could take a dominant position in the relationship. The Deputy is right to focus on that issue. I thank Deputy Troy for his comments. While I am aware that the problem did not spring up overnight, the troubling spike in premiums has only occurred in the past 12 or 14 months. The Minister for Finance was aware that problems were coming in the area of insurance and moved to examine the compensation framework for insurance first for this reason. We then examined flood insurance because of what happened last winter. That work was completed in June and in July I was appointed as chair of the working group to examine non-life insurance. We prioritised motor insurance because of the impact it is having throughout the country.  The Deputy spoke of too many further reviews being done. The report speaks about actions such as establishing a national claims information database, a fraud database and an uninsured driver database, introducing new legislation and setting up a personal injuries commission. These are actions. Other areas must also be examined, for example, we must look at the models in place in Canada, Australia and New Zealand and do further work on international benchmarking. We are taking action by setting up new databases, introducing new legislation and establishing commissions. We will reform the insurance sector, which is the issue to which the report speaks.  On timelines, we cannot do everything at once. This means we must prioritise some actions over others and be realistic. Deputy Troy is correct that there has not been a significant increase in the pay-out on claims in recent years. This is referred to in the report. However, there has been a major increase in reserving as a result of the uncertainty the insurance companies project in the future. Claims are not settled immediately and take a number of years to process. As changes are introduced, the amount of money companies must reserve also changes. For this reason, we must be careful in this regard. Deputy Pearse Doherty spoke about making changes quickly. If we can make changes quickly, they can be reversed again very quickly. How can we expect companies to operate in an environment in which they do not have certainty as to what exactly the market will be for them in the years ahead? There will be three reporting periods for the personal injuries commission. As such, we will not wait until the commission concludes its work to find out its conclusions. Different reporting periods have been provided for in the terms of reference set out in the report.  International benchmarking cannot be done overnight. We cannot simply find out what the amount of claims is in another jurisdiction. We must ascertain precisely how other systems work, for example, what level of taxation applies, what is the population size, and how the social insurance system and health system operate. All these areas must be considered in terms of how a court may determine an award to be paid.  On freedom of establishment and freedom of services, EU legislation means this cannot be done on the same terms. The Central Bank scrutinises the businesses in question in respect of conduct of business. However, it can only consider factors such as authorisation and prudential work if it has established there. There is, therefore, a difference in this respect. From discussions with the Central Bank, I am aware that it is doing more work in terms of co-operation with other jurisdictions, for example, Malta, to ensure it is fully aware of what is happening in so far as it is monitoring and regulating insurance companies in its jurisdiction that are offering business in other areas.  Deputy Boyd Barrett stated the report did nothing and would not impact on premiums. I am not sure on what basis he made that statement.

I do not have legal power to make such an intervention. I could not do so under EU law. The Deputy referred to my comment that there is no silver bullet. We must properly manage expectations. I cannot give people an expectation that I can change their insurance premium price if they contact me because it is not possible for me to do so.

I must be responsible and I cannot promise something I cannot deliver. I respect the fact that Deputy Boyd Barrett spends a great deal of time listening to the concerns of taxi drivers. It cannot be easy for them and I am aware of the frustrations and difficulties faced by individual taxi drivers. The industry faces particular issues because it operates as a public service and taxis take public passengers. A number of people share one vehicle and some use them for only a period. Many issues arise in this regard and a number of the issues set out in the report will speak to insurance broadly and this will impact on taxi drivers. The report also includes recommendations as to how this specific area can be addressed in future. We will look at that and see what recommendations could flow from that.  The Deputy pointed towards State involvement in the insurance market. If the State were to become involved in the sector, it would face the same costs and problems as private companies in respect of reserving, price and uncertainties concerning pay-outs. The insurance sector would pull out of the riskiest business, leaving the State exposed. As a result, the industry would make even larger profits because it would no longer take risky business. The State would have to take on risky business, which would result in a massive, unquantifiable explosion in costs and taxpayers would have to pay this liability at a point when they cannot pay any more. In addition, this approach would take a number of years and would not resolve the problems we have today or lead to reform of the insurance sector.

We must also consider moral hazard when it comes to driver behaviour. If everyone were to get free insurance, what would be its effect on the way in which people drive on the roads? This is not a casual or throwaway line about moral hazard. We would get some interesting feedback if we were to seek data on the effect on driver behaviour when people renting cars cover the excess versus those who do not do so.  Deputy Boyd Barrett also raised the issue of insurance costs for young and elderly people. Insurers must price based on the risk as they perceive it. If we bring transparency to the information, as the Department and the joint committee are proposing to do, we will be able to identify the actual risk. If we have the data, the insurance companies will be able to price insurance accordingly.  Given the time constraints, I will have to skip through my responses, unless I can have more time.

The lack of transparency in the insurance market is hurting competition. The joint committee focused on this issue. If more companies compete in the market in a safe manner under current Central Bank prudential regulation and the new Solvency II limits and everything else we are trying to achieve in the report, we will attract new entrants to the market in a sustainable and safe manner that will not result in the race to the bottom that we had in the past. The recommendations must be acted upon. For this reason, we have 71 actions stemming from 33 recommendations, with timelines and different owners for each action. Telematics will revolutionise how we drive on our roads and the insurance sector. Some companies use this technology and we want more companies to do so. This is one of the recommendations and actions in the report.  We have examined different models of insurance and more work will be done in this area. Deputies spoke about having insurance costs covered through paying at the pump. This approach would penalise those who drive more. People may argue that those who drive more are more of a risk but that is not necessarily the case. This depends on the routes driven. A pay-at-the-pump model would be highly damaging for business. My initial view is that we should continue to look at models that are based on risk. We have discussed this issue previously but more work will be done on it. It is not, however, a priority because we need to fix the insurance industry we have now to get it to work for people who are purchasing insurance now.  We are examining the issue of public liability while I drive the implementation of the report. We will not have to wait for ten years to fix this sector. What we are trying do through the motor insurance report is a two-year process and the public liability side will be an addendum to the report. We are looking at having a time horizon of between two and three years within which we will have reformed the insurance sector.  Deputy Curran referred to levelling out premiums. As the proposed actions are implemented, we hope to drive fairer premiums for consumers. This would mean a reduction in the increase that consumers have experienced in the past couple of years. We will not return to the types of premiums we had ten years ago because they were not sustainable or affordable.  We have prioritised some actions over others. We had to put in place realistic timelines. The database on uninsured drivers will go live in quarter three of this year, starting with private vehicles. It will not be kicked out any further and the commitment on this in the report will be met.  Deputy Pearse Doherty stated the horse had bolted. This is because we did not have transparency with regard to data, information and the insurance industry. For this reasons, it was not clear exactly what would happen. Now that we are introducing reform and transparency, we will get a better idea of exactly what are the trends in the market and we will be able to take whatever actions are necessary in future to counter them. The boom and bust cycle is referred to in the report from the working group and measures have been implemented to prevent it. One of these is Solvency II, which is very important. The national claims information database will deliver the level of transparency we all seek and will also help prevent a boom and bust cycle developing. I discussed with Deputy Doherty the increase in premiums at a meeting of the joint committee earlier. The Deputy makes relevant points in this regard. We can, in some ways, separate out the history and problems associated with the insurance industry. Part of the problem is that premiums were too low, in other words, underpricing. Part of the problem is the loss in yield from companies' investments abroad to counterbalance the risks they were assuming. Another problem is the recent uncertainties arising from changes in court jurisdictional limits, the introduction of PPOs, issues around Setanta Insurance and other matters. There are two different factors involved in the trend towards increasing premiums in recent years.  I am not recommending the privatisation of the police force and this is not provided for in the report. This approach is working in another jurisdiction and it is only sensible that we examine whether it could work here. I discussed the matter with Deputy Doherty in the committee and we will discuss it again. We should consider the issue to rule it in or out. I cannot give a commitment on a timeline by which an action will be taken at European Union level because action must be taken in a co-ordinated manner involving 27 member states. It will probably not be completed before the Brexit process concludes, although I hope it will not take that long. How can I commit to a timeline that operates at EU level?

In the interest of fairness to the committees of the Houses, the protocol should be observed that it is the committee's report that is taken. However, that is a matter for the Business Committee. During the course of this debate members were speaking to two different reports. Most of the criticism about timelines and so on relates to the Minister of State's report. Most of the reasonable contributions were on the committee report. I am sorry that my socialist colleague, Deputy Mick Barry, is not here but Deputy Boyd Barrett might mention to him that as a socialist myself I accept fully the argument made about taxis. The organisation representing taxis did appear before the committee and made an excellent contribution. I agree that the taxi sector is a part of the SME sector that is weak because of the level of regulation and costs involved and it will not be able to sustain further years of nothing being done. Therefore, in some way, as part of the public transport system, it should be acknowledged and supported, if that can be done. The taxi sector is under serious threat in terms of its existence. The Minister of State mentioned a lot of figures regarding the cost of insurance, as did my colleagues. We have all had cases raised with us at our offices. What I learned from the hearings is that there is a cartel-type activity going on between the insurance companies. For example, only two or three companies will quote people in the taxi business and such quotes are excessive and not sustainable. When it comes to the insurance companies - the blue books from the Central Bank - as rightly said by Deputy Mick Barry, the insurance companies made €3.1 billion in profits from 2001 to 2012 compared with a loss of only €330 million in 2013-2014. The pattern for them as far as profitability is concerned has been massively on the increase, with some blips along the way, but they would expect that. The insurance companies would have that factored in. What Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier is true, namely, by comparison with the profits that are being made, the people in need of insurance are being squeezed so much they cannot take any more. As I said earlier, the Central Bank was asleep on duty in terms of regulating and protecting consumer rights. That is why I emphasised in my contribution the need for that protection to be extended and to be robust. That is a must in terms of anything that happens. Rural proofing is necessary. People who live in rural areas are faced with huge difficulties in terms of having no access to public transport nor being able to afford taxis for hospital appointments and so on. Now they cannot afford insurance. As stated by Deputy Mattie McGrath, even when a person over 70 years of age has a clear medical report, the insurance companies still will not insure him or her. In the context of the timelines to which the Minister of State referred, there may be issues he can deal with that will immediately affect the premiums for those sectors that are under so much pressure, for example, the taxi sector. The Irish Road Haulage Association appeared before the committee. Its representatives pointed out that if its members can get re-registered elsewhere in Europe or if they can get re-flagging, they move out of Ireland and the loss to this country per truck is €250,000. How can we as a country sustain that? What we need is a single insurance market. The Irish Road Haulage Association representative, Ms Verona Murphy, made great sense. She pointed out the issues. As in the case of the individuals who are affected by premiums, the organisations that represent the bigger groups that are able to articulate their argument better have so much common sense to put forward. All they are asking for is for the Minister of State to take the action that is necessary. The Minister of State told me this morning in relation to the European directive that it takes time for that to be teased out and so on. While that is happening, according to Ms Murphy on behalf of the Irish Road Haulage Association, businesses are going bust. They cannot take any more. I know from my background in the haulage business that there is very little mark-up in it. Businesses are trading on a wing and prayer. If we do not do something about the SME sector, including the taxi sector, businesses will not be with us. All of this is affecting our possibilities in terms of our economic development and in terms of the social effect it is having not only in cities but also in rural Ireland. As I said earlier, the timeline is crucial. In terms of the profitability of insurance companies, I do not mind business making a profit once it does not do so on the back of a cartel or citizens being screwed. Something has to change. The Minister of State referenced the awards. We are always told by the insurance companies that the reason for the increase in premiums is the level and number of awards. I referred earlier to the profits being made by the industry. In 2013, the average award was €21,730. In 2016, the average award was €21,782 which means nothing has changed. The insurance industry's argument does not stand up. The argument around profitability does not stand up. The Central Bank should have been working with the industry so that there was no road bump in terms of costs. We should have had regulation and clearer understanding of premiums and we should have brought the public with us over the past seven years, but that did not happen. I do not accept Deputy Mick Barry's argument about the information provided in the report. Deputy Boyd Barrett might pass on to him the point that there is nothing buried in the depths of the report. It is a report that has been supported by socialists and others alike. It is a report unanimously accepted by the committee. The information is not buried; it is in the report. I do not mind criticism but we all need to work in a constructive way to get the report right. On legislation and the EU directive, the Minister of State must do something to speed up that process. Other members referred to legislation that was passed, parts of which have not been enacted and in which recommendations have been made but not implemented. It is in that context that the Minister of State should be ensuring tighter timelines. I referred earlier to the committee's officials, the excellent work they did, their professionalism and so on. The witness who struck a chord with me and others in terms of how forthright she was in the description of what is going on in this industry is Ms Dorothea Dowling. She has been a voice in this area for a long time. She reminds me of John the Baptist but she has not lost her head yet. She gives a true picture of the insurance business and does a good job. I encourage the Minister of State to bring forward the timelines to try to decrease the cost of insurance. I know he wants to manage expectations but perhaps we should examine the expectations of the insurance industry. It expects us to continue to protect it and to not acknowledge that it is a cartel.Let us turn the tables on them and ensure they now feel the pinch from us, the elected representatives who represent the people.

He referred to the Business Committee and the request to have a debate on both of these reports. It was the decision of the Business Committee initially that both reports would be considered this evening. It was also the decision that if additional time was required, the Business Committee would favourably consider that in order that the reports could be considered further.
