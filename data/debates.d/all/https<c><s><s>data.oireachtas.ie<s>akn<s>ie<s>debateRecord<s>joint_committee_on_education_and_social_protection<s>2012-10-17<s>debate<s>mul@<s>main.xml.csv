Today, we are considering that policy goal and initiatives in the Department to review community employment schemes.  I welcome our guests from the Department of Social Protection to discuss the matter with us.  When they conclude we will have a separate presentation from SIPTU.  I welcome Mr. Oliver Egan, assistant secretary of the information services division; Ms Mary Donnelly, principal officer of the employment support division; Mr. T.J. Fleming, principal officer of the project office; and Mr. John Lee, assistant principal in the employment support division.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Mr. Egan to make his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	1	I am accompanied by Ms Mary Donnelly, who has responsibility for community employment and JI; Mr. T.J. Fleming who is the principal officer based in Tubbercurry with responsibility for RSS, Tús and CSP; and Mr. John Lee, who is assistant principal reporting to Ms Donnelly on community employment and is one of our accountants.  The committee has invited us here to discuss how unemployment can be minimised and the roles community employment and the other schemes can play in supporting people in getting back to work.  Pathways to Work sets out to improve how the State engages with and supports the unemployed to get back into the workforce.  It is being delivered alongside the measures in the Government’s action plan on jobs to help create new employment opportunities.  The approach set out in Pathways to Work is designed to build on existing Government policies to ensure that as many new job opportunities as possible are filled by those on the live register.  The challenge in Pathways to Work is to ensure that the creation of new jobs results in a reduction in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment so that individuals do not become permanently disenfranchised within our society.  The Department of Social Protection is engaged with the delivery of income support payments, activation of those of working age and the control of fraud and abuse of the system.  On activation, the aim of the Department is to engage with every unemployed individual to ensure that his or her first day out of work is also the first step on the pathway back to work.  Future funding of employment programmes, particularly community employment, will reinforce the key objectives required by the Department as outlined earlier.  This requires a more focused engagement with people on programmes such as CE and greater targeting of activation places and opportunities to further the progression of unemployed people into work.  Community employment is one of a number of employment schemes managed by the Department of Social Protection.  Other smaller programmes that are similar in many respects to community employment are the rural social scheme, the community services programme, job initiative and Tús.  Members of the committee have been furnished with a copy of the financial review of CE schemes.  Therefore, I will not go into the background and the main features of CE in detail although I am very happy to take questions on the review.  I will, however, point to a number of key areas that I feel are pertinent to the committee.  In addition, I will make reference to the other schemes already mentioned.  Over the years CE has become a vital service to communities in remote rural areas and areas of urban disadvantage.  It has developed into a somewhat unique programme that integrates employment interventions and training for the individual with community services.  It is the largest labour market activation programme in Ireland.  The 2012 budget for CE is approximately €340 million and the programme has 23,300 places, including approximately 1,400 supervisors.  Some 1,136 CE schemes throughout the country provide a wide range of social services to local communities.  A key function of CE is supporting social inclusion and counteracting the drift into long-term unemployment.  The programme is targeted in the main at people over 25 who are long-term unemployed and very distant from the labour market.  Participants on CE are in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a minimum period of one year and include people on the live register, lone parents and people with a disability.  Within these categories there are participants associated with long-term disadvantage such as ex-offenders, people with drug dependency and people from the Traveller community.  CE is a broad and flexible programme that has been utilised to address many social challenges presenting at individual or societal level such as rehabilitative programmes and supporting communities in the provision of services.  Many new entrants to CE come from a background of educational disadvantage.  Just over half of new entrants to CE have a qualification of no higher than junior certificate.  Of these, one in five had only primary level education or no record of achievement.  Males on the programme tend to have lower education attainment than females.  In 2011, more than 37,000 components of learning were completed by CE participants and nearly 17,000 of these were accredited by FETAC under the national framework of qualifications as minor awards.  Approximately one quarter of CE participants are between 25 and 35 years with more than half aged 45 or older.  This programme is predominantly focused on older, low-skilled jobseekers and requires a different type of environment from other programmes - one that supports and understands the adult learner.  I have said CE has had two main objectives: to help the long-term unemployed gain employment and to support organisations in providing services to communities.  This dual mandate can lead sponsors to be over-focused on the service provision sometimes to the detriment of the progression of the job seeker.  The primary focus of the Department for the CE participant is to assist them in gaining the skills and work experience to enable them to enter paid employment.  Of those who left CE in 2011, we estimate that 19% went into employment and a further 7% went onto further education.  Given the current economic environment and taking into account the profile of participants, this can be considered a relatively positive outcome.  The Department is conducting a policy review of the effectiveness of its full range of employment support programmes.  The outcome of this review will help determine future policy with regard to the role and appropriate scale of many of these activation programmes.  Ultimately, of course, decisions in this area are a matter for the Minister and the Government.  The Department is committed to reforming community employment to ensure progression of the individual, support for the sponsor in the delivery of service and value for money for the State.  I will now deal with some of the other smaller programmes.  The rural social scheme supplements the incomes of those engaged in small-scale farming or fishing and who are in receipt of or have an entitlement to social welfare payments.  The scheme gives participants the opportunity to engage on a part-time basis in providing services of benefit to their local communities.  There is no expectation of further progression and no training requirement other than that related to compliance issues and health and safety.  Current participation is capped at 2,600 places with 130 supervisors and a budget of approximately €45.6 million.  The community services programme supports the provision of services by community organisations.  Currently the programme supports approximately 2,800 employees directly and another 800 to 900 indirectly in 423 not-for-profit companies and small co-operatives.  The community companies supported are required to generate a significant level of their resources from the delivery of services by charging fees or selling goods and services.  Grant levels as a proportion of turnover in the companies vary from approximately 15% to 85%.  The 2012 budget is €45.4 million.  The job initiative scheme was launched in 1996 and initially provided three years' full-time employment for people who, on entry to the scheme, were 35 years of age or over, unemployed for five years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.  Further entry to the scheme was suspended in 2004 when those already on the programme were given the right to remain on the scheme indefinitely.  Its main purpose was to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities.  This was achieved by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The job initiative has 1,176 participants operating on a full-time basis with a budget of €27.1 million.    Tús, which is the most recent of these initiatives, aims to provide short term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed and to provide certain services of benefit to communities.  The programme was announced in the budget in December 2010 and became operational in the middle of 2011.  Participants are placed with local community organisations to provide resources to maintain and improve local amenities and facilities in rural and urban communities with inputs being funded either by Tús itself or through local community fund-raising or other income.Communities, in turn, benefit from the talent of local people with a diverse repertoire of skills and abilities. More specialist tasks may require training and upskilling which is undertaken by the implementing body. Tús has 4,675 participants, of whom 243 are supervisors. The 2012 budget is €84 million. For the first time, all of these programmes come under the Department of Social Protection. Previously, they were spread across different agencies and Departments. We have commenced a process of reforming the community employment scheme. We have identified where considerable savings can be secured and entered into detailed debates with the local sponsors and community groups. That engagement has been enriching. In 2013 we are hoping to improve the quality and effectiveness of the placement programmes. We are hoping to align the community employment, Tús, JI and RSS programmes more closely, improve value for money and ensure they secure the achievement of the objectives set out in Pathways to Work and that programmes are clearly activation focused or aiming at the provision of community support. I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to make this presentation. My team and I will be happy to answer questions from members.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	3	The previous budget required a reduction in the materials and training provision under the community employment scheme from approximately €24 million to €11 million.  This led to considerable pressure in the earlier part of the year.  As an interim measure, in the spring we guaranteed that no scheme would close while the review was ongoing.  Subsequently, our teams around the country engaged in a series of detailed meetings and reviews with various community groups.  The result was that, ultimately, additional funding was provided and the materials and training budget for this year is now approximately €20.5 million.  This has addressed the issues from our perspective.  We have built in a review mechanism to allow sponsors who believed they had a difficulty in their funding position to make an appeal.  To date, about 12 appeals have been made in total and no sponsors of whom we are aware have had to cease owing to financial pressures.  That is not to say, however, that there is not a need for greater efficiency and to put greater pressures on individuals.  There is obviously pressure, but we believe the funding issue has largely been dealt with to the satisfaction of sponsors.

Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an plé seo á dhéanamh againn sula dtagann an tuairisc chun cinn.  It is important that we have this discussion, I hope, before finalisation of the policy report and that we have some input or that the views expressed today will have a bearing on what will be presented.  In a way, it is pity that it has taken this length of time, but it is important that we get the community employment scheme correct.  There has been a debate for a long time about the role of community employment.  It is good to see that there is an acknowledgement of its two roles - to help the long-term unemployed to gain employment and to support organisations in providing services for communities.  Often the second role is forgotten.  It appears that it is forgotten by some of the Department's staff who are dealing with community employment programmes and appear to be continuously harassing some of the programmes in my constituency with regard to progression and so forth.  Perhaps Mr. Egan might remind staff who are dealing with community employment programmes which are struggling with issues I will outline shortly that one of the primary roles of the scheme in many cases is to support organisations providing services for communities.  I received replies to two parliamentary questions from the Minister yesterday.  Perhaps Mr. Egan might elaborate on them.  I asked that consideration be given to extending eligibility to people under 25 years of age.  The reason is the huge growth in the level of youth unemployment in recent years.  This group is not being captured by any similar scheme which can guarantee them additional employment and a work placement where they are not being exploited.  In the other question I asked that consideration be given to extending the availability of extensions.  In the past the community employment scheme was available to a number of people for two and three years to ensure they could progress at the other end.  Mr. Egan states in his presentation that last year 19% entered employment and that a further 7% went into further education.  He has correctly pointed out, given the context, that this is very good.  However, it also proves the need in many cases for an additional year.  According to the reply I received yesterday, the extra year is restricted to 10%; therefore, it is not available to many people who need an extra year or even six months to complete a training course.  I urge that greater consideration be given to this aspect.  That is one of the key points to emerged from the discussions I have had with community employment groups in my constituency, in which there is a concentration of special programmes supporting child care facilities.  The budget and the timeframe, particularly in the case of child care services, do not allow people to gain the proper qualification to move on to the private sector or elsewhere.  There are two issues involved.  First, the time is not available to many of them anymore and, second, the budget cut announced earlier this year and confirmed with a slight change in the recent report is still substantial in the case of training and materials.  The alternative is Tús, for which there is no training budget.  This means that those who wish to follow a specific path of training and working in that environment have no options.  I have a number of other questions, but I will leave it at that for now in order that other members can ask their questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	7	To put the matter in context, the labour market activation review is nearing completion.  Perhaps I might give the Deputy a flavour of the issues we are discussing, bearing in mind that we have not yet reached firm conclusions.  We hope the report will be finalised in the next number of weeks and that we can publish it thereafter.  The issues we are examining in the activation review include how to make the range of programmes for which my colleagues and I have responsibility more effective in the context of labour market progression.  We are extremely conscious of doing this in a way that protects the services provided for community groups and the vital services provided.  It can be a difficult balancing act to get the mixture right and it is taking us a little time to work through it.  The way we see the community employment scheme working as we move forward is that an individual learning plan, about which my colleague, Ms Donnelly will talk, will be carried out with each individual when they join.  It will identify those people who can work through the programme and move on with one year's experience and the individuals who might need a longer term progression which we would allow to happen within the parameters of our budget line.  We are conscious of the need to cater for both sides in that regard.  As the Deputy said, there is a 10% figure.  That procedure has been in place for a number of years.  We would like to improve on it to make it more focused on the individual and help him or her to secure progression.  We are conscious of the need for continuity of service, particularly in the health care area and programmes dealing with disability, drugs and so forth, and to balance the progression of an individual against the need of the community group to continue the service.  Ms Donnelly will talk about this aspect in greater detail.  We are carrying out a detailed review of child care.We are doing a detailed review. We are preparing a paper with our Civil Service colleagues on the provision of child care and how it can be dealt with in a way that addresses the needs of the child care groups and give them the opportunity of progression. My colleague Ms Mary Donnelly, will develop these points.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	8	The Deputy tabled a question on those under 25 years and received a response.  There is a balance to be struck in the allocation of community employment places.  We have a large cohort of long-term unemployed people.  Community employment schemes were designed to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed.  Other programmes were designed to cater for people under 25 years.  The Department of Education and Skills has a wide range of programmes.  For example, Youthreach was designed for disadvantaged young people who missed out on education.  When consideration was given to extending community employment schemes we focused on learning.  People on the scheme would undertake significant pieces of learning and get the opportunity to complete that learning while they are on the programme.  If they have completed their time on the scheme, it is important the sponsor examines whether they can continue their education through evening programmes or programmes devised by the Department of Education and Skills and provided through the VEC.  That is an option.  We are most anxious that people will be able to complete their qualifications.  The one year or three years is available for people who need considerably longer to complete their course.  The three year programme can be extended to four years in certain instances.  If the participants are engaged fully, for example if they were referred through employment services where they have identified their needs in an accurate way and that matches the needs of the individual, they already would have a portfolio of learning that needs to be completed.  That needs to be taken up by the scheme sponsor and by the community employment supervisor and implemented.  I note the point made by the Deputy on the reduction in the training grant and the importance of this training for people on schemes.  We are mindful of that and the Minister has increased the allocation announced in the budget in 2012 by €1.3 million.  We know that further provision is necessary and we have entered into detailed discussions with the Department of Education and Skills, in particular with the VECs on how they can provide those training and educational services to participants on community employment at no cost to the individual scheme or to the programme.  We have advanced discussions with the VEC in the Dublin region.  We are very aware that the VEC is very active in the Deputy's area in providing training and education.  The City of Dublin VEC has agreed to provide a range of programmes that are very much tailored to the needs of people on community employment, in particular literacy, numeracy, communications and child care.  We are looking to establish the primary needs of schemes in the Dublin area with a view to matching that up with what the VEC can provide.  That will be supplemented by the budget that each project has for training.  On the question of child care, we have entered into detailed discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Community employment is a very important support for the provision of child care services in communities.  The very clear message we are getting from the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs is that when participants come in to take up a place on a community employment scheme it is very important that they enter into a whole programme of learning and than when they leave they have a qualification in child care that is now regarded by the sector at Fetac level 5.  It is very important that they have a given provision to undertake that learning while on the programme.  We are looking at the child care stream to see how we can make a streamlined experience for the learner on community employment so that they come in, they already have a career plan and are very clear they want to have a profession in child care. They work in a quality child care project, they get the mentoring and support from the community employment supervisor in their learning and they attend the VEC for their child care programme or some other provider.  That can be funded by the Department of Social Protection under the budget that is available or it can be funded and supported by the VEC.  We are very adamant that this is a very important development in terms of community employment.  I have had discussions with some community employment child care schemes and the county child care committees as well as officials in the Department.

I wished to be present for this vitally important debate and contribute some ideas.  The community employment scheme has been one of the most significant interventions in social policy in the past 30 to 40 years.  It has been able to balance individual advancement with the provision of community services, which is extraordinary.  That intervention has been severely weakened in recent times.  We go down that road at our peril.  We lose out on both aspects.  We lose in terms of the delivery of community services and the advancement of the individual.  We must pull back from that.  We must recognise the value and the values of community employment in its fullness.  In that regard, I think the Department has listened too intently to the ESRI, a body which is no fan of community employment schemes.  In letters to the Minister I have been urging her to look at the work of two young academics from UCD, who have come to different conclusions about how the balances can be adhered to without damaging either community services or individual advancement.  The ESRI is quite hostile to community employment in its twin objectives.  That advice, so-called, should be cast aside.  I cannot understand that the thorough work done by the two UCD academics has not been taken on board completely.  We must take stock of developments before we go too far and do irretrievable damage to communities that have no other way of keeping community halls open, services in schools - - - - -

We are in a position to stake stock and we should do that before the scheme is irretrievably damaged.  I welcome the campaign by SIPTU on community employment schemes.  In its vision, community employment is a social policy intervention, which it wanted restored.  That was its role and it can be again.  We must not cross this mark of diminishing it and taking away some of its dynamic qualities.  I had a number of meeting with the Minister and the chief executive officer of the City of Dublin VEC.  I have been putting forward the idea that for many people taking up a place on a community employment schemes might be their only chance to experience education and training.  I was not always happy about some of the private providers.  It is very important that the VEC, which has a tradition of more than 100 years in the city of providing education and training, plays a role in community employment.  It is a credible body that can stand over training and education and will give a profile to the community employment schemes that offer reassurance of their quality. Everyone knows about the VEC. Its schools are in every community. People know it has credibility. I welcome that. I have had a number of meetings with the Minister and the chief executive of the City of Dublin VEC about the importance of bringing the VEC into the centre of community employment. I will conclude by emphasising that we must halt the drift towards the weakening of this provision. Individuals and communities will suffer if we do not. Neither of them deserves to suffer.

I am sorry for being late.  I am rushing to the Seanad.  I would like to endorse much of what Deputy Conaghan has just said.  I am hugely impressed with the very broad range of work that is being carried out under community employment schemes throughout the country.  I am from Galway.  A recent event in the Shantalla area of the city brought all of the community employment schemes in the locality together.  I thought that was very wise on their part.  One would be hugely embarrassed if one could not give them all time.  The work they are doing is incredible.  Everything is community-based, which needs to be a cornerstone of our efforts to keep our communities and our society together.  Work is taking place in areas like mental health, child care and social work.  There is a huge range of heritage work going on.  I was impressed by the commitment of the group.  Some of those who would never have bought into learning if it had not been a requirement of the scheme are now doing so.  I was also impressed by the professionalism of the co-ordinator of the scheme, who is inculcating planning and teamwork among those involved.  There should be no cutbacks in community employment schemes.  I will make that point to the Minister when the Seanad debates social welfare on Thursday.  Any cuts in this area would represent a very poor economy.  It would represent a huge level of stupidity at this time, when we want people to engage with their communities.  Not only are those involved doing good work in the mental health area, but they are also improving their own mental health, which can be at risk at times of unemployment.  I agree with Deputy Conaghan that the ESRI would do well to do qualitative work-----

I would like to ask two questions about these schemes, which are minimising unemployment.  One of the officials said that the training grant has been increased by €1.3 million since last year's budget.  Is that correct?  What feedback has the Department received from the groups on that?  How do they find it?  When it was broken down across the groups, did they find it adequate?  What options do individuals have when they come off these schemes after three years?  It has been pointed out that they might have an option of a fourth year in some cases.  People have to come to see me to tell me they suddenly needed anti-depressants because they had withdrawal symptoms when their schemes ran out.  I would like to hear what the officials have to say about that.  At the end of the day, this represents good financial value, based on the outputs and the added value to communities.  How would it make sense to cut it back?  I would appreciate the thoughts of the officials.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	21	I have taken note of the points that have been made.  I will first deal with the point that was made about the level of the grant on the training side.  As I mentioned earlier, the original cutback would have been from €24 million to €11 million.  The funding for materials and training increased to €20.5 million.  That came from a combination of national training fund moneys and Department of Social Protection resources.  Training is adequately funded this year.  We know that an under-spend will probably occur this year.  One of the unfortunate side effects of the debate that took place earlier this year was that training was deferred because there was a feeling that there would be insufficient funds.  When funds are made available later in the year, it is harder for sponsors and individuals to organise the provision of training.  We will certainly have adequate funding this year.  We will face a challenge in the future to build strategic relationships with the VECs, to link into SOLAS, to get the necessary training provided within the totality of the envelope available to the Exchequer and to ensure we are getting the best value for money.  That is what we are focused on.  Ms Donnelly mentioned the ongoing discussions with the VECs on the establishment of proper memorandums of understanding at local level.

We are working hard to ensure the training budget is spent this year.  The reality is that an under-spend in the earlier part of the year has been carried forward into the second half of the year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	25	No.  It is within the budget envelope for this year.  We have eased our own rules on that to try to help as much as we can.  We will do as much as we can to ensure funding is spent in the right way this year within the ILP and within recognised progression.  The key point is that funding for the rest of this year is not a challenge for us.  We have an adequate fund for training.  We will encourage the sponsors.  We have met some of the groups already to say there is funding available.  In the future, we will have to ensure we arrange the funding in a clearer way.  The relationships with the educational bodies will have to be clear.  We will all have to understand what we are doing.  We are confident we can do that.  The VEC systems of further training and development will need to have clear routes of progression.  That is what Ms Donnelly and her colleagues have been working on.  The Department of Social Protection is working on the activation agenda generally to ensure progression opportunities exist when people avail of the services of Pathways to Work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	27	We would hope that people would have completed a body of training, and might be ready for the job market, when the this runs out.

Does he consider that these people, having been part of a community-supported system, would have achieved enough learning outcomes to upskill and ready themselves for a new market?  Does he agree that it might be necessary for continued forms of community support schemes to have a role throughout the lives of individuals who might be quite advanced in age?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	29	Some 23,300 people are participating in the scheme.  It is a very broad church.  We have been set a target under Pathways to Work of ensuring a certain number of those places are one-year activation programmes.  That will allow us to continue to secure as many activation places as possible.  We are all probably aware that one of the problems with the scheme was that people tended to stay on them for a long number of years, which meant that other people did not have opportunities to avail of it.  We have to balance that with securing progression opportunities for people who have longer-term needs.  We are very aware of Deputy Conaghan's point about the need to support community groups and individuals as part of the activation agenda.  We are trying to balance that within the totality of the programmes we have.  As a group, the task we face involves bringing together the best of the community employment scheme, Tús, the rural social scheme and the job initiative scheme in a new way that helps people to make progress.  That is the type of thing we are looking at within the labour market activation review.

The ESRI does not seem to have considered the scheme in the context of its original intention.  It seems to have a very narrow focus.  Does Mr. Egan have any comments on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	31	Various studies have been done by the ESRI, the OECD and the IMF.  They have largely focused on the effectiveness of the scheme from the perspective of labour market activation.  The scheme was originally designed as a labour market activation measure.  Although we have achieved success on those broad measures, as I mentioned earlier, we would have striven for a better level of success.  Over the last year, we have formally recognised that it is much more complex than that.  It is both an activation mechanism and a community support mechanism.  We are trying to balance that within the review that is taking place at the moment.  We are trying to find the right mix in terms of activation and community support.  We are aware of the dual function that this scheme fulfils.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	32	I welcome the delegation and acknowledge the important role community employment has played in enhancing the environment.  I come from a county which has won three national awards in the Tidy Towns competition, none of which would have been achieved without the input of community employment schemes.  This year, Abbeyshrule won a national and European award.  We will have a civic reception for participants in the local community employment scheme, many of them volunteers, who helped bring the village to where it is today.  The reduction last year in the value of the materials grant for community employment caused a major outcry.  Any further cuts would have a devastating effect on community employment schemes.  I plead with the officials to ensure no further cuts are included in the upcoming budget.  We must not lose sight of the fact that the sponsors of community employment schemes are volunteers who do not receive any rewards, financial or otherwise, except the support of their respective communities.  They give their time to establish and manage community employment schemes that provide major benefits to local communities.  For example, community employment has helped rejuvenate the tourism industry through improvements to heritage sites and so forth.  The rural social scheme also delivers major social benefits.  Small farmers, in particular, many of whom are isolated in their communities, are brought together and linked in to their local community.   Community employment schemes and State and semi-State bodies, such as Waterways Ireland and the Office of Public Works, should link up and co-operate more.  Waterways Ireland has done extensive work on re-opening the Royal Canal from Dublin to the River Shannon.  I am fond of walking different stretches of the canal from time to time and I have noted significant deficits along the route, for example, areas where walkers must traverse soft bogland.  Under an arterial drainage scheme carried out in the mid-1960s, a large amount of spoil was taken from the River Inney and left on the river bank.  This continues to damage farmland and farmers have indicated to me that they would welcome its removal to be placed along soft areas of the canal towpaths.  Such an initiative should be considered under the rural social scheme.  It is only one of many examples of work that could be done under the scheme.  Community employment schemes did not play a role in the re-opening of the canal which proved to be a major community asset.  Much more needs to be done to conserve heritage sites along the banks of the Royal Canal.  This issue should be examined to ensure heritage is placed on the map.  Local knowledge about townlands and folklore has been passed down through the generations and should be utilised.  The folklore of local areas could be collected as part of a tourism project.  I refer not only to the canals but several other areas where work of this nature could be done.   As I noted, any further cuts in the value of material grants would have a devastating effect.  We must remember that the sponsors are volunteers who work full-time elsewhere.  They have come together to establish a scheme and the only benefit they receive is a sense of pride in their community.

Community employment schemes have been operating for a long time.  I participated in a social employment scheme in the early 1990s when I was around 25 years at the time.  Restrictions did not apply at that stage.  Unlike the JobBridge scheme, community employment schemes have access to extensive experience and an established structure.  I do not know what is the position in respect of the Tús scheme.  If the Department moves towards aligning the various schemes, will it avail of the extensive experience acquired by supervisors on the community employment schemes who have moved into areas such as FETAC awards?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	34	We meet regularly with supervisors, ICTU representatives and other representative groups.  We regard the supervisors and sponsors as partners in this process and work with them.  In short, we value their experience.  One of the benefits last year brought was a re-energising of the engagement between our staff at local level and supervisors.  Much good can come of this and we expect to work with and engage supervisors in any future discussions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	36	Mr. Fleming will respond to some of the points raised regarding the Tús and rural social schemes.  We are conscious that the schemes are separate and supervisors on both schemes have differing roles and remuneration packages and must meet different requirements.  To correct an earlier remark I made, I inadvertently stated that last year's budget was €24.5 million when it was €29.4 million.  The budget this year is €20.4 million.  Mr. Fleming will comment on some of the issues raised regarding the rural social scheme and Tús, after which we will return to the supervisory issue.  While the programmes are similar, they also differ in some respects. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	37	Deputy Bannon referred to the possibility of the rural social scheme co-ordinating work on the canals with Waterways Ireland and the Office of Public Works.  There is nothing preventing this type of work from being undertaken.  The manner in which this could be done is largely related to the current commitments by the company which manages the resources scheme in County Longford or along the Royal Canal.  We had discussions recently with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on issues such as concentrating on rural recreation, supporting the development of upland walkways and trails and using the resources available under Tús or the rural social scheme to support plans in that area.  Ideally, the Department would like such plans to be developed locally under the auspices of the agencies with responsibility for this matter.  The Department could then bring the labour content to any such plans.  While it is not the Department's responsibility to set out plans in respect of heritage sites or issues such as the restoration of the canal network, we would be open to encouraging such initiatives.  Our rules clearly set out that in developing work plans the local development companies should consult State agencies operating in the relevant area to identify priorities in terms of areas where they wish development to take place.  At the same time, however, we must avoid displacement of the permanent staff of the Office of Public Works or Waterways Ireland.  The schemes must work in a complementary fashion.

The Department does not have any particular difficulty in working in a partnership of that nature or encouraging the local development companies, which are local managers of the schemes, to work within that type of a plan.In terms of working within a fixed budget, the workforce in the rural resource scheme is limited to 2,600 nationally. I can check the number in Longford.

In working within those quotas, something is  possible but it may mean that resources are being moved from existing work to an area of work as suggested by the Deputy.  It is certainly not impossible.

Is there a system in place where one person could supervise the CE scheme and the rural social scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	43	CE schemes are structured separately and the local community sponsor them and as Mr. Oliver Egan mentioned, there are roughly 400 of those schemes.  Perhaps he would correct me if my interpretation of how CE works is work, but effectively the contribution is to the community organisation to employ the supervisor who manages the work of the organisation, the progression and the individual learning plans of the participant.  The supervisors of the rural social scheme - there are fewer of them as it is a smaller scheme - are employees of the local development companies.  Their role is to deliver a range of work over numerous community bodies.  It is not just a single body.  Whether employed by the sponsoring local development company in the country the work is delivered across a range of community bodies, it is not necessarily dedicated to a particular community body in that the work of a participant on the RSS can extend across a range of bodies and a range of work during the course of a year.  It also takes into account their farming activities.  For example, they may work longer hours in winter time on the rural social scheme and shorter hours during the summer.  I am not sure whether they had a shorter time on the farm this summer but generally it suits the social aspect of the smaller farmer.

I will not go over the community employment scheme as I know my colleagues have stressed its importance and value to local communities and particularly the value of the rural social scheme to rural communities.  However, I wish to highlight its value to people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities who never left the home until they started on a community employment scheme.  One cannot put a monetary value on it because it has enhanced their lives, it means they are getting out and meeting people.  The supervisors on the community employment and rural social schemes are understanding of their needs and give them the work they are capable of doing.  That is invaluable.  I know the representatives will say the Employ Ability Service is in place for people with disabilities for employers but many of these people could not hold down a day job.  The community employment schemes are invaluable to them.  I ask the representatives to take into consideration those with intellectual disabilities and seek to have the duration of the scheme extended.  A participant may get one year, three years and, sometimes, six years.  Perhaps that aspect could be taken on board when making decisions.

We have had people over here from Scotland speaking about the social economy there and the huge contribution it was making to employment and personal development in that country.  I do not want a direct answer but I would like some strategic thinking across three or four Departments about the potential of the social economy and to see the CE projects as a foundation stone upon which to build a much more dynamic social economy.  Ireland is way behind in that respect.  Perhaps that is an issue to which we could return in the future and to see how, compared to other countries, we can get our social economy on a much more secure footing, to enable it deliver the opportunities that are sorely required.

It is a huge area and it is important that we get it right and do not further exacerbate the problems.  How are we to going to address the issue of recruitment for many child care schemes, particularly those catering for people with a disability?  A figure I was given by Citywide indicated an 84% drop in applications since the budgetary change which did away with the secondary benefits which applied to that category.  Given that the numbers applying are limited the existence of some the child care facilities are threatened.  That is a major challenge.  Mr. Egan mentioned the effects of training and materials grant on schemes.  In many cases we are getting services on the cheap that should be provided by the State but that is a policy decision.  It works out at approximately €1,000 per person.  The cost of a FETAC level 5 course in child care is approximately €700.  That means the budget is virtually gone for the participant and one is left with only €300 for a year or a year and a half.  Has consideration been given to increasing the numbers?  I realise that at the end of the day, the decision rests with the Minister.  There are 180,000 long-term unemployed people, many of whom are five or six years unemployed by the time they reach 25 years of age but there are only 23,000 places.  In a comment or a contribution it was indicated that there is a concentration on throughput rather than results, that there is a need to get as many people on to community employment as possible.  That is fine but if there are not results the only way is to hold them until the progression is guaranteed and to get more people on the scheme, which means increasing the numbers rather than a faster throughput.  I wish we had more time to debate the issue.  I welcome the financial review which has much to do with the management.  For those of us who were on CE sponsor groups in the past, there are major questions in respect of the pressures on CE to get sponsors because of the additional liabilities, given that some are incorporated.  Has there been any movement since the review, in respect of pooling of insurance costs across the board and contractors of IT suppliers and stationery being allowed to purchase for five, six or more schemes?  Last week we had a discussion on schools where a similar issue arose.Audits were mentioned and they are a significant cost. Most of these schemes do not bring in money as most of the money goes on training and materials. Therefore, a cost of €1,000 for audit is substantial and can be the difference between survival or not surviving.

I now invite Mr. Egan to make his concluding remarks and to respond to the questions.  Deputy Conaghan asked about the social economy, Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about numbers and the pooling of purchases and child care provisions and Senator Moloney raised the issue of disability.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	50	I will be as quick as I can and hopefully I will cover all the points.  On disability, approximately 14.3% of the participants would be classified as having a disability, quite a significant cadre.  This changes around a little, but generally stays at that level.  We have complex restructuring to do on this because we are very aware of the multiplicity of outcomes from this programme and the various levels for whom it tries to provide.  We are trying to be as nuanced as we can be.  That is one of the reasons for the delay in the completion of the labour market activation review as we are trying to get the weightings of the various factors correct.  With regard to the numbers on the scheme, currently there are 22,726 people on it, including supervisors.  I mention this because in the context of the point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, we are conscious of a change in the constitution of those numbers.  The numbers represented by single parents would be down at 14.4%, whereas it was higher a few months ago at 20%.  The numbers are still coming through in overall terms, but the mix is changing significantly.  We are conscious of that and of the difference that makes in terms of the scheme.  With regard to the social economy, Mr. Fleming works with me on the community services programme, CSP, and we think some elements of CE should be looked at within CSP.  We are conscious of the potential power within that with regard to the social economy.  We are looking at this to see what we can do within the schemes to point them in the right direction and to help community enterprise generally.  Mr. Fleming is part of the team as we work towards that.  We can give further detail on this if required.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned savings.  We stated in our report that we think we can save approximately €3.5 million in a full year.  This will be achieved through obtaining better value on insurance, which we have been getting, looking at the audit requirements and seeking better value there, and looking at pooling expenditure in a more efficient way.  We have achieved considerable savings this year already and believe the potential is there for more next year.  Again, this must be nuanced and we are conscious of the need to make the rules easier to follow.  We have relaxed the necessity around different bank accounts this year to try to help sponsors in that regard.  We hope, in our ongoing discussions with sponsors and supervisors, to take on board further ideas on how to improve the situation. Without getting into policy areas which have yet to be decided, next year we hope to get greater alignment between the various community schemes the team here represents, secure better outcomes for individual learners and, at the same time, maintain and, where possible, improve services to community groups.  This is a hard ask within a pot of money which is less than it was a number of years ago and if we are do it we must ensure we work very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and elsewhere to get the best value we can on training, education and preventions.  We must also analyse what we are doing critically and objectively to see whether we can do it better, while taking on board the views of those with home we deal.  I hope I have dealt with all the points raised.  We are available afterwards if anybody wants to contact us and would welcome that.  Department of Social Protection colleagues in the individual regions are also available.  We would be pleased to hear from members afterwards, either by e-mail, phone call or direct contact and will take on board any concerns they may have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	53	I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for agreeing to hear our presentation on the challenges facing community employment schemes and the future direction of community employment.  On my right is Mr. David Connolly, community representative on the NEC of SIPTU, next is Ms Doreen O'Connor, a child care worker, Mr. Briscoe, a CE supervisor.  I will give a brief overview of community employment.  It is Ireland's principal labour market programme, with the aim of enhancing the employability and mobility of the long term unemployed by providing employment opportunities for them in their communities.  It aims to facilitate them to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment.  In addition, it assists them to develop both their technical and personal skills which can be used in the workplace.  Community employment involves a part-time work placement with an employer or sponsor in a community based setting and operates in both urban and rural areas of disadvantage.  It is by far the biggest programmes of its kind in Ireland.  There are approximately 23,300 CE workers carrying out valuable work in communities all around the country.  There are currently 1,123 CE programmes in operation.  Community employment also provides a range of vital community services.   Community employment is an effective means of addressing long-term unemployment by providing accessible and appropriate opportunities for employment and training.  Through participation in community employment in a supported community based environment, CE workers can regain confidence and acquire new skills to help them re-enter the active labour marker.  It also plays an important role in helping to realise equality and inclusion for many who find themselves disadvantaged.  Participation on CE is drawn from the live register and, consequently, often represents those at greater risk of marginalisation from society, work and learning.  In evaluating CE, it has been noted that CE schemes have had a number of attractions for disadvantaged groups such as lone parents, including flexibility, a strong social dimension and service orientated work. The personal gains for participants, such as increased social interaction and integration, growth in self-confidence and self-esteem, and the holistic development of the individual, have also been acknowledged. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis by Fitzpatrick Associates in 1995 found that the benefits from community employment participation were 90% greater than the net cost of the programme. In 2008, over 44% of community employment workers progressed into employment or further education and more than 30,618 training awards were made to community employment workers, including Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC and Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, awards. The total estimated individual benefits from qualification awards in that year was €12,580,300. There are 184,800 long-term unemployed people and any reduction of funding for community employment negatively impacts on the abilities of schemes to provide training and educational opportunities for unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups. Community employment is the backbone of the community sector, providing nearly one third of the total employment. Child care projects, youth projects, disability projects, elder care, arts, sport and cultural schemes, to list but a few, are dependent on community employment workers. The 1995 Fitzpatrick Associates cost-benefit analysis found that local development benefits accounted for 64% of the overall
value of community employment. In community child care, for example, 1,288 of 8,200 child care workers in community-based child care facilities are community employment workers, and it is estimated that over 70% of those are lone parents. There are 2,200 community employment places ring-fenced for child care, 1,000 for drug rehabilitation and 2,800 for health and social care. Community employment has an intrinsic social value. The review of labour market programmes carried out by Forfás found that:Community Employment activity provides economic and social benefits to communities around the country in terms of providing services that would otherwise be lacking – especially those in disadvantaged areas. It provides support for several hundred community organisations, local councils, VEC's, Drug Task Forces, the HSE, Semi-State bodies and national charitable organisations.A 2011 paper by the Combat Poverty Agency, entitled Combating Social Disadvantage in Social Housing Estates, found that: "The Community Employment scheme is a core element of much of the area-based social provision now in place in Ireland and its contribution in that regard should be more clearly recognised and incorporated into the rationale for providing it and the bases on which it is evaluated." It is clear that community employment provides vital services in every sector of society, especially in areas of disadvantage, and the removal of these services through further cuts to community employment would have a devastating impact on communities. In December 2011, the Government announced a reduction in the community employment budget in the order of €36 million, in the form of a 66% reduction in the materials and training allocation. It also announced that the retention of secondary payments for those with a disability and for lone parents would cease for all new community employment entrants from February 2012. Following the announced cuts, community employment workers, supervisors and sponsor groups, supported by SIPTU, campaigned and lobbied Deputies and councillors throughout the country to have funding restored. A financial review of all community employment schemes was announced by the Minister, which took more than seven months to complete, during which time schemes faced uncertainty and financial difficulties and many community employment workers were unable to complete training modules. On completion of the review, the Department of Social Protection announced the reallocation of €9.5 million to community employment budgets for 2012 which, although broadly welcomed, is still in the order of a 30% to 40% cut. There is also huge variation in terms of grant allocations. Many schemes are still under extreme financial pressure and face uncertain futures. There has been no adjustment of the cuts to secondary benefits. The impact of this decision is twofold. First, for lone parents and people with disabilities, community employment is no longer a financially viable path to employment and training, which has limited their options for re-entry into the workforce and training. Second, many community employment projects, especially in child care and drug rehabilitation, are dependent on community employment workers who were in receipt of an additional social welfare payment. We now have a situation where many community employment projects are unable to recruit suitable workers, placing their future viability in doubt. Community child care projects, for example, will have to reduce capacity or even close if a solution cannot be found. SIPTU activists have been campaigning tirelessly all year against cuts to community employment and to protect schemes and community services. This has been done through visiting Deputies, proposing parliamentary questions, lobbying councillors, organising community employment open days and promoting community employment through local media. We call on the Government to ensure community employment workers have access to high quality, accredited training, that placements are for three years to facilitate training and valuable work experience, that lone parents and people with disabilities are facilitated financially to cover their additional expenses in accessing community employment, and that vital community services are protected. We call for meaningful negotiations between the Department of Social Protection, SIPTU, as the workers' representative body, and relevant stakeholders on the future shape of community employment schemes and to agree reforms with workers, supervisors and sponsors. In that context, the Department's recent announcement that an employment schemes advisory committee would be established to advise the Minister on the implementation of the upcoming labour market review is welcome. There is not a town in Ireland that does not benefit from community employment. Not only does it provide local services, it also gives people an opportunity to work, achieve a qualification and give something back to their community. In areas of disadvantage in particular, community employment can be a second chance for people. We must ensure community employment continues to provide this worthwhile service. I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time and am happy to answer any questions they may have.

They highlighted some of the changes that are coming but some of the questions and issues raised by Mr. O'Connor were not fully addressed.  Can Mr. O'Connor tell me the cost of a FETAC level 5 child care course and how long such a course takes to complete?  Can it be done within a year or does it require more time than that?  The information I have is that it is not always possible to complete a FETAC level 5 child care course in a single year or even to progress beyond that.  The use of community employment schemes as a vehicle through which people attained child care qualifications and progressed to full-time employment is not an option any more because the private sector is now demanding level 6 qualifications and it is my understanding that it is not possible to complete levels 5 and 6 in a single year.  How have projects been affected by the changes relating to those on disability allowance and lone parents allowance?  I quoted figures earlier from CityWide which indicate that there has been an 84% drop in recruitment for community employment schemes.  Some of the schemes in my area are seriously stretched and are talking about reducing the services they can offer.  Some of the child care facilities are reducing the numbers they can cater for.  Is the drop in recruitment happening across the board?  The Kilbarrack coast community programme has been very successful in dealing with literacy issues, IT training support and so forth, but the cuts to the materials and training grant has badly affected it.A number of other schemes have had the same type of recognition from the State, through Aontas for example, but no longer have money available. There has been a promise from officials that the VEC will, at some stage, get its act together and begin to deliver literacy and IT support schemes. In the meantime, what is the effect on CE schemes? On page 4 of his presentation, Mr. O'Connor says the total estimated individual benefits from qualification awards, that is, the substantial FETAC awards that participants have got over the years, was worth €12.5 million in 2008. Where does that figure comes from? Does it refer to the benefit to society as a whole? If people's ability to progress through CE, come out with an award and get into work is restricted, what would be the effect of that on the figure of €12.5 million?

Mr. O'Connor said in presentation that the Government had announced reductions to the CE budget of the order of €36 million, and of 66% in the materials and training allocation.  How did he come up with the figure of €36 million?  In the presentation by Department officials they mentioned the financial review which says €20.5 million was provided for training and materials this year compared with €29.4 million in 2011.  The issue of double payment was raised.  The feedback I get as a public representative is that most people felt the double payment was not sustainable or justifiable.  Some CE participants had larger incomes than public service employees or even their CE scheme supervisors.  The payment was unsustainable, from a budgetary point of view, and was a disincentive to people seeking work, in the public sector, for example, where they would earn much less.  This would arise for people whose families were of a certain size and had large social welfare payments.

I hope they will continue the campaign.  It is invaluable for public representatives.  Has SIPTU done any assessment on the quality of the education and training elements of CE?  I would have been sceptical about them.  How was the quantity and quality of the education and training elements measured?  Does Mr. O'Connor have a view on the prospect of the VEC as a likely contender for doing more of the education and training?  Would he welcome that, or does he have a view on it?  It is something I would certainly welcome.

Public representatives are kept aware of this issue every day of the week.  I missed the presentation by the officials of the Department.  They may have addressed the issue I raise.  Last year, there was uproar when the cuts were announced.  It was feared that community employment schemes would close.  How many, if any, schemes closed when the cutbacks were made?  Have participants encountered difficulty in progressing their training following the cutbacks?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	64	Yes.  Level 6 has been introduced recently to qualify as a practitioner.  It could not be done in two or three years.  It takes between a year and a half and two years to do level 5.  It will probably take another year to do level 6.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	65	The next question related to how projects are affected by cuts to disability and lone parent's payments.  There is a practical issue in areas such as drug rehabilitation and child care, where we are seeing an impact.  A high proportion of CE child care workers are lone parents and have been in receipt of those additional payments.  We are now finding that child care facilities cannot find staff to meet their ratio requirements and this is putting pressure on their existing resources.  Many of them are contemplating reducing the number of children they take on.  This reduces their income stream and leads to a vicious cycle.  Practical issues arise as a result.  In drug rehabilitation projects, where 1,000 places are ring-fenced, there appears to be a huge reluctance among people who need to avail of these services to give up their disability payment and go onto a CE scheme.  People seem to be fearful that they may not resume their disability payment when they come off the CE scheme.  They have medical needs and need their disability payment.  The demand for drug rehabilitation services has not declined but schemes are finding it difficult to persuade people to join, because of the financial implications.  I will ask Mr. Seamus Briscoe to say a few words about how the cuts to training and materials grants have affected CE schemes since last year's budget.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	66	The cuts had a disastrous effect on training in the first seven or eight months until the reintroduction of a training budget, of sorts, amounting to approximately €250 per participant.  We were devoid of training, meaningful or otherwise, unless it could be sourced free of charge by the scheme, the supervisor or the sponsors, from the VEC or elsewhere.  Schemes have been very successful in sourcing literacy and further education programmes through the VEC or through the agencies that provide them.  We were successful in getting people to junior certificate and even leaving certificate standard.  It is often left to a supervisor to deduce that a person has a literacy difficulty or is dyslexic and to progress that person to the next level of education.  We have had success stories in that regard.The figure of €250 is 50% of what we were previously allowed. The question about childminding is not pertinent to my area of expertise, which is the sporting and social area. We begin the first rung of the ladder when the supervisor assesses the one-to-one relationships with the participants. Even after they leave the schemes, we do our best to progress the participants, and they frequently go on to achieve qualifications, to degree level in some cases. We begin them on the first rung of the ladder with regard to the required FETAC qualifications and modules. The resulting end product is qualification up to degree level in some cases. I have been fortunate to experience this on my own scheme. I hope this answers the committee's questions about the training process.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	67	I will ask Mr. David Connolly to speak about the meaningful engagement process.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	68	As Senator Moloney said, the cut applied in last year's budget was a shock to the whole system.  We know from our meeting with the Minister that it was foisted on that Department in an attempt to deal with something of the scale of 60%.  We need to acknowledge that the officials were the ones who had to deal with much of that stress.  As Mr. Briscoe said, people at local level felt under threat because the future of their jobs schemes was up in the air.  It is important to acknowledge that the officials were in a difficult position where they had to deal with everything while at the same time trying to engage with people.  I think they found that the engagement through the unions in particular helped them to work through the process.  We are not pretending it is anywhere near the end of the process but that was an important point.  Mr. Darragh O'Connor referred to the community employment campaign run by SIPTU.  Many of the activists are in the Gallery to hear the evidence to this committee.  It was important that we engaged with the Government backbenchers and the Opposition parties.  Much of the change happened because of that internal pressure on the Minister from the parties.  We learned that there are many Deputies who are very connected into the work of community employment and the wider community sector and the benefits and argument for it.  We have a very informed electorate.  However, our concern now is that we have been warned by the Taoiseach and the Minister responsible that this budget will be the worst ever in their term of office.  I do not know why they keep telling us it will be the worst ever.  This creates a serious threat to the future of community employment.  We ask the committee to be aware of this issue because there is a danger that the Minister rather than the Department could decide that we should start with last year's allocation and then have the argument.  It is vital the committee ensures the Minister allocates the funding necessary for this programme into next year so that another crisis is avoided. I refer to the important work by the Department officials and their presentation today.  Despite all the stress and turmoil, we now have evidence in financial terms to show what it costs to run community employment.  We have recommendations that value the service side as well as the activation side.  Coming to the end of this year and into next year, we have much more concrete evidence of the costs and the fact that the scheme is run very efficiently and has been developed over many years.  Mr. Oliver Egan said there are cuts of €3.5 million to be found.  It is good if they know that but it should be retained in the programme because, in fact, their own report shows there is a greater demand for training.  It is welcome that the officials who produced this report acknowledge the importance of training in the current environment.  I have two further points to make.  The Minister assured us we would be involved actively with her and the officials, and this has happened.  However, we will now be facing a potentially ominous report on the activation process, in other words, labour market activation.  There seems to be a mindset and an obsession - some of it driven by the ESRI and the Forfás report and this seems to be contaminating the troika representatives - that the only reason for community employment and other schemes is to do with activation into the labour market.  We know in this country that there is not an active labour market in this current environment.  The representatives have said new approaches need to be developed, and social economy is one such approach.  I remind the committee that when Deputy Ruairí Quinn was the Minister responsible for enterprise back in the 1990s, the size of community employment schemes was doubled because the infrastructure was capable of doing so.  We are not arguing it is all the one thing.  It is good to hear the Department officials saying the Tús programme should be aligned, as should the RSS, but in doing so the differences in wage scales and conditions need to be addressed without undermining or diluting the effectiveness of community employment.  The other schemes should be brought up to the same level.  With reference to the double payment, there is no question that the decision to remove the payments from lone parents and those with disabilities had a major impact on people who have been recognised as among those most likely to be living in poverty.  Recent research work in UCD has shown that in the general population there is a 16% risk of poverty but it is 35% among lone parents.  The argument that they are getting an income over and above what others who are on the scheme receive misses the fundamental point.  It was not just an income, rather it was to address the circumstances of those who are lone parents or those with disabilities because their circumstances are different from the rest of the population.  It was designed to act as an incentive to ensure this participation would be of benefit to them and their children.  The case being made is reflected in the Department's report.  It states there should be tailor-made approaches to those circumstances.  For example, we support the drugs projects and child care projects.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  We argue it is vital a means is found to re-involve lone parents or those with a disability.  The VEC programmes were very effective in the earlier days of the community employment scheme.  They are a vital element in providing quality training and also because they are in receipt of much of the funding that was taken away from the Department of Social Protection and was taken over by the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a strong argument for a more active involvement by the VECs.  However, in doing so, they need to talk to the local sponsors, the workers and the trade unions about their requirements in order that it is not another one-size-fits-all approach that suits the VECs.  Those are the issues I want to deal with.

I looked at a lone parent with a particular number of children and I compared the income to be received from a social employment scheme with what a student nurse receives.  The student nurse was coming out a lot worse.  The student nurse would be better off financially in the end because he or she would have a career progression over the years, earn a reasonable salary and have a permanent and pensionable job.  I still believe there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  If double payments were not restored, what would Mr. O'Connor suggest as a support for a lone parent?  What should the Department do, in his view, to support lone parents and people with disabilities?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	75	The Chairman has summed it up correctly.  However, she is leaving out some of the aspects we would encounter as to what lone parents have to deal with.  They may wish to re-enter a system that will re-introduce them to training or to the work ethic.Their income is not sufficient. They may have child care costs and be obliged to make mortgage repayments and they just cannot do both. They cannot sustain their position in this regard no more than they can actually sustain themselves. The Deputy's summation is probably correct. I am merely providing details on the type of practical cases we encounter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	76	If I was a lone parent taking up a place on a CE scheme at present, I would be receiving €237.80.  This would be if I had one child.  If there were child care costs involved, I would not be able to afford to take up the place on the scheme.  If we are to be able to facilitate lone parents and people with disabilities to access CE, which is the main avenue for them to partake of work or training opportunities, consideration must be given to child care provision.  I am reluctant to put an exact figure on it but some kind of additional payment would need to be made.  This would be in recognition of the fact that people are obliged to meet certain costs, such as those relating to buying lunch, paying transport costs, etc.  We would love the payment to be restored.  In the absence of this, however, there is room for manoeuvre in the context of making CE a viable option.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	77	If I could take up that point, aside from the money issue, we are concerned here with the fundamental role of community employment.  Last April, just over 20% of the participants on community employment schemes were lone parents.  This represents a significant drop on the previous position.  Some 16% of the participants were those with disabilities.  As Mr. Darragh O'Connor stated, we want to ensure we do not end up losing the entire concept behind community employment, namely, the benefits it has for the services sector, the individuals who partake of the scheme and the labour market, as a result of pressure arising from the scale of the unemployment problem.  Community employment is targeted at those in particular circumstances such as the long-term unemployed, lone parents and those with disabilities.  There is a belief that after being unemployed for six months, people need to be doing something and this gives rise to the pressure to which I refer.  As Deputy Connaughton said, we need to ensure community employment will be viewed not merely as the quickest way to get large numbers of people back into the labour market.  I hope the thrust of the Department's presentation will be reflected in the wide range of labour market activation programmes which exist.  I hope the baby will not be thrown out with the bathwater and that it will not be a case of deciding that it is all just about how large numbers of people can be placed on community employment schemes.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, rehabilitation is no longer working in the cases of many lone parents who are drug addicts.  There has been an 84% drop in this regard, which is an extremely serious development.  Ring-fencing 1,000 places for those who are addicted to drugs was a vital element in the context of rehabilitation and really had nothing to do with CE.  We do not want to lose these.  There must be an incentive in the context of facilitating certain people with regard to CE rather than obliging them to just fit in with everyone else.  That is the argument in respect of lone parents and those with disabilities.

It was stated earlier that it is not possible for people to pursue a FETAC level 5 course.  What is the position with other schemes?  The scheme with which I am familiar is that which relates to child care.  The campaign raised a range of other issues during the past year and I presume that SIPTU is still engaging with the Department in respect of pay and conditions, collective bargaining for supervisors and other vital issues.  The issues to which I refer have been forgotten to some extent as a result of the crisis in dealing with the day-to-day operation of CE schemes and ensuring participants can avail of some type of training.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	79	In respect of the extensions, there are different interpretations.  Ms Doreen O'Connor will testify to the fact that in the context of child care there is a need for a period beyond the initial year.  Possibly, it could be extended to three years.  This is a matter in respect of which a supervisor and a higher executive officer would consult and make a decision.  Extensions vary and would be determined by the level of progression in the context of seeking a qualification or training or seeking a qualification and training.  In respect of the Deputy's other queries and questions, we have been involved in discussions and negotiations for the past year.  Some of the matters in that regard, in the context of community terms, social terms or whatever, are not relevant to this meeting.  Issues have arisen for some supervisors and these are ongoing.  We hope that at some stage we will reach a compromise as a result of our negotiations.  What has happened during the past year has been very frustrating.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	80	This is the crux of the matter.  Studies show that in respect of CE, one gets the biggest bang for one's buck in areas such as child care and elder care where high skills specific training is provided.  If we are going to take this on in a serious way, then people need to be trained up to FETAC level 5 or level 6 or whatever is the industry standard.  In addition, people must be given the time to pursue and complete the relevant courses.  What is required, therefore, is access to quality training.  Such training is provided by VECs or other providers.  In such circumstances, three years is a realistic goal because not only will people have an opportunity to complete their training, but also the organisation involved will also get something out of it.  A three year period would ensure there would not be a constant churn of people through those organisations.  In other words, individuals would not leave immediately upon obtaining a qualification.  There is a need to bring some kind of stability into the workforce which relates to community organisations.  These are the key points we are trying to get across in the context of the training aspect.

Mr. Darragh O'Connor referred to a constant churn of people through organisations.  In that context, there is no benefit to participants because they are halfway through courses when they are obliged to leave.  Equally, there is no benefit to the scheme because it must begin again with someone new.  This all takes a great deal of time.  Three years is a very abnormal period nowadays and it would only be one year in the majority of cases.  With the exception of the training and materials grant, this is nearly the equivalent of the position with regard to Tús courses.  I do not know whether our guests are familiar with the suggestion to the effect that, with the exception of an element of training which might be provided by VECs in future, there is a move towards equating CE with Tús.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Minimising Unemployment: Discussion with Department of Social Protection	83	There has been an increasing amount of discussion to the effect CE courses are going to move toward the one year model.  This misses the point which various members of the committee have highlighted, namely, the benefit of CE to individuals and local communities.  I do not know how we are going to sustain quality community services if everyone is on one year contracts.  There are underlying issues for those who are long-term unemployed which can take six to 12 months to address before those individuals can take up vocational training.  Community employment plays a key role in local communities and it really is the backbone of the community and voluntary sector.  Without it and the quality training and longer-term placements it offers, there will be a detrimental impact not just on the people involved but also on the schemes and various organisations involved: Enable Ireland, Age Action Ireland, meals on wheels, the Alzheimer's Association, etc.  Unless we are able to protect the social aspect of community employment, we will be much worse off.  A short-term saving will possibly be made but, as a result of the choices we make in the next six to 12 months, there will be a cost to be met in 20 years' time when the services begin to crumble around us.  I thank the Chairman and members for their time.

It has been very valuable to hear both sides, from the Department and the witnesses.  This is an issue of great interest to Deputies and Senators because we can see the value of community employment schemes in our constituencies.  They have become professional over the years, and now have a formal training and education structure whereby people reach various levels.  We will keep on top of this issue because like the witnesses and the Department we were also taken by surprise last year.  We have learned much from this.  We will send the presentations made today and a transcript of the meeting to the Minister for Social Protection and we will ask her to comment.  She will come before the committee at a future date and we will raise the issue with her then and do our best to ensure the sector is protected.
