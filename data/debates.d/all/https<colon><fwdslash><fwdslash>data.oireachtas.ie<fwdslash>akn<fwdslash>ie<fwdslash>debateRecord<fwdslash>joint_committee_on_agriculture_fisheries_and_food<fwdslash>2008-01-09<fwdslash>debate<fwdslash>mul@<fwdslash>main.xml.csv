#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Apologies have been received from Deputies Christy O'Sullivan, Eamon Scanlon and Martin Ferris.  Apologies have also been received from Senator Callanan, who is not a member of this committee but raised the particular issue we will discuss later.  We thought it fitting to invite him to the meeting but, unfortunately, he is ill and cannot attend.  I propose that we go into private session to discuss some housekeeping matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
The joint committee went into private session at 12.05 p.m. and resumed in public session at 12.30 p.m.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	On behalf of the joint committee I welcome Mr. Dermot Sheridan, Mr. Gordon Rennick and Ms Anne-Marie Dillon from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  They are here to brief us on the proposed EU directive on pesticides.  I thank the delegation for attending.I draw attention to the fact that while members of the committee have absolute privilege this privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  Members are also reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Sheridan to make his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I am a senior inspector with the pesticide control service of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  My service is responsible for the formulation and implementation of the regulatory framework for the marketing and use of plant protection products.Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerns the placing of plant protection products on the market and was transposed into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument, namely, No. 83 of 2003.  There was an earlier statutory instrument but this consolidated all of the measures in place.  It established a regulatory framework within which my Department operates in relation to plant protection products.I am joined by Mr. Kevin Cassidy, Mr. Gordon Rennick and Ms Anne-Marie Dillon.  Mr. Rennick and Ms Dillon are agricultural inspectors in the regulatory and enforcement unit of the pesticide control service.  They have both been directly involved in the ongoing negotiations on the various pesticide proposals.  Mr. Cassidy is the principal officer in the plant production and safety division of the Department which provides administrative support for us and is here in that capacity.I understand this is the second time this issue has been raised at the committee.  Last year a colleague attended and while other issues were raised, some of the issues discussed related to the regulation of plant protection products.  It might be useful to put the documents I have detailed in context.  I will start with some general information on plant protection products.  Plant protection products containing pesticide active substances can be chemical or biological in nature.  They are normally used to prevent damage caused by harmful organisms such as weeds for which herbicides are used, insects for which insecticides are used, plant pathogens for which fungicides are used, and snails for which molluscicides are used, as well as other such pests.Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market introduced a two stage process for the regulation of plant protection products.  Reflecting the principle of subsidiarity, pesticide substances are approved centrally by the European Commission, in consultation with member states and the European Food Safety Authority.  Products containing these substances are authorised for use by member states through the application of uniform principles for evaluation and decision making.The regime in place establishes a high level of protection for man, animals and the environment and also serves to facilitate free trade.  The programme to review all existing active substances to ensure the same standards are applied to existing and new active substances is at an advanced stage.  Approximately 60% of the programme is complete.  However, due to the lack of suitable guidance and procedures, the review programme which was due to be completed by 2003 has been considerably delayed and the European Parliament has imposed a new deadline of December this year.In adopting the sixth environmental action plan in 2002 the European Parliament and the Council agreed an approach involving implementation and revision of the relevant legal framework for pesticides through the development of a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides.  This recognised that the existing legislative framework mainly concentrated on the start and end-of-life phases of pesticides, that is, the authorisation of plant protection products for placing on the market and the control of their residues in food and feedstuffs.The thematic strategy is designed to revise and enhance the existing legislative framework and, in particular, to target the use phase of plant protection products.  Implementation of the strategy has resulted in the European Commission submitting proposals for a directive establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides; a regulation of the European Council and the Parliament concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market; and a regulation of the European Council and the Parliament concerning statistics for plant protection products.Today I want to update the committee on the progress made on the thematic strategy and answer any questions members may have.  I understand the forthcoming EU directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which includes plant protection products, is the main subject under discussion.  The objectives of the draft directive, as set out by the Commission, are as follows: to encourage rational and responsible use of pesticides and appropriate crop and soil management practices; to improve the behaviour of pesticide users and professional users, in particular, by ensuring better training and education; and to improve the quality of pesticide application equipment in order to optimise the effectiveness of treatment, while minimising adverse impacts on human health and the environment.The main provision of the directive is the establishment of a national action plan to set objectives to reduce risks.  An obligatory system of training and certification will be established for professional users of pesticides, as well as a system of inspection of application equipment.  There will be a prohibition on aerial spraying, with possible derogations.  The proposal will also include specific measures to protect the aquatic environment, designate areas of greatly reduced or zero pesticide use, address the handling and storing of pesticides, promote integrated pest management and establish harmonised risk indicators for pesticides.Adoption and implementation of the proposal will lead to a wide range of additional controls to further enhance the protection afforded to those distributing, handling and using plant protection products.  It will also lead to a requirement to prepare national action plans to reduce the risks associated with the use of plant protection products, including a systematic and co-ordinated programme to further reduce the degree of risk arising for the environment.  It will further introduce a requirement for the deployment of additional resources by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and its associated agencies to give effect to the range of additional measures to be introduced.The proposed directive is progressive and ambitious.  Its adoption will further enhance the high level of protection afforded to humans, animals and the environment already achieved through the current regulatory system for pesticides.  To this end, Ireland welcomes the proposal.  It will serve to limit the use of plant protection products to situations where they are essential and extend the range of controls that govern the use of pesticides.  During negotiations, we have attempted to ensure any additional controls proposed can be justified and would make a real contribution to the sustainability of environmentally sensitive agricultural production in Ireland.The European Parliament's Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety commenced their examination of the proposal in early 2007 and adopted a report in a plenary session of the Parliament on 23 October.  The agriculture Ministers gave their political agreement at Council between 17 and 19 December.  The text of this agreement will be finalised in the official languages of the European Union with a view to its formal adoption by Council and will then be forwarded to the European Parliament.  Discussions with a view to finalising an agreed text will then take place between the Parliament and the Council and will involve the Presidency and the Commission.I am unsure whether the Chairman wants me to deal with legislation other than that dealing with sustainable use at this point.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	While Mr. Sheridan is here, he might as well address the additional areas.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I referred in my presentation to other items of legislation.  First, there is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market — members have the number of the relevant document.  On adoption, this regulation will replace Directive 91/414/EEC and will also repeal Council Directive 79/117/EEC which prohibits the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances.  It was developed following extensive consultation and is designed to update the existing regulatory framework for plant protection products.Key features of the proposal, stressed by the Commission in presenting its proposal to the 2,750th meeting of the Council of the European Union in September 2006, are as follows: it provides for the continued maintenance of a high level of protection for human health and the environment; it reflects the Lisbon strategy — the proposed procedures provide more certainty and enhance competitiveness; it provides for better regulation through simplification; and it is linked to the Commission communication on the thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the Commission proposal for a directive establishing the framework I mentioned earlier.The Commission highlighted the following particular elements of its proposal: its consistency with other measures concerning the regulation of chemicals; the introduction of comparative assessment and the substitution principle; a simplification of the rules on data protection; and the strengthening of control measures.  During the initial discussions, which commenced in September 2006, Ireland welcomed the proposal as being progressive, balanced and well constructed.  Ireland also welcomed the intention to continue ensuring a high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment.Issues of concern being pursued during the detailed examination of the proposal include the following: the need for the reintroduction of arrangements for authorisation of plant protection products containing new active substances for provisional periods to ensure that farmers and growers have early access to improved means to protect crops and to prevent a reduction in the competitiveness of Irish and European agriculture; the need to continue with the scientific, risk-based approach for authorisation of plant protection products; the need to change the rules on the protection afforded to proprietary data and to extend the procedures to deal with intercompany disputes to avoid restricting the availability of required technology to Irish and European agriculture and to ensure that plant protection products are available to Irish farmers and growers at competitive prices; the need to elaborate rules on parallel imports; the need to insert explicit procedural rules to facilitate efficiency and predictability in the elaboration of conclusions prepared by the European Food Safety Authority on active substances and to ensure the continued competitiveness of Irish and European agriculture; and the need to adjust the procedures proposed for mutual recognition of authorisations by other member states to ensure that products authorised for use in Ireland are appropriate for local conditions and to prevent progress achieved in recent years in minimising the risks associated with the use of pesticides being reversed.The European Parliament concluded its First Reading on 23 October 2007 and has proposed a large number of amendments.  Council will continue to work towards a common position on the text during 2008 with a view to reaching political agreement.  It is not possible, at this stage, to predict when the agreement will be reached, except to say that the current Slovenian Presidency has given the issue high priority in its plan for Council meetings.I now wish to brief the committee on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning statistics on plant protection products.  In the overall context of the sixth environmental action plan, this regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products is considered a fundamental part of the thematic strategy proposed by the Commission.  It encompasses different kinds of measures concerning practical aspects of pesticide use and more systematic collection of data on pesticides.The proposal creates a legal framework and lays down harmonised rules for collection and dissemination of data concerning the placing on the market and use of plant protection products.  The main objective of the regulation is to ensure comparable data are collected in all member states, making it possible to calculate harmonised risk indicators and measure the progress made towards more sustainable use of plant protection products throughout the community.This proposal has been progressed mainly through the written procedure.  Progress towards adoption has been slow, with both Council and Parliament preferring to await final agreement on the other two pieces of legislation detailed above before finalising discussions.My colleagues and I will endeavour to assist the committee by responding to any questions.  If we do not have the answers directly to hand we would be happy to communicate the information to the committee subsequently.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I thank Mr. Sheridan for his presentation.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank Mr. Sheridan and his colleagues for appearing before the committee and providing a submission.  The proposal in question has sent a shudder down the spine of people involved in commercial agriculture, as they are concerned this may be another measure that will undermine livelihoods.  Is there evidence to suggest the use of pesticides in the context of Irish agriculture is unsustainable?  Is there evidence that unsustainable use across the European Union is damaging to humans and the environment?  What is the raison d’être for this proposal?I would like to believe, along with most people, that there is no such evidence.  In consultations with farming organisations, the valid point has been made that an excessive use of pesticides is a cost to farmers, and they only use pesticides to protect crops.  An excessive use would very often be damaging both to the crop and to the farmers in a commercial sense.  What is the source of the evidence suggesting an unsustainable use of pesticides?The presentation was quite comprehensive but I will consider some of the issues raised.  The establishment of national action plans and inspections of application equipment brings to mind the idea of agricultural inspectors going out to tillage farmers' yards and inspecting the nozzles on sprayers, perhaps finding a defect.  A person experiencing conditions conducive to potato blight could have machinery impounded, leading to crop loss.  Is this a legitimate concern?What is envisaged by an obligatory system of training and certification for professional users of pesticides and who defines what a professional user of pesticides is?  Will we create a niche market for people who can claim to be the only trained professional user of pesticides in a particular county, such as Kilkenny, so that people will have to use that service rather than spraying their own crops?  Such service providers may not be able to spray a crop for a week despite blight conditions being evident on a particular day.  People would be concerned about such a scenario.If there is no evidence to suggest agricultural practices or those evident in other sectors — such as on golf courses — are unsustainable with regard to pesticide use, why are we considering the proposal?  The primary concern is that this may affect people's livelihoods.  I would like to be reassured by the officials that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will ensure this regulation does not adversely impact on agriculture.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12817	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I, too, welcome this comprehensive presentation, from which many questions arise.In terms of the draft directive's objectives, will specific pesticides in common use be banned?  If one of the objectives set out by the European Commission is to improve the behaviour of pesticide users by ensuring better training and education, will every pesticide user in the land, regardless of profession, require certification?  Is this matter to be returned for a Second Reading at the Council of Ministers?  Are there stumbling blocks between the European Parliament's reading of the directive, the Second Reading by the Council of Ministers and where the issue stands?  The officials' assessment states the text of the agreement will be finalised in the official languages of the European Union with a view to its formal adoption by the Council.  Is this a fait accompli or must negotiations be undertaken before the Second Reading by the Council and the directive is placed before the European Parliament again?This issue arose from the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community 2002 — 2012 and was, therefore, a matter that could have been foreseen.  Those involved in the food industry and agri-business may fear that the directive will be so prescriptive regarding practices that they will experience unnecessary costs.  We all recognise that the use of pesticides must be regulated but my questions remain.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Speaking as a farmer, I am worried about the controls being imposed, although, as has been said, we all recognise that the control of pesticides is necessary, as they must not be used freely.  I am worried about the cost to farmers that might be involved in the imposition of these regulations.  Most farmers, some 50% to 60% of them, spray their own crops, be they potatoes, corn or other produce.  They have their own systems for spraying.  I wonder if these EU regulations will ban some of the pesticides traditionally used during the years and dictate those that can be used.  While I am worried about the costs that may face farmers as a result of these regulations, we welcome controls on the use of pesticides, as they are necessary.This may not be the appropriate place to mention this but ragweed, or yellow weed as it is also known, has become prevalent again in Ireland.  At one time it was under control.  The worst offender is local government, as the weed can now be seen along ditches and beside main roads.  I would like a comment on this issue, as the professionals from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are before us.  We should introduce legislation to ensure county councils take responsibility for cutting this unsightly weed.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I join my fellow committee members in welcoming Mr. Sheridan and his colleagues who gave a good account of the proposed EU directives.Will existing outlets for the sale of pesticides, co-operatives and so on, remain the primary distributors or will a more professional aspect be introduced?  Will sales stay with the co-ops and such organisations?Mr. Sheridan stated that one of the objectives of the draft directive was "to improve the behaviour of pesticide users and professional users in particular by ensuring better training and education".  Will there now be a difference between the professional and the farmer?  Will farmers still be allowed to do their own thing as they have been heretofore?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I welcome the presentation.  What evidence or information do we have about water pollution caused by agricultural pesticides in this country?  Is it a problem?  One hears much more often about pollution caused by slurry and so on.  Is there a specific problem with pesticide pollution?Mr. Sheridan referred to three pieces of draft legislation.  Could he give the committee some idea as to how they will be transposed into Irish law if and when they are passed?  Will it be via legislation or statutory instrument?  If it is legislation, how much discretion, if any, will there be in terms of adapting to local Irish circumstances or will it be the same legislative straitjacket for everyone, with no discretion?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I welcome the Department officials.  Controls such as those we are discussing today are desirable but, similar to most of the previous speakers, I am concerned about excessive regulation and the cost of implementation.  Most farmers and agricultural contractors, of whom I am one, are careful and prudent about the use of pesticides.  As mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Mansergh, I would like to know what is the evidence for damage caused by misuse of pesticides.  Will this directive result in a difference between farmers or small-time contractors and professionals?  What do the representatives mean by the term "professionals"?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I thank Mr. Sheridan and the Department officials for their presentation.  Mr. Sheridan mentioned that one of the issues of concern was the need for "early access to improved means to protect crops and to prevent a reduction in the competitiveness of Irish and European agriculture".  That is a broad statement.  Dissemination of information to pesticide users, whether farmers or professional users, is critical.  In the matter of access to crop protection, there is a problem with patent law.  If a new product becomes available and is generally accepted as being an improvement on the old one, it tends to be very expensive during the period of restriction on manufacture.  Are there proposals afoot to try to overcome this problem?It was mentioned that certain active ingredients are likely to be prohibited.  To which active ingredients does this apply?  In addition, I do not understand what was meant by "the need to elaborate rules on parallel imports".  Could Mr. Sheridan explain this, please?
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I welcome Mr. Sheridan and the comprehensive report which he placed before us.  Are we in danger of going overboard with regulations from the European Union?  Mr. Sheridan stated: "The regime in place establishes a high level of protection for man, animals and the environment and also serves to facilitate free trade."  If that is the case, why is it necessary to introduce a new set of regulations?  I am dubious about all these regulations that come from the EU.  It was also stated that: "due to the lack of suitable guidance and procedures, the review programme which was due to be completed by 2003 has been considerably delayed and the European Parliament has imposed a new deadline of December this year".  It has taken five years to draft the new regulations.  Will they impose an additional burden on the agriculture sector?The purpose of the meeting is to update the committee on progress made on the thematic strategy.  Why was it necessary to bring forward the strategy?  Is there a hidden agenda in its wake?  Will it impact on the production of potatoes and other vegetables?Some of the objectives of the draft directive have been unveiled.  One objective is to encourage the rational and responsible use of pesticides, as well as appropriate crop and soil management practices.  Every young farmer who has gone through agricultural college is well versed in the rational and responsible use of pesticides.  Another objective is to improve the behaviour of pesticide users, in particular, professional users, by ensuring better training and education.  What is meant by "professional users"?  Must young farmers attend night classes to be versed in the use of the modern techniques being introduced?Another objective is to improve the quality of pesticide application equipment.  My colleague, Deputy Creed, asked whether inspectors would carry out inspections of such equipment.  Will they look into every nozzle of a machine to ensure the correct pesticide is being used?  The inspection of pesticide application equipment might involve another hidden agenda.  There will be so many spot inspections that the future does not look good for a young farmer starting out.Mr. Sheridan stated that during the negotiations he attempted to ensure any additional controls proposed could be justified and would make a real contribution to the sustainability of environmentally sensitive agricultural production in Ireland.  We are in agreement, but was there a lack of control in the use of pesticides in the past decade?  I do not believe there was.  It has been stated plant protection products are available to farmers at competitive prices.  That is a step in the right direction, which I welcome.Are we going overboard in terms of regulations?  Weeds are growing in dykes and ditches along every road in Ireland and, under EU directives, cannot be cut until August or September on account of birds nesting and so on.  In the name of heavens, who is codding whom?  County councils throughout the country are responsible for spreading the seeds of the weeds that grow on the sides of the road.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Deputy, we will stay away from that issue.

#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	17	We are going a little overboard with regulations.  However, perhaps Mr. Sheridan will answer my questions.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	18	That was nearly as long as the report.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I will be brief.  Deputy Sheehan has covered acres of ground and applied a little pesticide as he was travelling.  Deputy Creed summed up the pertinent point of this debate and where our concerns originate.  Given the cost of pesticides and sprays and the fact that there have been economic difficulties for tillage farmers over the last five or six years, all tillage farmers have been exceptionally careful and prudent in the application of sprays.  An argument could be made that at times there was a lack, rather than a surplus use, of certain pesticides which caused economic difficulties.  The point is that farmers are not going to spend their money on expensive sprays and pesticides if they are not required.The document refers to certification and training for professional users of pesticides.  A farmer who uses pesticides is a professional user, not an amateur.  Is this a certification and training system for all farmers who will use pesticides?  Will there be some form of training course?  This matter should not become too complicated or bureaucratic.  Will Mr. Sheridan outline what is intended in that regard?
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Mr. Sheridan is welcome to reply.  If his colleagues wish to intervene, they can do so.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I am not sure what approach the Chairman would prefer but I will try to give holistic replies, for example, with regard to the definition of a professional user.  The definition of a professional user includes farmers.  A professional user means any person who uses pesticides in the course of his or her professional activities, including operators, technicians, employers and self-employed people, both in farming and in other sectors.  That is the definition in the directive on sustainable use.  It means farmers must show a level of competence in the use of pesticides.Before discussing what exactly that will be, I should mention that there is a directive on sustainable use and there are also regulations.  This might deal with the query raised by Deputy Mansergh.  Directives are less binding in their entirety on member states.  It is up to the member states to introduce them and in Ireland that is done through statutory instruments.  The directive on sustainable use, if and when it is finally agreed, will be introduced by way of a statutory instrument.  With a European Union regulation, on the other hand, there is no room for manoeuvre.  It is binding in its entirety and does not have to be transposed into national law.  The only items that might have to be transposed into national law are implementing instruments.  These deal with, for example, questions such as the level of certification, testing and so forth.  The directive sets out fairly clearly how frequently such testing should be undertaken in terms of application equipment.  We certainly do not envisage that inspectors will be landing in a farmer's yard when he is just about to spray his potatoes.  That is not envisaged.  I would envisage something more akin to the NCT where one shows that one's application equipment meets a certain standard and one would need to have it tested at a frequency which has not yet been decided.  There is still debate as to whether it should be tested every two years or every five years.  As members of the committee familiar with agricultural equipment will be aware, testing every five years leaves much room for disimprovement in the equipment.  That would clarify some of the queries.On the question of whether the use of pesticides is unsustainable at present, the clue is in where the entire strategy came from in the first place, namely, an environmental action programme.  Within Europe, the environmental directorate is responsible for the regulation of chemicals, and pesticides in particular, and it has a particular interest in pesticides.  There is a great deal of information about pesticides, much more than there is about many of the industrial chemicals.  As pesticides are used in the environment generally, for example, any farmer can spray them, as distinct from chemicals which may be used in the household and could have a far more direct effect on human health, there is this idea that pesticides are out there and, potentially, can pollute the soil, air and water.  As the committee will be aware, the water industry is extremely active in Europe with the Water Framework Directive and such like.A direct answer to the question of whether the current use is unsustainable is "No".  Current use is sustainable.  One must bear in mind that this is a European provision.  We can look at ourselves and state that we are role models.  While I am not so sure that we are, nonetheless the provision is intended to create regulation for the whole of Europe.I do not foresee that the directive will have a serious impact on Ireland due to the fact that the directive can be transposed to take into account local conditions and that is the important point about it.  It allows that amount of flexibility.  The text allows certain derogations, such as where it refers to "prohibition of aerial spraying".  In Ireland, aerial spraying is not a major issue and it could be ten or 15 years since there was a request for aerial spraying.  If weather conditions demand it, at least the directive provides that aerial spraying would be possible in the future.  From that point of view, the directive has sufficient flexibility for us to have a degree of comfort.Training is also an aspect that already exists in a number of member states.  There is a feeling within Europe that it is difficult to argue for a lowering of standards in some countries.  It is not acceptable, in the countries where they do have training, for a new regulation being introduced to state that there is no need for training.  It is difficult for anybody to defend such a view.  Therefore, whenever there is a harmonisation of rules, they always harmonise to the higher level.  That is the reality within Europe.  It happens in respect of all areas and not just that relating to pesticides.On the issue of training, members should recall the original tenet of the strategy, namely, risk reduction.  It is extremely important to remember that we are trying to reduce the risk that arises from the use of pesticides.  We are not trying to ban pesticides, we are merely seeking to ensure that if they are used, they will be used correctly, safely and with a minimum of harmful effects.  Our aim is to reduce risk.For the information of members, and in the context of the second item of legislation relating to the placing of products on the market, there is a proposal that, in the context of decisions being made, hazard-based cut-off criteria be introduced.  At present, if a substance is found to be highly toxic, it is stipulated that it should not be included in any pesticide.  If a risk-based approach were applied, it would be stated that the substance may be used provided it is used in such a way that there is no risk to the user, the consumer or the environment.  There is a fundamental difference between these two approaches.  This is one of the areas in respect of which we will face something of a fight during the next 12 months.We do not foresee implementation of the proposed directive giving rise to unnecessary or major costs.  However, I am not sure how it will be done.  We must await the final text.  As Deputy Sherlock stated, the directive is only being given its Second Reading and we will not know the position until the final text emerges.  The latter is a matter for negotiation between the Parliament and the Council, with the assistance of the Commission.  Members are probably aware that if the Commission is of the view that the way matters are proceeding in respect of the proposal are not acceptable, it can withdraw the proposal.  That possibility exists but I do not foresee it arising in this case.It is difficult to indicate when everything relating to the proposed directive will finally come into operation.  Reference was made to a national action plan, which must be developed three years after adoption.  The proposed directive will not be adopted this year because it should go forward as an entire package.  Final adoption could be as far away as 2014.  Nonetheless, we must continue to monitor progress.The timeframe for the training of users, etc., is two years after adoption.  Deputy Sheehan referred to agricultural colleges and, as part of their courses, students learn how to use pesticides.  The latter would be taken into account as part of the training.Members involved in farming will be aware of the use of preventive or prophylactic spraying regimes.  Under such regimes, farmers growing potatoes, for example, may decide to spray their crops every ten days in order to control blight.  Such spraying is carried out every ten days, almost regardless of the weather.  It will become more difficult for people to operate such regimes and they will be obliged to pursue a "wait and see" approach.  Integrated pest management involves waiting, monitoring the problem and then solving it rather than anticipating difficulties that might arise.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Absolutely.  Nonetheless, this is one of the areas in respect of which matters will be made somewhat more difficult.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We acknowledge that there are certain diseases in respect of which such an approach would not be suitable.  However, the directive will allow sufficient flexibility for member states.  For example, blight warnings from Met Éireann, decision support systems used by Teagasc and private consultants and a number of other areas in which advice could be given could apply prophylactically.  The fundamental change is that decision-making for prophylactic use would be taken from the farmer.  It is acknowledged that where certain plant diseases are concerned, once there is an infection, the battle is lost.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Of course but this year was particularly tough for potato blight, whereas two years ago there were considerably fewer applications.  It is a matter of hitting a reasonable compromise without compromising on the farmer's ability to make money.  That is something we recognise and are supportive of within the industry.  We acknowledge the potential difficulties.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	A question that came up more than once related to the banning of specific pesticides.  In my presentation I mentioned Directive 79/117/EEC which deals with this issue.  A number of substances are banned, for example, DDT, dieldrin, lindane and certain mercury compounds.  They have been off the Irish market for approximately 20 years.  If the outcome of the negotiations is hazard-based cut-off criteria, Ireland will lose more pesticides.  If, on the other hand, we can succeed in retaining risk-based cut-off criteria, a number of these pesticides will remain on the market.  They will have to be used correctly by trained professionals but that is a more sustainable approach.  However, we must obtain the agreement of 26 other member states, the European Parliament and the European Commission to come to a final decision.The regulation dealing with the placing on the market of pesticides introduces two principles: comparative assessment and substitution.  In making a decision the authorising authority will examine a substance and apply a comparative assessment as to whether another compound is available to do the same job which is less hazardous or risky.  If so, it can make a decision on that basis.  With regard to the substitution principle, as part of the authorisation, it will be indicated whether the substance is a candidate for substitution by another compound or product.  The decision on substitution should be taken at user level.  I again emphasise the need for training but the decision could also be taken by the person who advises the user.  The decision is taken at local level and takes into account factors such as the level of disease, the build up of resistance and so on.Specific pesticides could be banned but the overall context of sustainable use should be remembered.  This does not involve a ban on the use of all pesticides.Members referred to zonal authorisations.  The question of having an authorisation for zones within Europe, and not necessarily only in Ireland, has been raised.  Ireland would be grouped into a zone in the middle of Europe including France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic.  Such an authorisation would mean a product authorised in Germany could be mutually recognised for placing on the market in Ireland.  We seek a certain amount of subsidiarity with regard to this, particularly in the case of fungicides.  There is general agreement that Ireland has a higher disease pressure from fungal diseases than many of the other member states, even within that zone.  Potato blight, which was mentioned, is a much more serious disease in Ireland than in many member states within our zone.  This is recognised by the fact that many of the compounds and products used in Ireland at present are recommended at higher rates of application than in many European countries.  We will look for a certain amount of subsidiarity, which makes it a little difficult to apply mutual recognition across the board.  However, some flexibility would ensure that farmers' needs are looked after.I am reminded of the question of authorisation for a provisional period and the competitiveness of Irish and European agriculture.  Research and development companies constantly generate new molecules.  They must generate a substantial amount of data to determine the properties of these compounds.  A member mentioned patent protection.  Patent protection is one of the rewards a research and development company gains for ploughing money into the generation of new science and new molecules.  Companies need this reward and an opportunity to recover some of the considerable cost involved — estimates vary from €70 million to €100 million — in developing a new compound.  It might not take a company long to go out of business if it did not have an opportunity to recover such costs.  For every success it is estimated that there are 200 failures.  It is not all good news for research and development companies and this is one of the things of which we are conscious.An authorisation for a provisional period allows a company to get early market access.  This has two benefits.  There is an obvious benefit for the company but there is also a benefit for the farmer, who gets access to new technology or new science.  If we do not have something like that, our competitors outside Europe will have access to this technology, which will help them in their production.  That is what I mean when I speak of reducing the competitiveness of Irish and European agriculture.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	In Ireland, there have been incidents of water pollution from pesticides.  I use the word "pesticides" in terms of being more than plant protection products.  If we are specifically talking about plant protection products, agricultural chemicals as we might call them, we do not have any real evidence of water pollution.  When I use the word "pesticides", I include products such as biocides and wood preservatives, in respect of which there has been evidence of water pollution which was accidental.  As we do not monitor water sources, it would be more correct to direct such questions to the EPA.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I am glad to hear there is room for prevention procedures because prevention is important, not just in the case of potato blight.  Any farmer who wants to keep his or her pasture weed free must use prevention strategies rather than wait for weeds to appear.  I am glad farmers can do this.I have concerns about the NCT-type test as explained.  I cannot envisage a farmer taking his or her equipment such as a sprayer to a depot to be tested every three years.  That will not work, as it will increase costs for farmers.I am glad to hear about new research and developments because modern day farmers face constant change, including climate change, and new diseases appear regularly.  New research and developments can contribute to their control.Europe covers a large area and pesticides suitable for use in Ireland might be the very opposite of those suitable for use in hot countries such as Spain or Portugal.  Therefore, I am glad we will not introduce a common policy to ban the use of certain pesticides in Europe.  We must have room to manoeuvre on these issues.  Irish farmers depend on pasture for eight or nine months of the year and the pesticides they use are different from those used by farmers who keep most of their cattle indoors.  It is important to consider that ours are pasture or grass-based farmers
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The regulation is not aimed at the farmer who feeds grass to his or her animals because it is recognised that his or her use of pesticides is low.  It is aimed more at tillage or fruit and vegetable farmers.On the testing of equipment such as sprayers, the directive provides for flexibility.  I am sure committee members will accept that a person with a self-propelled sprayer who does a lot of contract work should have his or her equipment tested regularly.  While such persons are aware of the need to keep their machines in good order, there is potential for serious problems if they do not.  Many dairy farmers, for example, spray clumps of nettles or docks with a knapsack sprayer.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Must they undergo an NCT-type test?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	33	No, a knapsack sprayer does not need to undergo an NCT-type test.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	34	During the negotiations one of our initiatives was to allow sufficient flexibility to allow an NCT-type test to be undertaken on equipment on farms, as opposed to clogging up the roads with slow moving sprayers on the way to test centres.  We envisage a system whereby a guy can get into a van, visit the farm and approve the sprayer for an additional five years and thus keep the expense to a minimum.  The current wording allows for this flexibility.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	36	No, unless there are further questions.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I refer to patent law.  If a new product which is deemed to be better is the only product that can then be used in the EU context, as opposed to the rest of the world, does the EU producer as a result become less competitive when forced to use a product that is currently under restricted sale through the patent laws as opposed to the rest of the world where crops can be sprayed with something that has been around for years and is cheaper?  This is the point I made with regard to the restrictions.  If the new product becomes the only product that can be used in that context, it does not lead to cost efficiency in the initial stages, even though it might improve the quality of the food.  This begs the question about our standards for food quality.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I may not have explained it properly.  Patent is only one protection afforded to new product research and development.  If a new compound is developed, it must be demonstrated to every authority within Europe and must be to the satisfaction of each authority.  It must be remembered that all member states are part of the decision as to whether a compound is acceptable and is safe and has an acceptable use that will not endanger health or the environment.The review programme for existing products, to which I referred, has been delayed in its completion by approximately five years.  It was to review all existing substances on the market which numbered more than 800 when the directive came into force.  The approval of those substances has been quite slow.  I am not sure of the number approved to date but I believe approximately 100 have been given the stamp of approval and some 200 are still being decided upon.  The final number will be slightly more than 300 out of the original 800 compounds.  In the meantime, approximately 100 new compounds have become available for authorisation.  Unfortunately, because of the way the Commission was so severely criticised by Parliament for not completing the review programme, it has concentrated all its energies on the review of the existing ones and has more or less parked the authorisation process for new compounds until more time is available.  The Commission has a deadline for the existing compounds but there is no such deadline in the case of the new compounds.As a result, the 300 compounds that will be listed as positive compounds for use in Europe will always be available in Europe.  It is not a question of deciding a new molecule is better than an existing molecule and getting rid of the older one; if the old molecule is safe, effective and can be used safely, it will compete on the market.  We are not throwing out all the old science and old chemistry.  This may answer the Deputy's question.The second part is that the data which supports the evaluation to determine whether it is safe are costly to generate.  Protection is given to data for a period of ten years from date of first authorisation within the Community.  If the data had never been used before and resulted from a brand new study, for example on fate in soil, it would get ten years protection which means that if one generic company has this study and the other one does not, the first company's substance and product can continue on the market, but the other company either needs to generate a study, buy access to the first company's study or get off the market for a period of ten years while the first company still has its product on the market.  This was done to encourage the generation of the data so that we can determine whether it is safe.  There had to be some bit of payback.  Otherwise companies would claim it was too costly and would not generate the data.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Are tests carried out on residues in food products, for example?  At what point does it occur?  Is it at processing or at the supermarket?  Statistically are there products that have been taken off the market because residue appears more prevalently than in others?  This is particularly true for food.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-01-09 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Part of the data package includes dealing with the whole issue of residues.  The broad categories or chapters are physical and chemical properties, residues, toxicology, environmental fate and environmental toxicology.  Those are the broad chapters.  The final one when it comes to a national authorisation is effectiveness to determine whether it works and at what rate it works.  There is no point in applying it at twice the rate if half the rate works.  Residues are considered as part of it.  The residue which is expected to be present at harvest, using it according to good agricultural practice and according to the label recommendation, is compared with the level of residue which might cause an effect, the acute reference dose, for instance, or the acceptable daily intake.  If it is found that the residue results in exceeding either of those, that use cannot be authorised and that product cannot be authorised.
