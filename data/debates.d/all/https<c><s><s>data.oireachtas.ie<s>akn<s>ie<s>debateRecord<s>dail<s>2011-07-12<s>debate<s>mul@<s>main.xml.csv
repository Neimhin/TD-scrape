#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.In accordance with established practice, these are posts, the filling of which is a matter for the Government.  Expressions of interest were sought and have been received for these posts.  All suitable officers, irrespective of whether they have submitted an expression of interest, are considered before a decision is made by the Government.The Government this morning appointed Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason, currently Deputy Permanent Representative of Ireland to the European Union, to be Second Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.The new Second Secretary General will support the operation of two new mechanisms at the centre of Government to enhance co-ordination and effectiveness in the critical areas of EU affairs and economic management.  She will have responsibility for supporting the Government Economic Management Council, on which she will report to the Tánaiste, and will co-ordinate support for the Tánaiste in his engagement with whole-of-government issues, including Cabinet committee structures, through an Office of the Tánaiste within the Department of the Taoiseach.The Second Secretary General in discharging responsibility for EU co-ordination will report as appropriate to me and to the Tánaiste.   She will be a member of the management advisory committee of my Department, reporting to the Secretary General of the Department.My Department has a role in supporting the Government as a collective authority, and operates mechanisms for co-ordinating business across departmental boundaries, especially through Cabinet committees and their supporting groups of officials.  It is in that spirit that the Second Secretary General will provide support for me and for the Tánaiste in relevant areas, since in the EU area in particular we have distinct but closely related and complementary responsibilities.  This is a pragmatic and cost-effective approach to supporting key leadership functions at the centre of Government and the precise working arrangements will develop in the normal way.The period since the receipt of expressions of interest, which has been particularly busy as the Government progressed its urgent priorities, has provided an opportunity to clarify some of the issues that are likely to require particular time and attention over the term of this Government.  It has also provided an opportunity to consider the particular qualities and experience likely to be of most value in discharging the duties of these important posts.  Appointments to these posts are being made in the context of a considered view of how the machinery of government at the centre should operate.  I expect the Government to appoint a new Secretary General to the Government and to my Department shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I protest at the extraordinary number of questions transferred or disallowed.  This is the culmination of a four-month effort by the Government effectively to undermine the status of questions to the Taoiseach.  It is very disappointing to the Opposition.  In the past number of months, unrelated questions were put together in large groups and specific points were ignored by the Taoiseach in his response.  An aggressive approach has been taken to stopping questions.  Four of my questions in this group on the same broad topic——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Any question disallowed is done in accordance with Standing Orders.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I have no function in that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Yes, the Taoiseach certainly does.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Taoiseach does not actually.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Taoiseach has been disallowing questions——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I do not disallow them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Taoiseach was in touch with people telling them that certain questions are not for his Department.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The decision on whether a question is disallowed concerns whether the question is in accordance with Standing Orders and it is my decision.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	10	There is an extraordinary desire on the part of the Taoiseach not to answer questions.  Hence, they get referred to the Ceann Comhairle's office.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Deputy Martin should withdraw that remark.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I repeat that the disallowing of questions is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.  It is not a matter for any Department, including the Department of the Taoiseach.  I go out of my way to make certain that no question is disallowed unless it is clearly in breach of Standing Orders.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I have four questions in this group on the same broad topic but I seek some specific points of information.  I welcome the appointment of Geraldine Byrne Nason as Second Secretary General, who is a high calibre person, and I wish her well in her appointment.  On 8 April, the Government briefed the media that the current Secretary General had been asked to step down a few months earlier because of what was termed, with typical understatement, a sweeping reform of the top of the Civil Service.  On 22 June, it was announced that he had been asked to remain for a number of months.  It was an early example of an announcement that was overspun and underdelivered.  Can the Taoiseach accept that his staff were wrong in the way they briefed about the Secretary General's departure and that this cavalier approach has rebounded on them?  In March, the second Secretary General post was supposed to have been filled by someone outside the system.  Has the plan about appointing people from outside the system been completely abandoned?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I do not accept that the staff were wrong, nor do I accept their attitude was cavalier.  A new Secretary General was appointed to the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  A new Secretary General has been appointed to the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs and a Second Secretary General has been appointed to the Department of the Taoiseach, with specific responsibility for economic management control and matters relevant to the Tánaiste and me in dealing with European matters.  I am glad that Deputy Martin sees the merit in the appointee announced today, who he referred to as high quality and high calibre.  The Government will make an appointment shortly in respect of the current Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and Secretary General to the Government.As the Deputy is well aware, a good deal of activity has been going on in the past few months.  The Government agreed that the current Secretary General should continue until the end of July.  The Deputy can take it, therefore, that between this and then the Government will make a new appointment to the Office of the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.These appointments are critical in the sense of understanding the mechanisms and the working of Government.  The position in so far as persons from outside the existing public service being eligible to be appointed as Secretaries General does and can apply, depending on those who submit an expression of interest or who are deemed to be appropriate and suitably qualified.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In terms of both the new Secretary General to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and this appointment it is clear the Taoiseach did not facilitate outside appointments to those positions.  What is his position on the broader range of the highest level of Government in terms of opening it up genuinely to outside competition and to people from outside of the system to apply for these positions?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Deputy is aware, as I outlined previously, that the TLAC is now chaired by an outside person and has a majority of outside personnel on it.  In the context of capability and suitability, therefore, this process is very much more open than it used to be in previous years.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It is not open to the people outside the system.  That is the problem.  Will it be open to people outside the public service?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It has not been to date, despite all the Taoiseach's commitments and promises.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Yes, it has been to date but in these cases, Deputy——
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I do not want to cut in on the other speakers.First, some questions I have also put to the Taoiseach have been transferred to other Ministers which robs me of the opportunity of putting those questions directly to an fear féin.  Ba mhaith liom "Go n-éirí an t-ádh leat" a rá leis an bhean a ghlacfaidh an post nua seo.  There is a question, in terms of trying to open up all of this, about whether any of these positions or any future senior positions in Government will be publicly advertised.  Also, will this new Second Secretary General have responsibility for or in respect of the Economic Management Council and, in particular, how will the Dáil be kept informed of the work of the Economic Management Council?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Déarfaidh mé leis an Rúnaí Ginearálta nua go ndúirt an Teachta é sin sa Dáil agus gur chuir sé fáilte roimpi chuig an post nua atá bainte amach aici.  The answer is that she will have responsibility for the Economic Management Council.  As the Deputy is aware, that is a council which I chair and which is attended by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The agenda for that council meeting will be determined by the Tánaiste's office, together with the new Secretary General.The Economic Management Council meets every week and decisions that are taken in the council go back to Government for final endorsement following which they become public knowledge.  From that perspective, the new Second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach will have direct responsibility for the administration and the running of the council.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	23	What I am trying to ascertain is not when they will become public knowledge because I find that I read more about what the Government is doing in the newspapers than I learn here in this Chamber.  It is particularly difficult to get answers to questions around the work of Cabinet committees.  On his first day in here the Taoiseach made a big play about opening the place up and making the Government more accountable to the Oireachtas.  Has he had any thoughts on how an important committee such as this committee can be more open, particularly to people on the Opposition benches?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Cabinet committees such as this one are subject to the normal confidentiality that applies to Cabinet.  They do not discuss the contents of the agenda or what is discussed at them.  When decisions are made by the council, they are submitted to the Cabinet for formal adoption or are subject to changes that the Cabinet considers appropriate.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that one does not discuss the content of items on the agenda of the council or any other Cabinet committee.  They are subject to the normal rules of confidentiality.  When decisions are finalised, they become public knowledge in the normal way.  I would not regard everything one reads in the newspapers as being accurate in respect of what arises from discussions at Cabinet meetings or Cabinet committee meetings.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Some newspapers are more accurate than others from the Taoiseach's recollection.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	26	This is the nub of the matter because I want to believe what the Taoiseach says, or what he is reported as saying.  The Taoiseach stated reporting will only occur when decisions have been taken.  A committee returns to the Cabinet and it makes a decision, and then the public is told about that decision.  What role does the Opposition have in keeping the Executive accountable in this new Dáil that the Taoiseach proclaims to be more open and transparent and more of a people's parliament?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Deputy is fulfilling that role now by asking questions in the House, to which Members are properly elected.  Part of the Members' responsibility is to ask the questions they feel appropriate.  It is the responsibility of the Government to be accountable to the House in respect of those questions.Deputy Martin raised the question of the TLAC.  It comprises——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	28	No, I did not.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I raised it in the context of the Deputy's question.  The committee comprises a majority of external personnel.  At each specific interview, the committee will comprise three external members and two senior public servants.  With regard to all appointments, or recommendations for appointment, personnel outside the public sector will comprise a majority.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	30	To be fair to the Taoiseach, he has a very good habit of answering questions he was not asked and not answering questions he was asked.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	31	What is the Deputy's question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	32	My question was not about the composition of TLAC, which has always had external members when assessing applicants.  The fundamental question I had concerns the very specific commitments made in advance of the election to the effect that all the posts in question would be opened up to people outside the public service who would be enabled to compete therefor.  They have not been allowed to compete for the specific positions that are the subject matter of these questions.Given that the Economic Management Council now covers such a broad area and is subject to Cabinet confidentiality, does the Taoiseach agree that he has, diaidh ar ndiaidh, extended the cover for his own Department and restricted the grounds upon which it can be questioned in Dáil Éireann?  By virtue of the establishment of Cabinet sub-committees, particularly the Economic Management Council, is it not becoming far more challenging and difficult to ask specific questions about economic activity?  Does the Taoiseach agree that, far from opening up government, he has extended the cloak of confidentiality over many more Government affairs, particularly in respect of his accountability as Taoiseach and the accountability of his office to the Dáil in regard to a wide range of issues?  This goes to the heart of the debate on fundamental reform, the dichotomy between the Executive and the Parliament and the need to create a stronger Parliament, as articulated across the board before the election.  If anything, the Parliament is becoming less strong and the Executive is tightening its grip on setting the agenda and dictating the pace of policy formulation, etc.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The positions of Secretary General and Second Secretary General to the Department of the Taoiseach were traditionally filled by the Government without reference to TLAC.  The new TLAC is just taking up office and all competitions are now open to external expressions of interest.My responsibility as Head of Government is to oversee, encourage, motivate and participate in respect of Ministers' responsibilities to ensure the Government's programme is actually implemented.  The political challenge ahead is to get to a point when we are in charge again of our own economic affairs.  This means overseeing the Government in a way that deals with the fundamental problems of the country.  Many people still do not appreciate the scale of just how far our country has slipped in terms of its economic management.  We have to get back there.Through the Economic Management Council comprising the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Tánaiste and myself and with access to every Ministry if it is necessary, and the other Cabinet committees, issues that might not normally be dealt with at Government level because of the number of issues that must be decided there can be dealt with through the Cabinet committee structure and then be brought to Government for final endorsement.From the point of view of being open, I do not restrict questions from the Deputy to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Ceann Comhairle's office has a function in respect of Standing Orders so perhaps it is the way in which the questions were phrased.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Cabinet confidentiality.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Promoting and supporting research and development, science, technology and innovation, are core aspects of the Government's strategy for supporting enterprise and growing sustainable employment.As is the long-established practice for many strategic policy areas, an official from my Department participates in the relevant interdepartmental group, in this case the interdepartmental group on science, technology and innovation.  This group reports to the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs which I chair.I receive reports and briefings on progress in this policy area through my role as chair of Government meetings, through relevant Cabinet committee meetings and on other occasions as appropriate, for example when I meet representatives from the corporate sector.However, science, technology and innovation policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Minister deals with questions on these issues, including parliamentary questions, on a regular basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	36	This is a very important issue.  Throughout the years, the office of the Taoiseach and previous taoisigh took a central and vital leadership role in science, technology and innovation.  I was involved in devising the strategy for science, technology and innovation, SSTI, which was hailed across the board as a significant strategic step forward in investment in research and development and science and technology.  The Taoiseach and representatives of the Taoiseach's office had a very important role in a whole of government approach and bringing other Departments into line with the commitment to this area.  There is concern that no Cabinet member has expressed support for giving priority to research funding as part of our economic recovery.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Does the Deputy have a question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Will the Taoiseach agree there appears to be a marginalisation of basic research without which there can be no applied research?  Has the Taoiseach met his officials on this matter and will he seek opportunities to address these concerns of the research community?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Government remains committed to strategic research and development investment and recently agreed its goal for the duration of the national recovery plan to 2014 is at a minimum to sustain investment in productive research and development at the existing level as something that is fundamental to underpin the reconstruction of the Irish economy.When I have occasion to meet corporate firms or firms involved in research and development of one sort or another, this is central to the Government's thinking on the redevelopment of the economy.  Last week, I met Microsoft and its analysis of the cloud computing potential is of an industry that will be valued at approximately €40 billion by 2014 and that Ireland has significant opportunities to gain substantial elements of this.  The workforce in the company whom I met were entirely committed and enthusiastic about achieving this type of goal.The Deputy can take it that the Government is interested in continuing the priority for research and development investment.  It is a central part of what the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is always focused on.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The interdepartmental group plays a central role in monitoring the implementation of Government policy and research activity, and the role of the Taoiseach's Department is essential in terms of cross-governmental statistics.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the evidence shows that Ireland's research reputation is at its highest in its history?  From his discussions with his representatives on the interdepartmental group, will he confirm that recently released statistics show substantial improvements in our world rankings on research and that these rankings should be accepted, acknowledged, protected and prioritised, rather than dismissed for political advantage?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	41	This is about our country and its potential for the future.  It is true that enterprise research and development expenditure increased by 31% from €1.32 billion in 2005 to €1.87 billion in 2009.  The share of exports from research and development exporting firms increased from 50% in 2003 to 76% in 2007.  Among Enterprise Ireland and IDA assisted firms, the number of companies applying for research and development tax credits tripled from under 200 in 2004 to approximately 600 in 2008.  We have all made these cases in the House.  The Deputy's party was in government during the years I have mentioned.  Research and development has always been accepted as being an important part of Ireland's progress and will continue to be so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together.I addressed the biennial conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Monday, 4 July in Killarney.  In my speech to delegates I outlined the economic challenges facing our country and reiterated the Government's determination to tackle our difficulties head on.  I stressed the importance of building confidence in our country to enable us to re-enter the financial markets, which means making the necessary adjustments to bring our spending and revenue onto a sustainable path.  I emphasised the necessity of implementing structural changes to restore competitiveness and make Ireland an even more successful location for investment, enterprise and jobs.I made it clear that the decisions we will have to take will be neither easy nor popular.  However, I reassured those present that they will be fair and balanced and will support our strategy of getting the country back to work.  I commended the public service unions and their members on the scale of the adjustments which have already taken place under the Croke Park agreement, while also seeking an acceleration of the process with the co-operation and good will of the trade unions concerned.I also referred in my speech to the ongoing discussion about the regulation of pay and conditions in certain sectors.  The Government is committed to the protection of vulnerable workers and the reversal of the cut in the national minimum wage is a clear demonstration of that commitment.When it comes to the wage setting machinery of joint labour committees, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, the fact is that everyone has long accepted the need for change.  This has been the common view of employers and congress for some time.  The High Court judgment delivered on 7 July underlines the need to press ahead with a balanced legislative reform agenda in this area.I confirmed my intention to follow up my recent meeting with ICTU with further meetings to review the broad areas of mutual interest and concern as part of a wider process of ongoing social dialogue.  I propose to engage with the other social partners in a similar spirit.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Táim buíoch don Taoiseach as freagra soiléir a thabhairt dom.  Tá sé soiléir fosta go mbeidh daoine bochta, daoine atá ceangailte leis na JLCs, i dtrioblóid mhór roimh sos an tsamhraidh.  An bhfuil aon phlean ag an Rialtas chun reachtaíocht a ghlacadh go gasta chun seo a chur ina cheart?The Taoiseach referred to difficulties facing lower paid workers, particularly in light of the recent High Court finding on joint labour committees.  Lower paid workers have been left particularly vulnerable and it is Sinn Féin's view that immediate action is needed by the Government to rectify this matter before the summer recess to protect such workers in the short term.  In the longer term, we argue for proper and adequate legislation to sustain the joint labour committees and address the issues raised by the High Court judgment.  What action does the Taoiseach have in mind to resolve this urgent issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Government made the decision to reverse the cut in the minimum wage and that has taken effect.  The situation arising from the court decision of last week was considered by the Government this morning.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will now proceed with all haste to bring about a restructured response to the outcome of the court case.  The vulnerability of some workers is of concern.  From that perspective, the Minister will move as quickly as possible.There are now limited protections for workers, because of contracts entered into.  This is a matter the Government feels should be responded to as quickly as possible.  It will not, however, be possible for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to have the matter rectified before the summer recess.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Is this not another scandal?  In the Taoiseach's own words, "There are now limited protections for workers".  These are people who are already at the lowest end of the chain.  The Government is saying there are limited protections and the Minister will not be able to introduce emergency legislation to provide what should be, in any republic or indeed in any society, minimum guarantees for them and their families.  Would the Taoiseach not reconsider his response and give a clear commitment that emergency legislation will be brought in?  Sinn Féin would facilitate this and would work, before the summer recess, to ensure these people are not left over the summer break open to being exploited.  Not all employers are exploiters but some are exploiting these poorly paid workers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Deputy is aware that the court decision deemed the structure in place to be unconstitutional.  That applied from the moment of the announcement in the court.  There have been references to this matter in court cases over a number of years but nothing was done about it.  It would not be possible for the Minister to rectify an issue that has been struck down constitutionally with legislation as complex and as robust as would be required between now and the start of the summer recess.  The Minister is aware of the necessity to conclude this matter comprehensively and he will do that when he brings his report to Government as quickly as possible.I note the comments from employers that no serious action should be taken arising from the decision of the court.  This time of year is a very busy period for workers involved in these sectors, although that is not an excuse for saying nothing may happen.  However, elements of legislation that have been there for quite some time have been struck down as unconstitutional.  There were indications, many years ago, that something should be done about those elements but nothing was done.

Everything is possible.  Given the will of the Government and of the Opposition to protect these workers, if we decide to do it we can do it.  What happened to "Is féidir linn"?  Where are all the big speeches?  This is a test of a Government.  It is not simply the full flow of rhetoric.  It is a test of a Government that as we approach the summer break we are telling these people and their families we cannot do anything.  I do not accept that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	50	To draft a response to something that has been deemed unconstitutional by the court takes more than rhetoric.  It takes a great deal of analysis about the complexity of the legislation.  The judgment is 42 pages long, covering a broad range of issues and the response has to be comprehensive and all encompassing.  That is a matter on which the Minister will focus his priority over the coming period.  We would like to think he could have that done by next week but that would not be possible.  Ní féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh taobh istigh de sheachtain amháin.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree this is an important issue in terms of the protection of hundreds of thousands of low paid workers.  In his discussions with the trade union movement, it is clear the movement, in the first instance, sought that this decision would be appealed.  Has the Government received advices from the Attorney General in this regard?  Why has an appeal not been lodged to the High Court decision or an application for a stay on the execution of the judgment pending the outcome of such an appeal?  If the Government has considered such advices, will the Taoiseach outline the reasons, it will not appeal the decision?  We all know of the divisions within the Government on this.  For the past two months, Ministers have publicly articulated in the media different perspectives on the JLCs and how they should operate and their positions on them.  The suspicion lurks that the ball is in the court of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and that he has his opponents within the Cabinet where he wants them.  Why has the Government not taken the decision to appeal the High Court judgment?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	52	There are no opponents in the Cabinet.  This is a Government focused on rectifying many of the problems that Deputy Martin left behind him.  We examined all the possible legal avenues to try to find a way to do this.  The Attorney General has advised the Government that there are insufficient grounds for an appeal and, as a consequence, the Government is focused on the priority of dealing with the outcome of a complex court decision in respect of the unconstitutionality of the legislation.  The Minister will proceed with all haste to provide a comprehensive response to the complex, wide-ranging decision announced by the court.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	53	With regard to the timing of the Bill relating to the JLCs-REOs, why can legislation dictated by the EU-IMF be rushed through but not legislation to protect low paid workers?  Can the Taoiseach assure us, whatever about the timing of the legislation, that it is the Government's intention to ensure low paid workers covered by JLCs-REOs will not be financially worse off than they are now?  That is the assurance the unions and low paid workers in the retail, catering and hotel sectors, hairdressers and so on, who are the working poor, want.  They want an assurance that they will not be made poorer as a result of the legislation brought forward to deal with the issue.  That is what the people and the unions representing low paid workers want to know.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The decision of the court was unequivocal in respect of the flaws in the legislation.  The Government will respond to that and this will be a reform of the structure that was deemed to be unconstitutional and the elements thereof.  That reform will seek to protect workers while, at the same time, allowing for greater flexibility than applied heretofore.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	55	That is not an answer.  It was a straight question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I reported to the House on 28 and 29 June on the meeting of the European Council that took place in Brussels on 23 and 24 June.  While there was no detailed discussion of the economic situation in Ireland, in its conclusions the European Council welcomed the progress we have made in implementing our programme and agreed that it is on track.In discussions with partners, I stressed not only the need to ensure that all elements of a programme, including pricing, contribute to a positive outcome, but also the need to ensure that measures taken to address the situation in one member state do not have negative consequences for another.  That is especially necessary in the case of countries in a programme.The point was well-taken by colleagues, and is reflected in last night's statement by eurogroup Ministers which states that "Ministers stand ready to adopt further measures that will improve the euro area's systematic capacity to resist contagion risk", pointing to a number of possible measures in that regard.  These include enhancing the flexibility and the scope of the EFSF, lengthening the maturities of the loans, and lowering the interest rates, including through a collateral arrangement where appropriate.  Proposals to that effect will be presented to Ministers shortly.Ministers have also tasked the eurogroup working group with proposing measures to reinforce the current policy response to the crisis in Greece.  This includes the modalities for financing a new multi-annual adjustment programme, steps to reduce the cost of debt servicing and means to improve the sustainability of Greek public debt.  The reinforced strategy should provide the basis for an agreement in the eurogroup on the main elements and financing of a second adjustment programme for Greece shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Does the Taoiseach agree that, in essence, the Council has signally failed to contain the Greek crisis because it has delayed everything it does, and it continues to delay?  Since early March many statements have been made but no action has been taken.  It is now more than four months since the interest rate on this country's loan was held to be unsustainable by the Council.  That was part of an agreement also to change Greece's terms.  What happened last evening is a European-wide decision.  We were bystanders more or less because of the fear of contagion in terms of Italy and Spain and the alarm that has sent around the euro system.I asked the Taoiseach about the matter last week.  I put it to him that it is important for him to publish the text of the Van Rompuy offer to him at the meeting of 11 March on reducing this country's interest rate in return for a vague statement on co-ordination on tax matters.  To date, the Taoiseach has refused to publish the text.  It is now being reported generally that this country was not asked to concede its corporation tax in the Van Rompuy compromise offer and neither were we asked to concede on CCCTB.  That begs the question of whether we failed to take the opportunity to get an interest rate reduction as far back as March when we could have got it for very little in return and that we have lost four months as a result.  Could the Taoiseach confirm that this was the essence of the Van Rompuy formula that was put to him on the evening of that meeting?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I can confirm that is not the case.  Deputy Martin's question relates to clarification given by EU leaders at the European Council in June.  In making the case in respect of reporting the progress being made by this country, European leaders were cognisant of the fact that countries in a programme which are measuring up to the conditions of that programme should be protected.  The Council was not going to make decisions about that because decisions were being taken in respect of the response to the Greek crisis.The situation Deputy Martin described as being "reported generally" is not accurate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Could the Taoiseach——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I will be clear about it.  This country was asked to increase its corporate tax rate.  I refused to do that.  I assume Deputy Martin supports me in that.  The outcome of the decision is still being negotiated.The Deputy is also aware that the provision of a wording that might be deemed to be an acceptable compromise does not mean that any such attempt would be acceptable to everyone at such a meeting.  What Deputy Martin reports is not accurate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Why is the Taoiseach ducking and diving on the question of the Van Rompuy formula?  Why will he not simply publish it because then we could make a judgment on it?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Will Deputy Martin put a question please?  The Deputy's time is up.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	63	For some strange reason the Taoiseach gets very touchy about this.  He will not publish the formula itself and he keeps ducking and diving to avoid the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I am not ducking and diving in any way.  The Deputy is telling me that texts were circulated at the meeting of 11 March which would have allowed Ireland to obtain an interest rate reduction.  I am saying to him that I sat at the table representing this country and I refused to accept an interest rate reduction that was contingent upon Ireland increasing its corporate tax rate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	65	No.  The Taoiseach confirmed the Van Rompuy text himself.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Sorry.  We are over time and I cannot allow any more questions.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	68	In line with the programme for Government, I am committed to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First, the national guidance document on the reporting and management of child welfare and protection concerns.  The need for such legislation was already highlighted in the implementation plan prepared following the publication in July 2009 of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  My Department has made much progress in recent weeks in developing the scope and application of the legislation.I will be publishing later this week a new Children First national guidance document.  I also hope to be in a position shortly to outline further details on the policy approach that will inform the proposed legislation.  It is my view that the new legislation needs to extend beyond the reporting of suspected abuse.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	70	We also need to emphasise the importance of multidisciplinary and inter-agency co-operation in the management of such concerns if we are truly to protect children.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure the safeguarding of children.I am attaching particular importance to the need for this legislation and I hope the proposals enjoy widespread support in the interests of protecting vulnerable children.  I hope the implementation of both the revised Children First guidelines and the legislation that will underpin compliance will provide an opportunity to raise societal awareness of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children, and the need for everyone to play their part in protecting children.

It is not clear from the Minister's reply whether she is planning on introducing mandatory reporting with specific penalties alongside her proposals to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing.  What plans is she drawing up to ensure the changes she is proposing will be resourced in a way that will allow the system to operate properly?I note that a couple of weekends ago at the annual conference of the Irish Association of Social Workers there was some unease among social workers about the proposed standardised system being designed by the HSE to transform social workers' handling of child protection issues.  The experience in other countries has been that the introduction of mandatory reporting has led to a large increase in the number of reports coming in, putting massive pressure on social workers.  It is critical, in taking this approach, that the Minister has sufficient resources to ensure the system can operate as it is intended.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The Ryan implementation report set a deadline of December 2010 for the previous Government to draft legislation putting Children First on a statutory footing.  This was accepted by the Deputy's party when in government and it is regrettable it did not meet that deadline.  I have, however, made much progress in drafting this legislation.Putting Children First on a statutory basis will effectively put the reporting requirements contained in the Children First guidance which will be published on Friday.  The approach underlined in this guidance will be reflected in the legislation.  As I stated in my reply, the important element in the Children First guidelines is not just that people must report cases of child abuse, but also co-operate with other agencies.  The guidance outlines a whole way of working to protect children.  It is important this is also reflected in the legislation.  This is just not about reporting but about an approach to the work that ensures consistency.The Deputy is concerned that this may lead to a bureaucratic approach.  As I stated last week when I reported to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, consistency is missing in the implementation of child protection guidelines.  I am pleased the director of family services in the Health Service Executive, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, will have an implementation plan for these guidelines.

Will the Minister introduce a mandatory reporting system, as well as putting the children's rights guidelines on a statutory footing?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I will do what the former Government agreed to do, which is to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis, as recommended by the Ryan report.  Part of this will be a reporting requirement.  It will be a different concept, however, to that where the focus is on mandatory reporting alone which other countries such as Australia have introduced.  It will not replicate such a system.  Legislation will be introduced to underpin the guidelines which are comprehensive in their approach.  They are not just about reporting, but about an approach to the management of child protection cases to which every organisation working with children will need to adhere.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The programme for Government 2011 states the referendum on children's rights is a priority and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the Joint Committee on the Constitution, of which Deputy Ó Caoláin was a member.  On taking office I instructed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to work with the Office of the Attorney General with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the committee than that which the previous Government approved in draft form.Accordingly, the preparation of a draft wording is being undertaken by the Parliamentary Counsel in association with the advisory counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and officials in my Department.  I hope to be in a position to submit the outcome of this work to the Government for approval in the autumn.  It is envisaged the Government will be asked to approve the drafting of a Bill based on the wording submitted and to request the approval of the Oireachtas for the holding of a constitutional referendum.  I look forward, in particular, to the debate among political and civic leaders and the wider public about the place of children in our society, further raising awareness of the interests of children.

I commend the Minister on taking this first major step.At last week's Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister committed to introducing wording along the lines of that contained in the final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution from February 2010.  The period between February 2010 and February 2011 provided the former Government and the permanent government of various Departments an opportunity to evaluate properly the wording presented by the committee.In the short time the Minister has had to engage with her new Department and other Departments, has she had the opportunity to establish how much of the all-party committee's wording was acceptable?  What were the concerns about it?  Does she believe she can introduce a wording that will mirror that of the all-party committee?  Are there concerns in the Office of the Attorney General and other Departments about the all-party committee's wording?  There may have been changes at the helm of Departments but those entrusted with the evaluation of the wording are still in their jobs and working on it.  I would expect that 17 months after the publication of the wording there must be some greater clarity coming back from Departments.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I must call the Minister, Deputy Ó Caoláin.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The previous Government did not come up with legislation based on the all-party committee's wording but with a different formula.  Apparently, this was based on the concerns of the former Attorney General.  That wording was not circulated formally but discussed informally with several non-governmental organisations, NGOs.The Government's priority and intention is to ensure the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the Joint Committee on the Constitution.  The former Attorney General was concerned this wording could have unintended consequences for the State's financial obligations in this area and that they could be considered excessive.  I have asked the Attorney General to re-examine the wording and these concerns, as well as those of various Departments.The Government is determined to bring forward legislation for a referendum which will reflect the all-party consensus at the committee on the Constitution.  The wording to be presented will be along the lines of that proposed by the committee.

Will this be the deadline for agreement on the Government's wording?  Will we see publication of the facilitating legislation in the autumn?  Will the Minister dare speculate if we will see the referendum in the first quarter of 2012?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	80	As already stated, I hope and expect to be in a position to submit the outcome of that work to the Government for its approval in the autumn.  The Deputy will be aware that there will be some further work to be done at that point.  Draft legislation will be required in respect of adoption proposals — this will have to be brought through the Dáil — and  a referendum commission will have to be established.It is not possible for me to outline precisely how long the work relating to these various matters will take.  However, I hope to have the wording in the autumn and it will then be the responsibility of the Oireachtas to pass the relevant legislation.  I will deal with this matter as speedily as possible.  If the wording is available in the autumn, we will then move forward with the legislation on the adoption proposals.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for tabling this question.  The European Commission decision of February 2007 harmonised numbers for services of social value on the 116 number range.  ComReg is the competent national regulatory authority in Ireland responsible for assigning 116 numbers to prospective service providers.  ComReg has informed me that the numbers 116111 and 116123 were assigned to Childline and the Samaritans after consultation with the Department of Health and Children and that the 116000 number has been set aside as a missing children hotline.  The 116000 hotline service operates on two levels, namely, the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities, that is, the Garda, and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  The 116000 service is currently active in 11 of the 27 EU member states.  Funding for the provision of the 116000 service relates not only to call costs but also to the resourcing of a 24 hours a day, seven days a week operation.  How to finance and provide this service has been a significant issue in all member states.The introduction of a missing children's hotline has been the subject of discussions between my Department, other Departments and prospective service providers, including NGOs.  In particular, the notification of a missing child is a matter for the Garda Síochána and accordingly I am in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in seeking to jointly achieve the establishment of this service.  Different costings for such a service have been calculated by NGOs interested in providing the service.  Obviously, in the current financial situation, it is essential that the most economic approach possible be taken to providing any service.  I hope that with a partnership approach we can achieve a cost-effective solution in respect of the implementation of this EU initiative.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I thank the Minister for her reply.  Like Deputy Ó Caoláin, I welcome the establishment of this new Ministry dedicated to children.  The issue of missing children is probably central to its work.In a reply to a previous question, the Minister referred to having the interests of children at heart.  Everyone is aware that in the case of a missing child, the first 24 hours are vital.  The family of Madeleine McCann obtained a high profile in respect of that matter.  Thousands of children go missing each day.  Significant numbers of unaccompanied minors, particularly those from other jurisdictions, go missing in this country.  Do I take it that the Minister is actively seeking the necessary resources to allow this missing children hotline to be put into operation in the near future?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I cannot provide the Deputy with a timeframe but I certainly want the hotline to be established.  It has not been established up to now.  Since taking office I have initiated discussions in respect of it.  In that context, I have discussed the matter with one of the NGOs that might be interested in providing the service.  It is estimated that it will take approximately €120,000 to set up and that a minimum of €80,000 will be required each year for its operation.I understand the Deputy's concern with regard to unaccompanied children who went missing from various hostels in the past.  Such children no longer stay in hostels.  The Garda Síochána previously ran a similar telephone line but because few, if any, calls were received, this was discontinued.  A number of issues arise with regard to the best use of resources.  There is an obligation on us at EU level to put a telephone hotline of this nature in place.  I want to ensure that we will provide it but there are issues regarding its use, publicising its existence and supporting it financially.  I am pursuing the matter and I hope to be in a position to report progress on it at some point in the near future.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	84	A couple of years ago the dial to stop drug dealing campaign was established and a freefone number was provided.  The latter has been very successful and has led to significant developments in the area of dealing with illegal drugs.  This is an example of a freefone line which does work.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	One of the principal commitments in the implementation plan prepared following the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is the need to ensure that all children in care have an allocated social worker and a care plan.  This initiative is designed to target resources at front line services in order to ensure that the HSE can fulfil its statutory obligations.  An additional 200 social workers were recruited in 2010 and the HSE has been given approval to recruit a further 60 social workers in 2011.  The remaining ten posts will be filled thereafter.  The necessary finance has been provided and the filling of these posts has been exempted from the public service moratorium on recruitment and replacement of staff.The latest available information from the HSE indicates that the number of children in care nationally at the end of April 2011 was 6,122.  Of those children, 5,441 — 90% — had a written care plan in place.  This represents a significant improvement on the position in mid-2010 when 82% of children in care had a written care plan.  The breakdown by care type nationally of children in care who had a written care plan in place was as follows: those in residential care, 93.3%; foster care, 89.4%; foster care with relatives, 87.3%; and other care types — for example, at home under care order — 88.9%.  Therefore, approximately 90% of children in all sorts of settings had written care plans in place.The HSE further reported that nationally, 94.6% of all children in care had an allocated social worker.  Again, this represents a significant improvement on the position in mid-2010 when 86.5% of children in care had an allocated social worker.  The breakdown by care type nationally in respect of children with allocated social workers is as follows: those in residential care, 96.7%; foster care, 95.3%; foster care with relatives, 92.5%; and other care types — for example, at home under care order — 95.8%.  It is obvious that 100% of children in care do not have allocated social workers.  However, that is the target.  It would be difficult to achieve it, particularly with, for example, children moving in and out of emergency care.  Allocated social workers may not be immediately available so to actually reach 100% could prove quite difficult.  We do, however, want every child in care to have an allocated social worker.

As she outlined, the previous Government provided funding for the employment — despite the existence of the recruitment ban — of 270 social workers and in respect of additional posts to deliver assessments and therapeutic services for children in special care units and in detention.  As the Minister indicated, 60 of those 270 social workers are currently in the process of being appointed.  Is she satisfied that these individuals — who are being appointed in line with the recommendations contained in the Ryan report — will prove sufficient in the context of dealing with the problems which currently exist in the system as a result of a lack of social workers?  Since she came to office has the Minister carried out an assessment in respect of whether the number of social workers being appointed will prove to be adequate?A recent HIQA report on services in the Dublin north-west area indicates that one third of children there do not have allocated social workers.  In addition, a significant number of foster families in the area to which I refer have not been assessed.  It is critical that we provide the resources to ensure those gaps are filled.  The Ryan report made a recommendation for 270 social workers for which the funding has been provided and is available.  Therefore, the Minister could put the last 70 of these in place.  Has she assessed whether that will be enough?  If she has made that assessment, how many more will be required and will she put the funding in place to deliver them?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	What is critical is that we ensure the 270 are in place and that they begin their work.  I am in ongoing discussions with the director for children and family services in the HSE.  The Deputy mentioned a particular area in Dublin north west, where there are some difficulties.  As can be seen from the figures I have provided, a care plan is in place and a social worker is allocated for a high proportion of children in care.It is important to recognise that progress has been made but there are areas that require a greater focus.  It is not always about the allocation of extra social workers but can also be about practice and management or how work is broken down in a given area.  Where there are gaps in the service, for example where foster parents have not been assessed or where a particular area does not have social workers allocated as one would expect, these are being examined.  This week, I met the regional directors from the HSE and discussed these issues with them and outlined the need for consistency in this area throughout the country.We will continue to assess whether there are enough social workers.  My priority now is to ensure that the 270 are in place and that the work is done throughout the country on a consistent basis and that the guidelines for all frontline personnel are being followed in a consistent manner.  That is how children will be protected.

We need a timeline on that and on when a decision will be made by the Minister as to whether additional resources will be provided if necessary.  I note from the Minister's response that 93% of those in residential care have a social worker, which means some 7% do not.  Some 4% do not have care plans, which is surprising.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	We want to ensure an assessment is done for every foster parent and want to see that children who are in care have an allocated social worker.  There has been significant progress and extra resources in the past year.  We will assess on an ongoing basis whether the numbers being recruited are adequate.  A considerable number has yet to be recruited and all of the funding required is in place.  No doubt the Deputy will ask about this again.  When the new social workers are recruited, I will be happy to report back to him and the Dáil the percentages of children with a social worker and a care plan in place.  I expect to see further progress following on what we have seen in the past few months.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Almost every preschool service in the State is participating in the ECCE scheme, ensuring that it is available to children in all areas, and 63,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, are currently availing of the preschool year.  In 2011, the ECCE programme is expected to cost €166 million.Services participating in the ECCE programme are required to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within the Síolta framework for early learning.  They are also encouraged to implement the Aistear curriculum which has been developed for children aged from birth to six years.  The ECCE programme is universally available, free of charge, to all preschool children and this is critical to ensuring equality of access and school readiness.Clearly resources are scarce, however, my objective is to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of the Government.  A key element of this will be to support implementation of the workforce development plan, by the early education policy unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located within my Department.  The workforce development plan provides a framework for ensuring that personnel working in the ECCE sector have access to accredited training, enabling quality and standards in ECCE services to be continuously improved.From May of this year, my Department has been working with two major voluntary child care organisations to provide subsidised online accredited training courses to staff working within ECCE services.  I hope to continue this initiative next year by supporting training modules which have a specific focus on educating children with special needs and children with literacy and numeracy difficulties.  In addition, I will collaborate closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in implementing the recently launched literacy and numeracy strategy.  Early intervention is crucial and the strategy provides for a range of actions to support preschool children and their families to be undertaken by my Department.Additional material not given on the floor of the House.The current arrangements within the Health Service Executive for the provision of support services to preschool children with special needs are being examined by the office of disability and mental health in the Department of Health, and my Department will continue to liaise with that office.  In addition, I have asked officials in my Department to examine various options for additional provision or improvements to the ECCE programme, in particular for marginalised groups, including children with special needs.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I thank Deputy McGrath.  It has been recognised throughout the country that this is a critical scheme.  Many communities are availing of it and the take-up is very high.  The take-up is not 100%, probably because some parents choose not to send children to early school education and because some children are included in community child care provisions.  Terrific work is being done in preparing children for primary school.  I note in particular the work that is being done in the ECCE scheme with children with special needs.  My vision is that children will be able to avail of a second year.  If resources permitted, that would be extremely helpful for those children in preparation for primary school.  However, it is a question of resources at this time.

The report will cover the period from 2005-10, inclusive.My Department is working to have a draft ready before the end of this year and submitted to the UN as soon as possible thereafter.  Preparatory work to identify key areas of statutory responsibility has now been completed and requests for updated information will issue shortly to relevant Departments. The responses I receive from the various Departments will be incorporated in the report, which I intend to submit as soon as possible.  If we have the draft before the end of this year, the report will be published shortly after that.

The first report was presented in 1997, the second in 2006 and the third was due in April 2009.  While I note what the Minister has said, I hope the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will not see these long and unexplained delays in the future.  Why is it that the report which was due in 2009 has not yet been presented?  There must be an explanation and I hope the Minister is in a position to share that with us.Where does the Minister believe the report will stand on the recommendations of the implementation committee on the UNCRC arising from the 2006 report?  This must include the allocation of resources to enact the outstanding provisions in the relevant Children Acts for the protection of children and also incorporate the convention into domestic law.  What is the current position in that regard?  Also, the general principle of the best interest of the child being a primary consideration must be fully integrated into all legislation relevant to children.The final recommendation is that social work services provided to families and children at risk be extended to cover seven days per week and 24 hours per day.  These are the four critical points from the 2006 report.  Where will we stand in regard to them when the Minister's report is completed?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I share the Deputy's concern regarding the delay in responding to the UN.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which comprises 54 articles, is the most widely ratified international human rights instrument and the first legal instrument to focus solely on children's rights regardless of place of birth, sex, religion or social origin.  The preparation of the report is a priority for my Department.  There are key issues to be considered, including the provision of a 24-hour service.  Progress has been made in that regard, with two pilot projects in place.  A report on the outcome of those projects will be submitted to me before the end of the year, which will enable me to assess the feasibility and cost of extending that type of service to other locations.  I will incorporate those findings into the report to be sent to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.

Does she agree that early intervention is key in terms of preventing problems for children when they reach second level education and beyond, if they get that far?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I agree that early intervention is key.  That is not in doubt.  Last week I attended a meeting of EU health Ministers where it was emphasised that we ought to be thinking in terms of equal opportunities for children with communication disorders given that one in three, one in four and one in five children, respectively, will be born with a visual, speech or hearing difficulty.  By the time children enter primary school, 20% have difficulties to do with hearing.  Early screening and assessment of these problems is the best way to ensure children's rights, as articulated in the UN convention, are met in this State.  We have much work to do not only in terms of early intervention but also in respect of child protection.  The Health Service Executive's director of child and family services, a recently recruited international expert, has said that our child protection system is not fit for purpose and that a great deal of work remains to be done.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  In September 2010, the first full year of the programme, 63,000 children participated, amounting to 94% of all eligible children.  Some 4,300 preschool services, or 95% of all services, are participating in the programme, thus ensuring it is available to children in all areas.Children qualify for the free preschool year where they are aged more than three years and two months and less than four years and seven months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2011.  Exceptions to the upper age limit are allowed in cases where a child is developmentally delayed or it is necessary due to the enrolment policies of local primary schools.Exceptions to the lower age limit are not allowed under the ECCE programme.  This is because the objective of the preschool year is to make early learning in a formal setting available to children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, participating services are expected to provide age-appropriate activities to children.  This requires targeting the preschool year at a particular age cohort limited by minimum and maximum age limits.  It is considered that the eligibility range, which spans almost 17 months, is reasonable.Subject to the local enrolment policies of primary schools, parents are entitled to enrol their children in primary school in the September in which they reach four years of age.  In practice, the majority of parents choose to commence their children in primary school when they are aged between four years and six months and five years and six months.  While targeting a specific age cohort, the ECCE programme has also tried to facilitate the preference of as many parents as possible.  The fact that some children continue to be enrolled in primary school when they are not more than four years and two months and that this means they cannot avail of the preschool year was the subject of a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The complaint was not upheld.It is difficult to achieve a cut-off point in any scheme which accommodates the preferences of everyone.  Inevitably, there are those who fall just outside any age range.  Nevertheless, as a new, universally available and free programme intended to precede entry to primary education, the ECCE scheme provides a beneficial basis for all parents to plan their child's early education.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I thank the Minister for her reply.  Would it not make sense to synchronise the starting ages for preschool and primary school?  Under the preschool scheme, children born in July and August must wait until they are five years old to start school if they are to avail of the scheme.  How many children are impacted by this anomaly?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I do not have those figures to hand.  However, as I have said, the scheme has enjoyed a very high take-up rate, with 94% of all eligible children participating.  The 17-month eligibility range was seen to provide a broad enough range to encompass the vast majority of children within the appropriate age cohort.  It is legally permissible for children to commence primary school once they have reached four years of age, but it could be said there is a preference inherent in the scheme in that children born in July and August must wait until they reach five years of age to commence primary education.  Cases have been brought to my attention where parents are eager to avail of the preschool year but also want their child to start school having just reached the age of four.The decision was taken prior to my arrival on the basis that the 17-month range was preferable in terms of providing the type of preschool experience that would best benefit children.  That criterion has been appealed to the Ombudsman, who found in favour of the Department and that the age range was acceptable.  There will always be children who fall outside the cohort.  From a policy point of view, this age range was seen as the most appropriate for preschool services.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Is it the Minister's view that children who have just reached four years of age are too young to start primary school?  Is there an intention to change the legal age and, if so, is one of the reasons for the age restriction in the preschool scheme to encourage children to commence primary school at a later age?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The legal situation is that children may commence primary education at the age of four.  Beyond that it is a question of parental choice.  Ideally, I would like to see a situation in Ireland similar to that in other European countries where two years of preschool education are provided for young children.  It is universally recognised that a two-year period of early education from three to five years of age is extremely beneficial.  I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that early intervention offers great scope to support and assist children and families.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	107	On the preschool year of early education for children, there was previously provision in the regulations for children with special needs to avail of a second year of preschool education.  Has the Minister any plans to continue with that provision?  I know it has been discontinued from September 2011 but will she overturn that decision and allow children with special needs to avail of a second year of early education?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	108	As I said earlier, I would like to see a situation where children with special needs would have a second year.  When the scheme was introduced originally, it began in January and those children who attended from January to June were then allowed to take a second year.  There has been some misunderstanding but there was never actually a second year available, although clearly it would be of great benefit to many children if it were available.  I said earlier that it is primarily a financial consideration at this stage.  It would be about 10% of the cohort and would cost some €15 million plus administrative costs, which is a considerable financial outlay.  It would be extremely beneficial but I have no plans to do so at present.  As a vision for the early school years, I would like to see it in place.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	109	As I indicated in my reply to Deputy McConalogue, I will be launching the new Children First national guidance later this week.  I also hope to be in a position to outline shortly the details of the legislation to underpin Children First.  The Government has committed, in the programme for Government, to this legislation and I have made considerable progress in recent weeks in developing the scope of the legislation and the policy that would underpin it.It is my view that the legislation to underpin Children First needs to set out a more broadly based approach to compliance than that of reporting alone.  I have already addressed this in an earlier question.  In order for such legislation to have greater effect and to be really meaningful, it should also focus on the need for multidisciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of child welfare and protection concerns.  We need different organisations working well together if we are to protect children.  We need people making reports at an early stage, passing on of concerns and sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children.  A proactive approach by all agencies who work with children which seeks to safeguard their interests and welfare is preferable to a narrow view that responsibilities are discharged when a report is made.  It is not enough simply to make a report.The experience of mandatory reporting in other jurisdictions such as parts of the United States, Australia and Canada, is that its introduction can see an upsurge in reporting but weaknesses in the quality of reporting and the necessary collaboration between professionals and agencies needed to protect children.  This has undermined the potential benefits.The new Children First national guidance for 2011 will be published later this week.  We will have an implementation plan from the HSE to ensure there is consistency in reporting of cases across the country by professionals involved in all organisations, voluntary and statutory, faith based and otherwise.  The implementation of the new Children First national guidance and its subsequent statutory underpinning are intended to strengthen our child protection system and make clear the obligations to protect, report and respond to circumstances where the abuse or welfare of children is at risk.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	110	This is the first time I have had the opportunity to ask the Minister a question in the Dáil since her appointment.  I would like to take the opportunity once again of congratulating her and wishing her every success.In my question I refer to the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  The most recent findings of the Roscommon, Kelly Fitzgerald, the Murphy and the Kilkenny reports demonstrate clearly that very little has changed.  What is common to these reports is the very poor communication between the service providers, the HSE and the Garda Síochána.  What is also common to those reports are the strong recommendations for mandatory reporting governed by statute.  In the case of the professionals providing the services to children, such as teachers, doctors, nurses, youth workers, staff in professional crèches and so on, would the Minister agree that they should be legally obliged by statute to report abuse or suspected abuse?I heard what the Minister had to say to Deputy McConalogue on the reporting requirements, but I think we would not have full child protection without the introduction of mandatory reporting.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is interesting that recent reviews of the Children First guidelines, and we will have an updated version of those later in the week, have found them to be robust and appropriate.  What is really important — and this is what makes the difference — is implementation.  We must focus on implementation.  It is not simply about reporting.  We must insist that people report their concerns.  I agree with the Deputy that if somebody has in good faith reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of a child, those concerns should be reported to the relevant authority.  The legislation, which I intend to bring forward, and which has been recommended by the Ryan report will underpin the good practice outlined in Children First.  The reporting requirement, and I wish to restate this, is only one element.  What is really important is that we have a broadly based approach to compliance.  It has to be greater than reporting alone.  As Deputy McConalogue rightly stated, if one simply focuses on reporting, one gets an increase in reporting without actually protecting children.  What we want to see is a change in practice, consistency and implementation and agencies working well together.  The best way of doing that is to have legislation that is broadly based, which focuses not only on reporting, but on best practice, inter-agency working and consistent implementation.  That is the goal of the legislation.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I thank the Minister for that very concise reply.  My concern is that members of the profession to which I referred might shy away from reporting and I hear what the Minister is saying on full implementation.  Without a legislative requirement, how can we be guaranteed full implementation?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I welcome the Minister's commitment to legislate in line with the Children First guidelines.  The Children First guidelines refer also to neglect by omission, for example the lack of intellectual stimulation, children missing school and the deprivation of intellectual stimulation as a result of that and how that might affect their later development.  What role does the Minister see herself having in implementing Children First guidelines?  The sentiment of legislation in this area may be admirable but how will the Minister apply this to cuts and caps on special needs assistants, the lack of which I know for certain in many cases means that some children will have support for only one hour's schooling a day?  How will she ensure these children's rights are vindicated in terms of the proper provision of the supports necessary for them to attend school?

Has progress been made on the first report of the Oireachtas joint committee on soft information?  One must recognise that in responding to abuse in this particular instance, the soft information element should also be considered, which is not absolutely addressed in the provisions of the Children First legislation.  I would commend taking both together if at all possible and putting them on a statutory footing.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I welcome the Minister's reply.  She is correct that there must be consistency in the implementation.  She referred in her reply to the need to have the agencies working well together, but we do not appear to have joined-up thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to the issues.  Is the Minister confident that the different agencies will operate joined-up thinking and deliver a service that can be held to account?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	116	On reading the Children First guidelines and compliance, it is clear there is a reporting requirement in the guidelines.  The legislation will reflect that.  Professionals mentioned will be under an obligation to report, as they are at present, and that will be reflected in legislation.Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on neglect, it is important to highlight that area.  This is a serious issue and child abuse by neglect or omission is a serious aspect of it.  It is the largest and fastest-growing area where children suffer.  This is particularly true with drugs and alcohol issues in young families.  Children under five years of age are placed in untenable circumstances and are increasingly being brought to the attention of the authorities.  The range of services outlined is important in ensuring children reach their full potential.  It is clearly a question of resources and ensuring that those resources are available so children with a range of issues reach their potential.  In terms of reporting, neglect is one of these areas.  We saw that in the Roscommon report and it needs to get more attention.  It has not received the kind of attention and reporting it needs.  The HSE has the authority to intervene in familial and extra-familial cases.Regarding Deputy Ó Caoláin's question on soft information, progress has been made and the heads of the Bill will be published.  Deputy Shatter and I have been working on it and progress has been made.  We expect the legislation this year.  I support the point made by Deputy Buttimer regarding agencies working well together.  That is why the legislation I will introduce is not simply about reporting but about reflecting the contents of the Children First document.  Agencies must work well together and there must be inter-agency co-operation.

Will the proposals she will bring forward at the end of the week include mandatory reporting?  The Sunday before last, an article in The Sunday Times contained details of what the measure will involve.  There is the option of dismissal procedures being taken against nurses and teachers if they fail to report, meaning that it is mandatory.  This is a simple “Yes” or “No” question.  Will mandatory reporting be introduced as part of the proposals?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Every time the Taoiseach gets asked a tough question, he attacks the person asking the question and avoids answering it.  He did the same last week when he described it as pathetic that his broken promise to Roscommon hospital was raised.  He said: "I am getting a little fed up of the Deputy putting words in my mouth".  The Taoiseach demanded that we show him the quotes.  What he did not count on was that Niamh Connolly of The Sunday Business Post had a recording of the exact words spoken by the Taoiseach on this issue.  The Taoiseach was caught out.  As reminder he said: “And I don’t come down here lightly to say these words”.  The Taoiseach said to the people of Roscommon that the accident and emergency services would be maintained and he attacked what he called “decisions made for Roscommon Hospital by bureaucratic people in a room far away from here”.  With solemn flourish, the Taoiseach said: “And I want you to understand this: I have defended the nurses and the doctors and the workers and the people of Roscommon over the years about this hospital, and will do so again”.  Not only this, the deputy leader promised he had the answer to doctor shortages and safety issues.  Nothing new has been raised by HIQA since February.It emerged today that HIQA has never set foot in Roscommon hospital.  The idea that the view of HIQA on Roscommon hospital suddenly changes everything is ludicrous.  Will the Taoiseach finally take this opportunity to come clean and admit that he and his party promised to keep the services open in full knowledge of the issues the hospital faced in a crass but effective effort to take two seats for the Fine Gael Party in Roscommon?  Will the Taoiseach correct the public record as per a statement on RTE on Sunday?  Will he correct the record of this House, which was misled last week?

The party policy in respect of Roscommon hospital was published in the local papers and publicly known before I arrived in Roscommon.  The first mention of the situation being unsafe in Roscommon hospital arose in the Mallow report, which as the Deputy is aware was published after the general election.The position is that were I not to accept the clinical evidence of the independent health regulator and say that everything was fine in Roscommon hospital and in a number of other small hospitals around the country where similar issues arose and something were to happen in that accident and emergency department, I would have neither conscience nor cover.  The position is that when it became clear to me and to the Minister for Health that the situation in Roscommon hospital is not as it should be the decision was made to redesign and restructure the services for Roscommon hospital.  From that point of view I continued to reiterate Fine Gael Party policy around the country and espoused it in Roscommon the same as anywhere else.  It is not by some surreptitious means that a public address and an interview suddenly become known.  I reiterated and enunciated our party position, given in good faith at that time in Roscommon——

During the election both the Taoiseach and the Labour leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, promised to maintain services at Roscommon hospital.  By claiming today, and since he reversed that commitment, that the 2011 HIQA report means that he has no option but to close accident and emergency services at Roscommon hospital, he compounds the offence because he knew the HIQA position before that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Patients regarded by the palliative care nurses as requiring some treatment in hospital can have their transfer to Roscommon hospital effected by ambulance.  This would not be constituted as an emergency because it would not be an accident and emergency case.  It is common sense that elderly people in receipt of palliative care should be, on the determination of the palliative care nurse, doctor and a consultant, enabled to be transported to Roscommon hospital by ambulance.  That will apply.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I remind Deputies that this is Deputy Adams's question.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	218	When Fianna Fáil used the 2009 HIQA report to justify the withdrawal of emergency services from Ennis hospital, the current Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, rightly accused the then Government of starving smaller hospitals of resources to make them unsafe and of then producing reports to prove this and justify their closure.  This is precisely what the current Government has just done.The solution to a hospital that is unsafe is to make it safe.  To decide there are no alternatives just shows a complete lack of vision and imagination.  I spoke to the Roscommon hospital action group.  I do not have time to tell Members what it told me; suffice it to say it challenged in great detail the figures put forward by the Minister for Health on various claims he made in the past week or so.  I am sure Sinn Féin's health spokesperson, Deputy Ó Caoláin, will raise these issues again.I want to follow the logic of what the Taoiseach is saying today.  He says he accepts the HIQA recommendation in respect of Roscommon hospital.  HIQA has recommended that nine other hospitals be downgraded and lose essential services.  Can the Taoiseach confirm this?  In the interest of telling the people the truth, can he tell us which hospitals will lose emergency services and when those services will be withdrawn?  Does he not accept that what he is doing in Roscommon is what Fianna Fáil did in Louth, Ennis, Nenagh and Monaghan?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	219	There is no danger of closing down Roscommon hospital.  There is every potential for it to play a fundamental part in the delivery of an effective health service that regards patient care as central.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The GPs do not even believe that.  It is the ambulance drivers he is looking to.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Sinn Féin's Minister in Northern Ireland recommended the closure of three emergency departments in favour of a nurse-led service.  In Roscommon, there is a doctor-led service, including a GP-led out-of-hours service.The HIQA report stated there are risks associated with a number of hospitals and that these must be addressed.  If the Deputy follows his own logic, he will note that even if one deployed in Roscommon hospital tomorrow all the medical personnel who have not been there for quite some time, the throughput in the accident and emergency unit would be such that those specialists would become de-skilled in a very short period.  That would not be acceptable in any circumstances.I have outlined that change will occur in Roscommon and that it will be effected with the consequent introduction of other services in the hospital over a certain period.  This will be dealt with by the Minister for Health in due course.  I agree with the Deputy that it is necessary to have absolute clarity in terms of the effecting of the strategy for change.  People are entitled to know what happens.  There should not be any confusion over these matters.  One of the issues that arises in respect of the HSE is that it is often difficult to obtain the required clarity.  The Minister for Health will now see to it that the strategy applies in all cases so people will be informed irrespective of how difficult the change might be.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Does the Taoiseach realise what a contemptible figure he cuts today coming into the Dáil and using the most pathetic excuses to cover up what is a cynical betrayal of the people of Roscommon, in whose hospital he pledged to protect the emergency services?  How pathetic is it to use HIQA as an alibi?  It makes the young fellow who offers the excuse of the dog having chewed his homework positively credible by contrast.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The Taoiseach and his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, who are beside him, solemnly pledged to secure the accident and emergency services for the people of Roscommon and the greater district.  It is a sorry set of circumstances in which three of the most senior members of the Government are shamelessly prepared to resign from their solemn pledge and pretend it is excusable to do so.  They should be referred to as the "Roscommon Three" from now on, or perhaps "the troika".
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Could the Deputy ask his question?

The second demand, which would be of the third member of the troika, the Minister for Health, would be for him to apologise for and withdraw the absolute falsehood he propagated in the Dáil, namely, that the mortality rate in Roscommon was 21% by contrast with 5% in other hospitals.  That is a palpable falsehood.  It has been demonstrated as such and it is another alibi to cover up the betrayal——

My first duty is to the people and the country, not to any individual location in the country.  I made it perfectly clear that the evidence and advice from the independent health regulator, with whose findings the Deputy seems to want to interfere in respect of its findings, demonstrate beyond "yea" or "nay" that the situation in Roscommon is unsafe.  I cannot accept that we should continue with such a situation.  At a meeting between HIQA, the HSE, the Minister for Health and local representatives, this matter was discussed quite clearly.  The decision to effect change and to reconfigure and redesign the services for the people of Roscommon was entered into.

Senator John Crown, also a hospital consultant, has confirmed this and stated it brings into question the research on which Dr. Reilly is basing the entire hospital reconfiguration programme.  At worst, Roscommon had the same coronary death rate as Galway hospital.  This is the reality of the situation.

With regard to mortality rates, Ireland performs well compared to other countries with an in-hospital mortality rate within 30 days of 7.2 per 100 admissions.

I have never made any suggestion other than that there are deep and difficult decisions and reforms to be made and we will face them in as fair and balanced fashion as we can.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of major national importance, namely, the very serious situation that has arisen following the recent High Court decision on the joint labour committee system, the impact of this ruling and the anxiety it has caused to thousands of vulnerable workers and their families throughout the country.
#EricJByrne	unknown-#EricJByrne-party	unknown-#EricJByrne-dob	unknown-#EricJByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the High Court judgment of last Thursday, 7 July, which found the JLC agreements to be unconstitutional.  This decision, unless urgently addressed by government, has the potential to cause considerable chaos and distress to working people because of the significant drop in income that will follow.  Their families will face a noticeable lowering of their standard of living and it will cause considerable damage to the economy through loss of demand because of the significant loss of income that will ensue.  I therefore request that this matter be dealt with urgently and that the Dáil is adjourned to do so.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil on a question of national importance, namely, to discuss the 10% increase in electricity prices being imposed by Bord Gais, its application to increase gas prices and the real and serious consequences this will have for many families,  particularly the elderly who are already struggling to pay their household heating bills.  This move will push many into arrears and cause an almost certain jump in the number of disconnections which could have tragic consequences in the months ahead if it is allowed to happen.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Under the provisions of Standing Order 32 I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann to discuss an issue of major public importance requiring consideration, namely, the parliamentary and democratic process of holding an election for the office of President of Ireland given that this process was ignored by Fine Gael last weekend for party political advantage and that the process as set down——

As Deputies are aware, the use of guillotines to limit debate is not effective.  There should not be a limitation imposed on the debate on a Bill which seeks to set aside the provisions of the Official Languages Act relating to the simultaneous publication of Acts of the Oireachtas in both the Irish and English languages.  This proposal is part of an ongoing erosion of the status of the Irish language which was established by this House.  The guillotine should be lifted to allow all Deputies to partake in a debate on the erosion of the status of our language, an Gaeilge, and the provisions and protections it has gained only recently through the Official Languages Act.  For the second time in one month, a Bill is before the House which seeks to set aside the provisions of the Act.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Based on the number of speakers whose names have been entered to speak on the Bill, it does not seem the legislation will go the distance.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	356	Three months ago, the Government briefed the media that a judicial referendum would be held in October.  It promised consultation with the Opposition and stakeholders, none of which has happened.  The Minister for Justice and Equality toured the media in recent days attacking the posting online of a document from the Judiciary on this issue.  He was outraged that the document had been published but he ignored the fact that the Government had leaked it and briefed against the Judiciary.  Even the Judiciary accepts that pay should be reduced but the situation has gotten out of hand.  There should be no need for the contention that exists.

I suggest he raises it at the Whips meeting tomorrow night.

The grounds for an appeal have been advised by the Attorney General as not being sustainable.  This is complex legislation and a constitutional decision was made in respect of it by the court.  The Government will respond to this in a comprehensive fashion as a matter of priority led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am acutely aware of the statement made by employers that nothing untoward should happen in this regard.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government made a decision to reverse the cut in the minimum wage but the legislation will protect vulnerable workers and reform a system that everybody understands needs reform but in respect of which nothing has been done for more than 30 years.

This morning there was a one hour discussion on my local radio station, Limerick's Live 95 FM——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I am sure it was very interesting but the Deputy should refer to promised legislation.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	412	It was quite an informative discussion, a Cheann Comhairle.  I will be brief in developing the point.  I ask you to allow me to finish on this occasion.  All the contributors to the discussion are service providers in the hospitality sector.  All of them, bar one, openly admitted to not passing on the reduction in VAT to consumers.  My question to the Taoiseach is whether he has proposals, legislative or otherwise, to compel service providers to pass on the VAT reduction to consumers.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Is there promised legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The legislation was introduced to give effect to the reduction in VAT.  The people of whom Deputy Collins speaks are letting down their country and the people.  We had enough of the rip-off situation that applied in a range of sectors.  This initiative was designed to stimulate the indigenous economy because, as the Deputy is aware, tourism and the hospitality sector is one area where jobs and growth can take place, and as a consequence economic expansion can occur.  I thank Deputy Collins for bringing it to the notice of the Dáil.I will bring the Minister's attention to the programme to which the Deputy referred.  It is a disgrace that people who are in a position where they know the reduction should be passed on do not do so.  I was in Killarney last weekend and people involved in the hotel and hospitality sector there reckon that the savings to be passed on to consumers are of the order of €10 million.  The amount is significant and it is a direct stimulus through the hospitality sector.  I thank the Deputy for bringing it to the attention of the House.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I have questions on three pieces of legislation.  I will join two of them together.  We were informed that two pieces of legislation will be introduced to deal with the IMF that must be passed by the House by September.  Given that the House will go into recess in the coming days and will not return until mid-September, will the Taoiseach indicate the deadline?  Will the Bills be guillotined?  With what areas will both of the IMF Bills deal?  That is the first question.  I will give the Taoiseach a chance to answer that and then I will ask my other questions.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Could Deputy Doherty put the questions together please?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The other question relates to the EFSF.  There has been much talk about the changes that came from the eurogroup meeting last night.  When is it proposed to bring the legislation before the House to deal with the amendments to the EFSF mechanism?  The mechanism has already been agreed, and following on last night's decision it will have to be amended.  It has been expected that the legislation, which is currently being drafted, would be introduced soon.  Given last night's announcement, when does the Government intend to introduce the legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	418	There are a number of Bills.  The Bill to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority are to be published by the end of September 2011 as part of the EU-IMF programme.  The heads of the Bill were approved by Cabinet on 5 July.The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 was published on 19 May.  According to the EU programme it was to be published by the end of June.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill was published on 24 May this year.  It was to be published by the end of June according to the programme.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill is to be published by the end of July.  That is on the A list of the EU programme.  The public service pensions (single scheme) Bill is to be published by the end of September.  That is on the EU programme as well.In respect of the health area, the number of GPs wishing to treat patients must be published by the end of September this year.  The heads of the Bill were approved for preparation on 28 June this year.  In respect of social protection, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill was published on 2 June.  That was required to be published before the end of June.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The legislation is being drafted at the moment.  I cannot give the Deputy a date for the publication of the Bill but it is currently being worked on and it should be published before the end of the year.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	425	My question relates to promised legislation, No. 7 on the pink list.  It is the electoral commission Bill which aims to streamline a number of the functions of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and also aims to establish a statutory register of lobbyists.  It is important legislation.  When is it expected that the legislation will be published and debated in the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	426	A typo is at fault.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Constituency Commission) Bill should have been on the list and has since been published.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Last Friday the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, promised the trade unions and the public, through the media, that he would introduce emergency legislation in the House this week to protect people working in the JLC system from the consequences of the High Court decision.  He made that specific and unambiguous promise.  Could the Taoiseach explain the current position?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The Taoiseach has already explained it.

We were labouring under the delusion, a Cheann Comhairle, that no such promise had been made.  The promise was made and I am asking the Taoiseach what is the position.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	430	No, the issue was dealt with in Taoiseach's Questions and about two minutes ago.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	435	No, it was raised by Deputy O'Dea's leader on Taoiseach's Questions.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."There are many important provisions in the Bill on a wide range of measures.  The Bill provides for amendment of the law on civil legal aid, civil liability, private security services, intoxicating liquor, equality, bankruptcy, maintenance of spouses and children, coroners, immigration and citizenship, conveyancing, taxing masters, personal injuries, solicitors, statutory declarations, domestic violence, official languages and court matters.  The changes are designed to strengthen the law and make it more efficient and effective.  Some of the changes will help to modernise further the agencies that operate under the aegis of my Department.While the Bill draws on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, which had commenced Second Stage examination prior to the dissolution of the Dáil, I have significantly amended aspects of the Bill and added new provisions, such as amalgamation of the coroner districts of Dublin, amendments to immigration and citizenship law and amendment of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the Registration of Title Act 1964 with regard to certain rights of way without the need for court order.  I propose to highlight the most important changes in the Bill rather than run through all 15 parts of the Bill.  Should Deputies raise matters I have not focused on, I will be glad to pick up on them by way of response at the conclusion of our debate.Part 2 of the Bill gives statutory backing to allow the Legal Aid Board to provide legal advice on criminal matters to alleged victims of human trafficking offences.  The provision will enable full effect to be given to the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings and to the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.  Both of these instruments were ratified in 2010 and are in operation in the State.  The legal aid system operated by the Legal Aid Board is essentially intended to provide legal assistance in the civil law area.  The Bill extends this into providing legal advice to those who are the victims of human trafficking so they are made fully aware of the law applicable, of the assistance they can give to An Garda Síochána, of what will occur should a prosecution take place and of the court processes.Part 3 builds on recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its 2009 report, Civil Liability of Good Samaritans and Volunteers.  It amends the Civil Liability Act 1961 in order to give clear statutory protection from liability to those who help others in good faith.  The objective is to protect from liability those who, acting with good intentions, go to the assistance of others who are injured or ill as a consequence of an accident or emergency.  Protection from liability is also provided for persons working as volunteers for charitable or other organisations for the benefit of society, including sports, recreation and rescue.  Volunteers will be required to act in a way that does not contribute to gross negligence, while the volunteer organisations with which they operate will be held to the higher standard of ordinary negligence.  While the higher standard will apply for volunteer organisations, provision is made for account to be taken of the benefit accruing to society as a result of the organisations' work in determining whether it is just and reasonable to impose liability.The effectiveness of the Private Security Authority will be improved by changes provided for in Part 4.  The amendments provide for improvements to the licensing process of the authority, including technical changes to certain aspects of the renewal procedure and the power for the authority to grant temporary licences in particular circumstances.  The Bill also increases the authority's powers to request information about individuals who are involved in the running of security companies.  This will augment further the controls on the management of security companies, in addition to the tax certification and other compliance measures which are already in place.  Amendments provided for in the Bill also facilitate changes in the fee structure of the authority and will allow the authority to appoint persons in addition to its own staff to the position of inspector.  The authority will be in a position to issue a temporary licence to an applicant who is a new entrant to the industry for a period not exceeding six months, during which the applicant can prove he or she has the necessary competence to perform the security services in question.  The authority may in exceptional circumstances extend the temporary licence period for a further three months.A small number of amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  These were mainly of a technical nature, regarding definitions in the Act of 2004.  Amendments were also made to section 37 of the Act of 2004, which relates to the prohibition of unlicensed security services.  The effect of the amendment is to allow the Private Security Authority more flexibility in its current licensing practices.  A further amendment was made to section 48 of the Act of 2004 to allow for the possibility of costs and expenses to be awarded to the Private Security Authority in cases prosecuted by the authority.  There is currently no express jurisdiction to award costs, and the amendment rectifies this situation.Part 5 introduces a new provision in licensing laws.  Section 16 provides for the preparation and publication of codes of practice for the purpose of setting standards for the display, sale, supply, advertising, promotion or marketing of intoxicating liquor.  Such codes are intended as a practical mechanism for promoting compliance with the licensing laws by licensees.  They are not intended and will not operate as an alternative to Garda enforcement.  Nevertheless, while breach of a code will not be an offence, it will constitute a ground on which an objection can be lodged by the Garda to renewal of the licensee's licence.  It will then be a matter for the court to decide under what conditions the licence will be renewed.In the Seanad, I expressed regret that the vintners' bodies had withdrawn their support recently from an existing MEAS, mature enjoyment of alcohol in society, code which is designed to ensure alcohol is promoted and sold in a socially responsible manner.  I expect both organisations to participate in the preparation of future codes in this sector and to support their implementation.  There is scope for using the code of practice mechanism to deal with aspects of licensing law which are difficult to specify in legislation.For example, it can be difficult to define aspects of marketing or promotional activities in a sufficiently watertight and comprehensive manner to restrict or prohibit them.  However, practices which generally tend to lead to excessive alcohol consumption could be addressed under an appropriate code.  Staff training is recognised as another important area.  Moreover, it can be difficult to specify comprehensive standards in legislation.  Incorporating such standards in a code could provide a more practical and flexible way of dealing with the matter.Part 6 provides for several amendments to the Equality Acts which are intended to improve the efficiency of the Equality Tribunal in handling complaints and also to take into account legal decisions at both national and EU level.  The amendments provide that the tribunal may, where appropriate and where neither the complainant nor the respondents object, deal with cases on the basis of written submissions alone; the tribunal may state a case to the High Court and avoid further litigation by way of appeal; situations where mediation has failed, the deadline for application for resumption of the hearing is extended; and the maximum amount that may be awarded in employment equality cases is increased to two years' remuneration or €40,000, whichever is greater, to provide for greater redress in situations of low-paid employment.  This is designed to align the text of national law more closely with EU equality directives.Several drafting and technical amendments were made to Part 6 during the Seanad Stages to improve the text.  It may be necessary to make further technical amendments in this House.The most critical change proposed in Part 7 is the replacement of section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988.  The period for application to the court for discharge of bankrupt persons is reduced from 12 years to five years.  Discharge does remain subject to the existing conditions which are payment in full of all expenses, fees and costs of the bankruptcy, as well as all preferential payments primarily to the Revenue Commissioners and to former employees.  The costs and preferential debts involved may amount to quite large sums.  In a good number of cases the debtor will be unable to meet these amounts at any stage and so may remain bankrupt for some time.  The amendment, however, will give some a chance to recover and to begin anew.Another change to section 85 is that it will provide, for the first time in law, for the automatic discharge of bankruptcies on the 12th anniversary of the adjudication order in those cases.  This will assist in the discharge of long-term bankruptcies and will allow the official assignee in bankruptcy to bring closure to 365 so-called legacy bankruptcies that clog up the system.While I understand there may be justifiable demands to go further in our reform at this point, I cannot accede to them in this Bill.  It would be premature to do so.  We must be mindful of the need to ensure the economic and financial effects of certain of the new arrangements that are in contemplation are carefully assessed to ensure all relevant issues are addressed and their impact is fully anticipated and understood.In line with a commitment in the programme for Government, a personal insolvency Bill is in the course of being developed in my Department to provide for a new framework for settlement and enforcement of debt and for personal insolvency.  The commitment under the EU-IMF programme for Ireland is to publish the Bill in the first quarter of 2012.  My Department is working to meet that deadline or to be in advance of it if possible.  A key objective of this legislation will be to achieve a balance, in so far as is possible, between the interests of creditors and debtors.  The objective also will be to create a system that avoids as far as possible the need for expensive bankruptcy procedures and court involvement.Part 8 inserts new provisions in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 that will empower the District Court to regard as contempt of court failure by a maintenance debtor to comply with a previous court order and to deal with it accordingly, including by means of imprisonment.  The amendment makes clear that, since a civil contempt would be involved, the parties could avail of civil legal aid subject to them being otherwise eligible under the scheme of legal aid.  The object is to strengthen the law on enforcement of orders of the court to pay maintenance.It will also address difficulties which have arisen consequent on the High Court judgment in the McCann case in 2009 concerning the enforcement of orders for the recovery of civil debt.  The High Court found that the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 lacked several necessary safeguards in circumstances where a person is at risk of imprisonment.  Following that judgment, the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 inserted a series of amendments designed to protect debtors and impose obligations on the creditor.  Following a review of the operation of that Act, the provisions in the Bill are specific only to the better enforcement of maintenance orders as distinct from debt generally.I know there are some difficulties at District Court level in enforcing maintenance orders, particularly when they are made against spouses who are self-employed and who are unwilling to make maintenance payments that they can afford to make.  The attachment of earnings system is not of assistance in enforcing payments due from self-employed parents in such circumstances.  Many of those working in the District Court system regard the enactment of this reform as a matter of great urgency.I intend to bring forward a further amendment in this area on Committee Stage and repeal the arrest warrant provision in section 8(1) of the 1940 Act while retaining the section to allow it to be used for the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders.  This amendment will be more in keeping with the principles outlined in the High Court judgment in the McCann case.The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible.  In the meantime, Part 9 provides for some early reform of the coroner system to provide for the amalgamation of districts in Dublin and for certain other matters in the filling of a vacancy of the office of coroner or deputy coroner.Part 10 will provide for a flexible system of fees for citizenship applications.  Part 11 is intended to remedy the situation, following the High Court ruling on 25 March 2011 in the case of Ebere Dokie v. Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights Commission, Ireland and the Attorney General, that section 12 of the Immigration Act 2004, dealing with the requirement to produce documents of identity, was inconsistent with the Constitution.  It will also provide for a flexible system of fees for certain immigration services.On Committee Stage I will bring forward amendments to reflect the discussions in the Seanad and permit the further development of immigration and citizenship law.  I will be fulfilling a commitment given in the Seanad to amend the immigration law in respect of civil partners.  This issue arises following enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010.  It will place civil partners on a similar footing to married persons in the granting of a certificate of naturalisation.I will also be introducing an amendment to give a statutory backdrop to citizenship ceremonies.  These would be dedicated occasions to provide a dignified and fitting ceremony to mark the granting of Irish citizenship to those granted that privilege.  Recently, I arranged a pilot citizenship ceremony in Dublin Castle which went very well.  Arrangements are being made in my Department for a series of ceremonies to take place during the last week in July.  It is envisaged that arrangements will be made for further such ceremonies in the weeks and months ahead.  Some of these ceremonies will take place in parts of the country other than Dublin.  It is anticipated that a ceremony will be held in at the Garda college in Templemore.  There will also be a ceremony in Cork.  My Department is working towards arranging for ceremonies to be held in other locations throughout the country that will be appropriate in the context of residents from such locations being granted citizenship.My proposals will, for the most part, replace existing legislation which provides, in respect of a person granted citizenship in this State, that once the Minister makes a decision, the person registers with the District Court clerk and is given a date upon which to return to swear his or her fidelity to the State.  However, in this regard people are often left sitting at the back of the court and are slotted in between a couple of criminal trials.  Instead of the day on which such individuals are granted citizenship proving to be a memorable one, it is something which some find a great deal less than remarkable.Parts 12 and 13 deal with the registration of property rights such as rights of way.  The background to these parts is as follows.  Part 8 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements and what are termed "profits à prendre”.  The former are rights over neighbouring land — such as a right of way — while a profit is an established right to take, for example, turf or timber from land.  Many of these property rights have been the subject of an express grant and are, therefore, already registered in the Land Registry.  However, where the right in question results from long usage — that is, what is referred to as acquisition by “prescription” — it may never have been registered and one of the aims of the reforms in the 2009 Act was to ensure registration of such rights.  Such registration will facilitate the introduction of electronic conveyancing of land.The law concerning acquisition of easements and profits by prescription has been greatly simplified and streamlined in Part 8 of the 2009 Act.  It provides that such rights may in future only be acquired by prescription on registration of a court order with the Property Registration Authority.  In late 2010, however, the Law Society made a submission to the Department in which it expressed concern that in cases in which there was no conflict regarding the existence of these rights, the requirement to obtain a court order would lead to an unnecessary expense for landowners and an unnecessarily increased workload for the courts.  The Government has accepted the thrust of the Law Society's submission and the main purpose of the amendments to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the Registration of Title Act 1964 in Parts 12 and 13 of the Bill, respectively, is to permit the Property Registration Authority to register the rights concerned, without a court order, where there is no disagreement between the parties concerning entitlement to the right concerned.The proposed amendments will allow a landowner, who claims to be entitled to a right on the basis that the relevant requirements set out in the 2009 Act have been met, to apply to the Property Registration Authority to register that right on his or her Land Registry folio and will permit the authority to do so where a claim has been substantiated to its satisfaction.  In order to be satisfied that an owner's claim has been substantiated and is not the subject of a dispute, the authority will serve notice on the relevant parties.  The detailed notice and other statutory requirements will be published by me in the form of a statutory instrument.  The authority will also publish practice directions for the guidance of practitioners.  The amendments to the 2009 Act also extend the three-year period during which existing rights of way must be registered to 12 years — that is, from December 2012 to December 2021.Part 14 relates to the Office of Taxing Master.  This is an interim measure, pending more detailed reform of the office in line with commitments in the programme for Government and in the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  Part 14 amends the law so as to widen the qualifications for appointment as a Taxing Master.  The post is currently confined to solicitors of ten years standing but will now be open to barristers and legal costs accountants.  In the published Bill I had intended to reduce the existing retirement age of 70 years to 65 years.  However, having regard to the debate on the issue in the Seanad, I was happy to move an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage so that it will remain at 70.  The period of appointment will not exceed five years.These modernisation measures for Taxing Masters are in keeping with recommendations of the legal costs working group and the Competition Authority and with our ongoing EU-IMF commitments to structural reform in the legal costs area.  In that connection, my proposals for the legal services Bill are at a very advanced stage of development.  They will provide for fundamental reform of regulation of the legal profession and of legal costs.  I propose to put in place a new structure for the assessment of legal costs.  It is envisaged that, ultimately, this will replace the current structure that obtains under the Taxing Master's office.  The timeline for publication of those proposals is the third quarter of this year.  I anticipate that the Bill should be published by the end of September.Part 15 proposes a number of miscellaneous improvements of the civil law.  The Bill amends the Domestic Violence Act 1996 so that a parent may now apply for a safety order against the other parent of their child, even where the parents do not live together and may never have lived together.  This will ensure that the full protection of the law will be available where access to a child is an occasion of intimidation or even violence between disputing parents.  Other amendments to the Domestic Violence Act mean that the protections of the Act are available on the same basis to unmarried opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples who have not registered a civil partnership.  In addition, couples will no longer be required to have lived together for a minimum period before one of them can obtain a safety order.  In line with a commitment in the programme for Government, I have asked my Department to develop proposals for a stand-alone Bill to amend the law further in respect of domestic violence.  It is intended that the latter will consolidate our domestic violence legislation into one Act of the Oireachtas.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 is amended in Part 15 so that it applies to any applicable limitation period including the limitation periods set under the Civil Liability Act 1961.  The amendment will also provide that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act shall not apply to a civil action involving personal injuries sustained by a person on board a vessel at sea or a passenger on board an aircraft operated by or on behalf of an air carrier.  I have included the amendments in the Bill at the request of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.Section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003, which came into effect in July 2006, provides for the printing and publication of Acts of the Oireachtas in both official languages simultaneously.  The amendment in section 46 in Part 15 of the Bill will allow the publication in one official language only in electronic format of Acts of the Oireachtas in advance of their printing and publication in both official languages.  I emphasise that this will merely provide for the initial publication in electronic format in one of the official languages.  This will ensure that a version of the Act will be available to the public pending the official translation.  The practical reality is that translations take a few weeks, and sometimes longer, to publish.I assure the House that there is no intention to cease publishing legislation in both official languages.  This matter seemed to give rise to some confusion in the Seanad.  The difficulty which arises at present is that essentially we enact legislation through English and that the amendments tabled are in English.  When the legislative process is completed, the final version of the Bill, as amended on Report Stage and signed by the President, can neither be printed nor made available in an electronic version until the translation has been effected.  This can mean that those who may find themselves being prosecuted under the criminal law and who need to obtain immediate access to information as to the content of an Act on the day after the President has signed it, cannot access the final version of such legislation.  That is simply not acceptable.  It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that legislation be made available in electronic form immediately following its enactment.  As is currently the case, legislation will continue to be printed and published in both official languages.The importance of this can be seen in the context of particular provisions contained in the Bill.  I refer to the new provisions relating to the making of safety orders to the benefit of individuals in cases where there is domestic violence in circumstances such as those which I have already outlined.Following the enactment of this Bill if, in circumstances where the parties have never lived together, a father intimidates and threatens the mother of his child and the mother seeks protection, the Bill will, for the first time, allow the mother seek a safety order.  It would be unacceptable to leave a mother or lawyers representing that mother unaware for some weeks following the passage of the Bill of the final format of that section.We need to address the situation so that immediately upon completion of the legislative process, legislation can be made available to the public in an electronic format.  The amendment will help avoid the risk of a challenge from somebody whose rights are affected by a piece of legislation which is not readily accessible.  It will also ensure that all interested persons will have access to an official text of an Act as soon as it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have included this amendment in the Bill at the request of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.We had some heated discussion on this matter in the Seanad.  However, I  reiterate that this is an amendment of a technical nature which simply allows for publication in an electronic form of legislation as soon as it has been signed by the President, in order to provide instant accessibility to what the legislation contains.  I should mention that the previous Government had made the decision that it was necessary to introduce this provision in the law and it was being prepared to be included in the smaller Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that my predecessor published in 2010.  The proposal has also benefited from the advice of the Attorney General and the previous Attorney General, neither of whom believed there was a constitutional difficulty of any nature and both of whom believe there is a need to enact this particular provision.Part 15 also makes amendments to the Second Schedule of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 so as to make provision for a number of functions to be undertaken by county registrars, with a view to optimising resources and value for money.  The amendments will empower registrars to waive notice periods for intention to marry or enter a civil partnership; make orders in certain circumstances relating to notice of applications to appoint a care representative for persons lacking mental capacity, a function which was conferred on them under section 22 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009; enlarge or abridge the time for service of documents or doing any act; and make an order enabling the title to land to pass from a deceased owner to a successor in title.Inevitably, for a Bill of this kind the addition of some further measures is being contemplated.  These will be small in number and if ready in time, I may seek further co-operation from the House for their inclusion.  These will, if possible, concern the transfer of responsibility for the provision of legal aid for persons involved with a mental health tribunal to the Legal Aid Board, measures that will help the Legal Aid Board to promote mediation, procedures with regard to the disposal of documentation following a tribunal, certain improvements and efficiencies in courts procedures, improvements to the provisions governing the appeals board of the Private Security Authority, immigration, other amendments to equality legislation, and a number of other minor amendments.In the preparation of this Bill, some 40 different Acts of the Oireachtas had to be consulted.  The amendments included in the Bill range across those 40 different Acts.  The Bill is an attempt to address a number of urgent issues in a broad range of areas of the law and a number of areas that have required tidying up for some considerable time.  I hope the Bill will have the support of the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I welcome the majority of the provisions of the Bill and commend the Minister and his officials on its introduction.  It is complex legislation as demonstrated by the range of measures covered by it.  The main headline issues of the Bill concern the bankruptcy laws and the various provisions being introduced to strengthen family law.  There was vigorous discussion in the Seanad on the bankruptcy issue and I will get to that later.  The strengthening of family law, particularly the provisions for the enforcement of the various family law maintenance orders, is welcome.  It would be improper for me not to acknowledge the Minister's record in this area over many years, in terms of introducing from this side of the House much of the ground-breaking legislation we have.The range of issues dealt with in the Bill illustrate how important it is that such a Bill be introduced on an annual basis in order to ensure that our law is kept up to date in the many areas covered.  While I recognise significant work has gone into this Bill, it is not good for legislation to have to introduce so many different provisions at one time and we would be better off to ensure that time is given next year to anticipate a further round of this legislation.I would like to highlight some particular issues.  The Irish Heart Foundation has welcomed the Bill.  However, having engaged with us on some of the provisions covered in Part 3, it seeks greater clarity on the definition of a "volunteer" and the issues of good samaritans, volunteers and volunteer organisations.  The Irish Heart Foundation is of the view that its many members, which include myself, could be included in this provision.  The foundations seeks clarification on what authorisation a volunteer organisation needs and what this means for the liability of individuals who are trained as first responders by the foundation or any other organisation.  It also has some recommendations to make on the definitions.  Perhaps the Minister can reflect on these issues.  Since the death of Cormac McAnallen, a range of organisations has become involved with defibrillators and this whole area.  Many of these people are trained, but we do not know to what standards and many of them present themselves when a difficult situation arises.  I suggest we should look to the advice of the Irish Heart Foundation and any other advice the Minister has received on this issue.The foundation also seeks tighter definitions with regard to the concepts of "damage" and "gross negligence" and with regard to the responsibilities of those who transport people from the scene of an emergency to a place where they can receive medical care.  I do not wish to reopen previous debates, but I suggest this will be a significant issue over the next couple of years.  I assume the foundation has communicated directly with the Minister on the range of issues on which it has concerns and would appreciate some clarification from the Minister in that regard.Section 5 relates to the issue of intoxicating liquor and I read somewhere that the Minister intends to look at this area in its totality.  The figures produced by the Health Promotion Agency today show that we have a serious problem with intoxicating liquor in this State.  The scary fact is that the problem affects an increasingly younger age group.  I am aware the Minister criticised the vintners on the suspension of their involvement with MEAS, but the problem goes well beyond the vintners.  I believe the problem lies at supermarket level and to a lesser extent off-licence level.  Supermarkets, in particular the multiples, have ridiculous offers on beers, spirits and many other alcoholic drinks.  The social media also promotes drinking parties in car parks and people are continually encouraged to buy drink.  To make no bones about it, alcohol is being sold in many of our major supermarkets at below-cost level.  This is hidden and the offers are dressed up in various ways.  There is gross negligence of the law in supermarkets and supermarket multiples throughout the country.We must do something about this, but we may be too late because we already have a serious health issue.  A code of practice is fine and is a good start, but we all know what happens with regard to codes of practice in the supermarket industry.  The code is something nice that goes up in a frame inside the door, but that is it.  The frame is cleaned once a week, and nobody heeds the code once it is put on the wall.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is here wearing her justice hat, but perhaps she should put on her health hat.  As a Parliament, it is urgent that we address the issues of under age drinking and the accessibility of alcohol.  While the introduction of a code of practice is a beginning, there must be a far greater concentration on this issue.I understand there were lively exchanges in the Seanad regarding the Bill's bankruptcy provisions.  I am quite satisfied with the provisions, which represent a major change in the existing situation.  We must allow the changes to bed down and see how they work in practice.  I understand the Minister is intent on bringing forward proposals as part of the bailout agreement deal with the EU and IMF which will incorporate this and associated issues.  Perhaps this matter can be revisited early next year as part of that broader review.  While there is a need to change the law, there is no sense in weakening it to the extent that it becomes ineffective.  Bankruptcy should not assume the status of a code of honour or become like a tattoo.  It has to mean something and must be a strong enough sanction.  The Minister's proposals in this regard in Part 7 are satisfactory.I have spoken about the Minister's track record in respect of the proposals in Part 8 which seek to allow greater access to legal aid.  We had a brief discussion on this matter at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and I welcomed the tone of the Minister's proposals on that occasion.  They are as relevant to this section as they were to our previous discussion.  Unfortunately, even though we are changing the law, many people may not be able to access legal aid simply because the resources are not there.  This is in no small part due to aid being granted to people who should not receive it.  As I recall, the Minister referred to resources of "unknown background".
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I referred to resources "of uncertain origin".
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Yes.  Every Member is aware of people with resources "of uncertain origin".  This is an area to which we will have to return.The Minister referred to his intention to introduce a Bill to reform the coroners service.  It is important that the legislation be brought forward as soon as possible to accommodate the changes that have taken place in this area in recent years.  Technology has moved on, for example, and public interest in the role of coroners and the nature of their work has increased through the intervention of television.  In addition, in the case of unexpected and unexplained deaths, families are increasingly seeking the services of coroners to present a case.  This has arisen recently in respect of several road traffic accidents.  The legislation must be brought up to date with the demands now being placed on the coroners service.  The entire system must be examined to determine whether it is fit for purpose in the 21st century.  In that context, the provisions in the Bill are welcome.The Minister will know from his professional and political experience that any changes to land law do not always work out as one hopes they will.  Nevertheless, I welcome the thrust of the proposals in this area.  On the issue of the serving of notice, the Minister referred to "relevant parties".  Land may fall into use of a neighbour when its owner has been gone from the area for a long time or when an elderly person dies and family members do not know they have a right to his or her land.  The Property Registration Authority, for all its benefits, cannot be in charge of everything.  What provisions are in place to ensure we do not have land grabbing or land stealing?  The Minister referred particularly to turf.  The issue of commonage, and common bog in particular, is already a fraught area without opening up further issues.  Will the Minister clarify what protections are in place under Parts 12 and 13 to ensure land is not taken, whether with good intentions or otherwise, and that people are not deprived of their land rights?  Again, this is an area that will require further consideration.On Part 15, it is ironic that, on the day the President of the European Parliament is visiting us, the House is considering a proposal that would serve to diminish the status of the Irish language.  The Minister has outlined the legal and constitutional reasons for the provisions in section 46 but their effect will be to send a signal that we are willing to countenance a diminution of the standing of the Irish language in our legislation.  That is the wrong signal.  I was not aware that the previous Government had considered introducing this proposal.  I assure the Minister that if it had come before the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party it would have had to be reconsidered.  It is difficult to comprehend that this provision was put forward by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In any case, the proposal is premature given that the programme for Government includes an undertaking to review the relevance of the Official Languages Act and to examine whether its effect is in any way obstructive.  Introducing this section in advance of that review is to predetermine its outcome.  It sends a signal that the Government has a certain direction in mind for the review.I acknowledge the Minister's concerns regarding barring orders and the potential impairment of people's rights.  Why do we not publish the Irish translation online?  We have enough translators about the place and it is far easier to publish content as Gaeilge online than to print it.  It should be made available online in both Irish and English so that nobody can justifiably say they did not have access to information.  In advance of Committee Stage on Thursday morning, I ask the Minister to consider withdrawing this proposal in advance of the review of the Official Languages Act.  Many people in this House and outside it campaigned to have Irish recognised as an official working language of the European Union.  It sends entirely the wrong signal if Oireachtas na hÉireann says it is happy to reduce that status.  As sure as night follows day, if the provisions in Part 15 come into law, they will be included in every Bill coming before the House.  Every Department will take it as a green light to diminish the status of Irish.  Let us put the red light back on ahead of the review of the official languages legislation.In general, I welcome the provisions of the Bill, notwithstanding that more comprehensive legislation will be required in many of the areas covered in the next four years.  Legislative provision regarding intoxicating liquor is of particular urgency.  Health statistics released this morning show clearly the damage caused to society and to the health system by alcohol abuse.  The Government and the entire parliamentary system needs to wake up in this regard.  We must send out a very strong message on alcohol abuse.  Let these provisions be the first of many to strengthen the legislation in this area with a view to clamping down on the abuse of alcohol in our society.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	469	My first experience of a miscellaneous provisions Bill was something of an eye-opener.  The Bill refers to an extensive range of content, incorporating more than 40 Acts.  While many of the provisions are straightforward and some serve merely to bring clarity to existing legislation, the Bill nevertheless presented a significant amount work to get through in a short timeframe.  The Bill was passed by the Seanad only last Thursday, was printed on Friday and we are debating Second Stage today and Committee Stage on Thursday.  That presented time pressures in analysing the proposals and drafting amendments.  Having said that, I understand why legislation is presented in this way.  It is a good idea to deal with so many legislative provisions at once and to tidy up where necessary.However, my concern in dealing with such wide-ranging legislation is the ability to reach a consensus.  We have seen that in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011, especially with the changes to the Official Languages Act.  The broader the range of the Bill, the greater the possibilities that Members will disagree on its contents.  I ask the Minister to consider limiting the number of Acts that will be covered in miscellaneous Bills as I feel that would lend itself to gaining consensus, especially when aspects of the Bill are urgent.  Those parts of the Bill would have an easier passage if their number was confined.Having said that, I welcome Part 2, which relates to civil legal aid.  As Deputy Calleary has pointed out, we had a good discussion in the committee on the role of the Legal Aid Board and came up with improvements that we believe can be implemented.  I welcome this provision and commend the Minister for bringing it forward at such an early stage during this session.Human trafficking is a major concern to Deputies.  The Garda Síochána has identified it as one of its priorities in its annual policing plan.  The Garda has made some moves to address the problem by establishing a human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The proposal to extend the Civil Legal Aid Act to victims of human trafficking is a step in the right direction.  While recognising that, in an ideal world one would like to see more substantive provisions beyond providing legal advice and to extend it to cover the issue of legal representation.  The Immigration Council of Ireland and FLAC have expressed this as well.  However, in the context of the debate in the committee this morning, I am also a realist.  The Legal Aid Board is stretched to its limits and given the current economic situation, that is not surprising.  While resources are stretched and budgets are being cut, it is important that we continually review this matter.  The Minister suggested bringing forward more comprehensive legislation.  When we come to do that, I ask him to consider legal representation for these people.I welcome Part 3, which addresses the recommendations of the 2009 report from the Law Reform Commission which called for clarity about negligences arising from acts of good samaritans and putting the voluntary organisations on a statutory footing.  In these tough economic times, the role of the volunteer comes into sharp focus.  The contribution of volunteers to society cannot be under-estimated and one cannot put a value on it.  Deputy Calleary referred to some of the concerns of the Irish Heart Foundation which I hope the Minister will take on board between now and Thursday and if that is not possible, I hope we can look at the recommendations before Report Stage to see if they can be included.  The Irish Heart Foundation made some good observations that would be worth including.We also have seen how individuals contribute to society.  Over the cold snap last winter we saw how individuals tried to play their part by salting the footpath outside their homes.  I understand that the Bill will not cover individuals and if that is the case, drafting legislation to deal with individuals rather than voluntary organisation will take time but we should focus on it, because we need to provide protection for individuals who believe from the goodness of their heart they are doing the right thing.  The Minister made a commitment during the debate in the Seanad to look at this area.I will not dwell on Part 4, but I welcome it.  Part 5 deals with intoxicating liquor and the culture of drink in the country.  The report published today by the Health Research Board brought this into sharp focus.  It shows an increase in the number of alcohol related deaths.  While many people in the drinks industry are very responsible, a few will buck the trend and use the opportunity to make a fast buck.  They are less than responsible in how they market their products.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act introduced penalties for those who sell alcohol to underage people as well as other progressive measure.  However, enforcement remains the issue.  One only has to sit outside certain supermarkets or off licences in the community on a Friday, Saturday or on any night to see the evidence of the failure of enforcement.  That is no fault of the Garda Síochána because its resources are stretched.  An issue that must be addressed is how we enforce the legislation that is passed through the House.It is important to state that alcohol of itself is not the problem but the abuse of alcohol causes problems.  I am a non-drinker but one has only to read the court pages of the local newspaper to see the damaging impact of alcohol on society.  Cases come before the courts where alcohol consumption is put forward as a defence .  The scale of this is frightening because in almost every case that comes forward, drink or drugs are cited as a mitigating factor.  While personal responsibility is important, we must also ensure that those selling drink act in good faith.  We need properly trained staff, responsible advertising and marketing as all of these factors have a role to play in addressing the issue of alcohol abuse.  Stricter Government regulation is needed in regard to this and that is the reason I welcome this provision.There is no doubt that alcohol advertising and marketing can be a very powerful tool and whether we like it or not, it has the ability to shape attitudes, especially the attitudes of young people.  It plays a determining role in the lives of impressionable young people where alcohol advertising and marketing can be a factor in the decision to begin drinking.  It even goes beyond that as it has the ability to influence their drinking habits.  It is an area where we need much more work to be done.  I have no hesitation in supporting this Part as the codes of practice on how we sell, display, market and promote alcohol will help.Part 6 includes some technical amendments to the Equality Act, which are very welcome, and Part 7 deals with bankruptcies, probably the part of the Bill which has received most media attention outside the House.  That is no surprise, given the current economic situation and the number of people who are struggling with personal debt.  The Department is currently considering comprehensive legislation on personal insolvency for early next year.  What is contained in this Bill is more of a stop-gap measure, nevertheless it is very welcome because every bit helps.From reading the transcripts on the Seanad debate on the Bill much discussion centred on the timeframe, whether it should be three or five years or whatever.  Whatever the timeframe, it will be less than what it is, so that will be a help.  We will probably give it more consideration when we are drafting the more comprehensive legislation.  In the North it is one year but that is sort a timeframe.  A timeframe should be put in place and whether it is three or five years is something that can be debated when drafting the new comprehensive Bill.I welcome Part 8, which is long overdue.  It will go a long way to improving the personal circumstances of those who are the beneficiaries of maintenance orders.  If someone is in receipt of a maintenance order and it is not paid, there are direct consequences for the individual.  More often than not, it has direct consequences on children.  If someone fails to pay a maintenance order, the person relying on this to put food on the table and pay bills suffers in very real terms and very quickly.  It is not something we can tolerate or that should be happening.  When a maintenance payment does not come through, the individual will go to the local welfare officer but the local welfare officer is not in a position to help because a maintenance order is in place.  We need further consideration of the situation.The amendment empowers the District Court to regard as contempt of court failure by any individual to pay a maintenance order, which will result in the issuing of a summons forcing the person to appear before the District Court.  If the judge is satisfied the failure to pay the maintenance order is not the fault of the debtor or is down to a genuine inability to pay, the judge has the ability to change the maintenance order.  That is important because imprisonment for failure to pay should be a last resort.  No one wins in that situation.  The most important thing is that the person relying on a maintenance payment receives the money.  Imprisonment is a last resort.  The ability to change the maintenance order at the hearing can help.The Minister and I are not close in terms of our views on the subject of immigration.  We come from different parts of the political spectrum in that regard.  The amendment proposed by the Minister addresses section 12 of the Immigration Act, following the outcome of the recent High Court case, Dokie v. DPP.  I welcomed that judgment because section 12 of the Immigration Act is a repressive measure and discriminates against people.  I would prefer if it was discarded.  Some will argue that section 12 is designed as an immigration control mechanism but the reality is that it discriminates against people who may have a different accent, look different or have a different ethnic background.  Irish citizens are not required by law to carry identification cards, yet immigration legislation states that non-nationals must present identification on demand.  How does a garda or an immigration officer determine who to ask for an identification card?  It leads to racial profiling, which is why I would prefer to see it abandoned rather than on our Statute Book.  We should not have included it in this legislation.The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which has been kicked from pillar to post by all parties in the Chamber, was reinstated on Committee Stage when the Minister took office.  It is high time we had a robust debate on immigration laws in this State.  The opportunity exists through the reinstatement of this Bill on Committee Stage and I hope we can debate it after the summer recess as a matter of priority.I welcome the amendment to this section proposed by the Minister.  During the debate on the Finance (No. 3) Bill, I referred to the need to update our immigration legislation to take account of civil partnerships.  I welcome the legislation and the matter of citizenship ceremonies.  Two weeks ago, the Minister held a ceremony and today he indicated that there will be three more in Cork, Templemore and Dublin.  It is a proud moment for people when they gain citizenship.  If this society does not value it, it is difficult for those people to value it even though they do.  We should make a big deal about it and I welcome the amendment concerning the ceremony, which will help.I also welcome the proposal regarding county registrars because it will increase efficiency and save costs.  We can assign some of the functions currently assigned to the courts to county registrars.I welcome Part 15 concerning domestic violence.  This takes into account the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act.  Abuse is not confined to opposite sex relationships.  It is important to place this measure on a statutory footing.  One of the sections of society most vulnerable to domestic abuse is women who have children by men to whom they were not married and with whom they never lived.  I welcome the provisions proposed in this Bill.  The Minister spoke of more comprehensive legislation to bring together all aspects in this area into one Bill.  I look forward to it.It will come as no surprise that my final comments concern the Official Languages Act.  One of my biggest regrets is that I did not pay enough attention in school and, unlike other Deputies, I am not fluent in Irish.  Nevertheless, I am proud of the Irish language.  My children are taught in gaelscoileanna and I hope they pay more attention than I did and that they are fluent.Our language sets us apart from every other nation and is our one unique characteristic.  We need to protect and foster it at all times and that is one of the reasons why I was disappointed at the inclusion of this part of the Bill.  When dealing with a miscellaneous provisions Bill, which is so broad, it is inevitable there will be one or two sections that do not secure the unanimous backing of the House.  The Minister must realise that proposing this would cause a division in the House.  Perhaps I am underestimating the situation.Given the grá many Members have for the Irish language, apart from the immigration provision this provision was always going to be the one that proved divisive.  We will table an amendment on Committee Stage for this section to be deleted.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider it because, as pointed out by Deputy Calleary, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to review this Act.  Proposed changes should be made in that Bill rather than tacking them onto a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  This does not do justice to the Bill or to the issue of the Irish language.  I hope the Minister will consider this point over the next day or two, and withdraw the section or consider supporting one of the amendments to it.I was as shocked as Deputy Calleary to find out that the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht has asked for this to be included.  Sometimes one has to wonder about these matters.  I ask the Minister to examine that Part because he may be surprised to find out that he will get much more support for the Bill as it progresses.Before concluding I wish to refer to the financial memorandum accompanying the Bill.  It states that the proposals contained in the Bill are not expected to give any rise in significant costs to the Exchequer.  It further states that there is a possibility that there could be a saving to the taxpayer as proposals in regard to the Coroners Act should give rise to cost savings and efficiencies following the amalgamation of the separate Coroner districts in Dublin.I raised previously on the Order of Business the position regarding the previous Fines Bill because we brought in legislation but did not put the resources in place to allow people to pay by instalment.  I do not know how the financial impacts are done when legislation is being drafted and therefore the Minister will forgive me if I am not too familiar with it but I can see, particularly in this legislation which is broad, a number of areas where there might be financial consequences, for instance, the changes in the family law section in respect of maintenance orders.  I do not know how we can quantify the number of people who may end up going to prison as a result of that change.  I do not know how we can quantify in financial terms the impact of the changes in regard to the PSA and the Equality Authority.  I am not raising concerns but would like some clarification in terms of the financial memorandum that accompanies the Bill.We intend to submit some amendments for Committee Stage which we look forward to debating on Thursday.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I am sharing time with Deputies Halligan, Boyd Barrett, Joan Collins and Mattie McGrath.Like the other speakers I believe this Bill represents a tidying up of a diverse range of areas, many of which are welcome and non-controversial but a number of which do not go far enough and represent somewhat of a lost opportunity.  I will comment on a number of those.The first is the area of human trafficking which has not been sufficiently dealt with by the State in the past.  I am not in the habit of quoting from United States State Department reports but I will break with tradition now.  It is an indictment of our dealings in this area that Ireland has been cited by the US State Department as having a very poor role in dealing with this area because while we are ranked as a tier 1 country, which means we recognise human trafficking, we only meet minimum standards and have serious flaws in terms of how we deal with this issue.  We have formally identified only five people as victims of trafficking in the past year, despite the State identifying potentially 78 people in that category.  It is a poor reflection on us that only one person was prosecuted in the past year for sex trafficking offences in Ireland.  The question is whether this legislation improves or disimproves that position.While it is welcome that the victims of trafficking are getting a chance to access legal advice in regard to the State's prosecution of traffickers, as the Immigrant Council of Ireland has stated, in not providing them with legal representation the legislation falls short of what is necessary if we are to truly deal with this scenario.  The victims of trafficking are extremely vulnerable people whose status in this country is insecure and who have been through severe trauma.  They need legal representation.  Could we envisage a cross-examination scenario where the victim is brought to give evidence on behalf of the State against a powerful trafficker who has access to money and resources?  The only representation they are allowed is in regard to questions about their past sexual history and nothing beyond that.  There must be more in that regard.  There must be more than a six month extension to their residency as well if we are to expect those people to assist the Garda to tackle trafficking.The other aspect is the issue of the changes to the Immigration Act.  As Deputy O'Brien stated, this has been brought about as a result of the High Court case regarding the Garda being allowed to demand identification on the flimsiest of grounds where non-Irish nationals face prosecution if they fail to produce identification with what was called a satisfactory explanation, but that is open to abuse and to racial profiling.  They did not even have to suspect the person of committing a crime.  If they had different coloured skin or a different accent and they did not look Irish they could be stopped.  It is not an insignificant matter given that almost 300 people were convicted for failure to produce their identification in 2008.In any legislative position a law must be clear, particularly if the activity is to be criminalised.  The distinction between replacing a satisfactory explanation with reasonable cause is not sufficient to overcome the difficulties.  There will not be any difference in terms of racial screening or the tendency to stop people because they look or sound different.  That is vitally important because people being stopped and questioned by the gardaí or immigration officers on the streets contributes to attitudes in that people wonder what they did and think there is something afoot.  That contributes to racism.  In that regard we have a responsibility to deal with this issue but and this legislation does not do that.The other aspect which has got a great deal of focus is the issue of bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy is a means to provide relief for creditors, where somebody is unwilling or unable to pay their debts, to ensure there is an equitable distribution of property.  These are quite different scenarios because we know of many people in this society with massive bank accounts who were unwilling to pay their debts and have exited this country and taken their moneys and resources with them or signed them over to their wives.  That is a different situation to that of people who are unable to pay their debts and who have struggled to attempt to do so but who clearly do not have the means to address that situation.  It is the case that Ireland is severely out of kilter with our European neighbours in that regard.I welcome the fact that the period has been reduced to five years but it is still too long.  The point has been made that in Britain the period is one year.  We should look in that direction because, sadly, there is an increasing number of small business people and individuals whose level of over-indebtedness has been used to put them into a position of potential bankruptcy.In regard to the need to protect the family home in particular, we must examine legislation in a more coherent way.  There is a distinction but we must address that.  It is a step in the right direction but there is a basis for going further with it.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	472	While I broadly welcome the Bill, I will comment on some aspects of it.  Part 2 will amend the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and enable the Legal Aid Board provide legal advice to victims of human trafficking.  While I welcome the extension of legal aid I do not believe the measure goes far enough as it does not extend the right of representation in court to those victims.  These are the most vulnerable women imaginable.  They were brought out of their own country on the pretence of having a better life here and then subjected to brutality and enslavement.There are two groups operating in this area.  The first, Turn Off the Red Light, opposes all forms of prostitution and from which we have had representation while in the case of the second, Turn Off the Blue Light, I have met its representatives who believe in legalised prostitution in a managed way. Both agree, however, that very many women who are enslaved in the country are brutalised because of human trafficking.A report from the Immigration Council of Ireland states that between 2007 and September 2008, 102 women were identified by ten services throughout the country as having being trafficked through or into Ireland.  These women were aware of a substantial number of other women who were trafficked into Ireland.  The Council of Europe stated this phenomenon has reached unprecedented levels in Europe.  The level in Ireland must be the same as in the rest of Europe.According to the free legal advice centres, the bulk of assistance offered is confined to the limited crime of trafficking.  As said by the previous speaker, very few people in Ireland are identified formally in this regard.  Although all the statistics show that very many women are brought into the country, very few people are charged.  Legal aid is available only in respect of matters connected to the commission of the trafficking offence or any other offence connected to the alleged trafficking offence.  Thus, it does not appear to cover assistance or representation, as necessary, to help victims with immigration or domestic problems, or with seeking compensation from the wrongdoer.  A woman who has been trafficked and who wants to take the trafficker to court has no legal representation.  She is, therefore, hardly likely to proceed to court in the first instance.  This is fundamentally wrong.  We should amend the legislation in this regard.  We should think about this matter very carefully before we vote on the Bill.We are not doing much to help affected women if we cannot afford to them the opportunity to identify and take to court the people responsible for trafficking them.  Under the Bill as it stands, such women do not receive legal representation in court, only legal advice.  An amendment is necessary to allow the Legal Aid Board to provide representation for a victim of human trafficking at the criminal trial of the accused.  The legislation needs to be amended to include representation for victims of the sex trade who do not fall within the narrow definition of "trafficking".  We do not know what is defined and what is not.It is essential that those who are identified as victims be given access to a panel of immigration advisers who specialise in trafficking cases.  They are not at present.  Obtaining legal advice should not involve a lottery.  If we are to do something for the affected women, we should pull out all the stops.  We should not pledge half measures to protect the women.  The women are very vulnerable and some of those under 16 were forced into the country.  We need to do all we can to deal with this issue.  One way to do so is to speak to the women.  If they bring the alleged traffickers to court, they need all the help they can get from the State.  I urge the Minister to consider this, go further and give full legal representation to women who feel strong and willing enough to go to court.Part 5 provides for the creation of codes of practice for the sale and marketing of alcohol.  According to the proposal, if the holders of alcohol licences fail to act responsibly, they could face an objection at the time of the renewal of those licences.  It would then be up to the courts to decide whether to renew them.  This has occurred a number of occasions.  I welcome the fact that new legislation gives legal recognition to the code of practice for the sale and marketing of alcohol for the first time.  However, it is a grave mistake on the part of the Government not to include a statutory code on responsible drinking.I was disappointed to learn that the two main vintners' organisations withdrew their support from the mature enjoyment of alcohol initiative promoting the responsible consumption of alcohol at a time when public concern over excessive alcohol consumption remains high.  I do not need to remind the Minister that a large number of public order offences are caused by excessive alcohol consumption.  The vintners and publicans need to be reminded that compliance with the licensing laws is not optional.  It is important that the alcohol industry meet its responsibility and accept there is a problem with alcoholism.One need only be on any street on any Thursday, Friday or Sunday night to note that publicans or licensed vintners take no responsibility in that they force alcohol into people and give them as much as they like.  The consumers come out of licensed premises onto the streets and sometimes engage in anti-social behaviour or commit public order offences.  The publicans are not held responsible for this.  It is all well and good to hold to account the person who commits the crime but the licensed vintners and publicans must also take responsibility.  I agree that a person full of drink who wants to create chaos in his estate or on his way home should be held to account but licensed vintners and publicans must take responsibility if they are giving alcohol to people who are already intoxicated when they enter their premises.  Nobody should tell me this is not happening because it is.I urge the Minister to consider my points on legal advice for victims of human trafficking and on Part 5.  He should make the alterations I suggest; his doing so would help me to support the Bill.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I agree with those speakers who said this Bill is dotting the i's and crossing the t's but believe it has potential to go a little further in regard to some of the issues that arise.There are two issues I wish to raise, both of which relate to homeowners in arrears with their mortgages who face the repossession of their homes and bankruptcy.  There have been 106 repossessions this year alone.  Over 200,000 homeowners are in serious arrears of three to six months.  None of these people is entitled to free legal advice or aid.  They face the brutality of being taken to the High Court, particularly by the sub-prime mortgage lenders.  The people have no financial assistance to allow them to obtain a barrister or solicitor, which could cost €10,000 or more.  They are already in arrears of €40,000 to €60,000 and face a High Court judge.This Bill presents an opportunity to address this problem and I will table an amendment with this in mind.  I hope I obtain the support of the Minister because the issue will become very serious.  People cannot afford legal costs and are entering the courts undefended.  They face big companies with money and power and they feel very distraught and distressed, which in some circumstances leads to suicidal tendencies.  These emotions were very much reflected at a convention we were able to organise and assist with a week and a half ago on the Naas Road.  People facing repossession and eviction met and told stories about their experiences and the cases they face in court.Having no legal advice or representation puts one in an impossible position.  There is effectively no defence against a claim of the bank or the loan sharks.  It is for these reasons that the group New Beginning has provided some legal advice and representation free of charge.  One has a right to legal defence and it should be provided by the State.  A simple amendment would suffice to achieve this.With regard to the bankruptcy laws, the bankruptcy term should be reduced to five years, particularly in respect of one's principal residence.  I do not refer to people with 20 homes or 200 apartments.  One should never face bankruptcy in respect of one's principal family home.  A constituent of mine who had a small business and remortgaged his home to cover his debts lost his job and was evicted from his home with his young family.  He was then advised to seek the protection of the courts through bankruptcy.  He is 38 years of age and now faces 12 years in which he will not be able to get a job or earn over a certain amount.  He cannot get on with his life.  If the bankruptcy period were reduced to five years, it would be a step forward but bankruptcy legislation should not apply to the principal family home or small businesses.Those who are declared bankrupt face dire circumstances because of the greed of the banks and developers.  Deputy Clare Daly made the point that the banks and developers got away with murder.  They are walking away from the problem and are putting money into their wives' accounts while people with young children are losing their family homes and being declared bankrupt in the courts.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	476	When the role of special needs assistant, SNA, was introduced it was very specific and based on the care needs of children with special needs.  It was not an educational role.  In 1998, only 300 SNAs were employed in the system largely working with children with special needs requiring education and support in a segregated environment such as special schools.We began to see parent power in the early part of the new millennium.  Parents saw a growing economy and could no longer be passive about the absence of appropriate education for their child or children.  We began to see court activity.  This forced a new approach to children with special educational needs but it was largely driven by parents and not by politicians.  The genie is out of the bottle and it will not be possible to return it.  Parents may accept hardship for themselves but they certainly will not take what they perceived to be hardship for their child, particularly if that child has a special need.Over the years, the role of SNAs has changed considerably.  It is only now, when money is extremely tight, that the changing role is being questioned.  It would be fair to say the system was broken long before the economic crash arrived.  There has been a clear need to recognise that in practice, the role of the SNA has evolved from having a function to incorporate care needs to having an educational remit.  Whether we like it or not, this is how it has evolved.Not every case will require an SNA to be redesignated and I believe they need to be redesignated.  However, it is clear that if we are to change the system their role must reflect what a large number of them do in the classroom.  Often, SNAs have embarked on education and accreditation.  They want to provide the best available support for the child or children for whom they care and sometimes they do so at their own expense.Over the past 10 or 12 years, our classrooms have changed fundamentally.  In addition to children with special educational needs, it is not unusual to have children whose first language is not English.  Class sizes have also grown in recent years.  When I was canvassing during the general election campaign I met young teachers and one would be proud to have them stand in front of a classroom.  Their only complaint was not about their situation or their pay and conditions but that they were not getting an opportunity to speak or look after children because the demands in the classroom were so high.  They deal with classrooms with pupils of a varying range of abilities.  Given that we have such mixed classes, class sizes have become an even more important issue. In areas of the country, such as mine, where the population has expanded rapidly in recent years, the number of children tends to be greater.  It is not unusual in parts of my constituency to have classes of in excess of 30 children, sometimes well in excess of this number.What is happening is that we are trying to offer an inclusive system on the cheap.  However, something has to give and the problem is that it will be the quality of education to all the children in the classroom that will suffer.  The recent census of population showed 100,000 people more than were planned for and I must question whether we ever planned.  In my constituency and elsewhere, I have seen new schools having to be approved at the 11th hour to cater for children, of an age at which they were entitled to an education, who could not be accommodated in the local schools or anywhere in a reasonable distance.  I have also seen situations whereby children went through primary education in special classes in mainstream schools but no provision was made for them at second level.  Many such families ended up returning to the courts because we did not plan.  Again, it was the parents who drove this.When I was last a Member of the Dáil I asked a series of parliamentary questions on how much had been spent in the preceding three years, from 2004 to 2006, fighting in court parents seeking appropriate education for their children.  When I totted up the numbers, the total spent was €20 million.  I do not want to see a return to the courts but I can see situations in which parents will feel they have no choice.As the population grows, the need for educational supports will grow.  I doubt 10,000 is the right number but it may be.  It needs to be based on need rather than economics because long-term economics will suffer by virtue of the fact that the education being provided will suffer.  Most children with special needs are educated in mainstream schools.  Special schools are for more dependent children.  A few months ago, the number of SNAs in St. Raphael's in Celbridge was reduced.  One parent was asked not to send a child to school because that child could not be accommodated safely in the environment.  That is a disgrace.  Certain things must be safeguarded and this situation simply cannot be allowed to continue.The voices of parents, teachers, SNAs and other resource providers, together with experts, must all play a part in designing the service.  The National Council for Special Education is on the frontline but it works on the basis of available resources rather than meeting needs.  Sometimes one hears the offensive remarks about special education needs officers, SENOs, but it is not their fault; they can work only with what is available to them.There is also a lack of transparency in the system.  Typically, parents complain it took them months or years to get an SNA and 15 minutes for the service to be withdrawn.  That was about economics and not education.  There is a need for an independent appeals mechanism as opposed to the situation at present whereby the National Council for Special Education refuses a case and then adjudicates an appeal.  It lacks credibility.A reformed system needs a method of accreditation that would allow a portion of SNAs working in the system to train and qualify as learning support assistants.  This would be a reflection of the work they do at present.  The rewards for many SNAs go far beyond the issue of a weekly wage.  I remind the House they are not excessively paid and often the difference between what they are paid and what they would receive on the dole is not huge.  The tangible results they get are from the job they do, and many of them will state this.  Sometimes the result is achieved slowly, but a result is achieved.  They also see that the culture for children with special needs has changed and they have been part of this change.  This benefit cannot be quantified in the short term but it is light-years ahead of my experience growing up when children with special needs were very much segregated.  We cannot see a return to this.I have never entered the house of a child with special needs where the parents have not had a folder, because they have become permanent lobbyists for their child.  For many years, parents of a child with Down's syndrome presumed a child with autism received better services.  However, such parents now speak to each other and they know service provision is similar across the spectrum and that it will never be adequate.  There needs to be a base line beyond which we do not go.  These services must be protected.  Parents speak to each other and are active together and in that regard it does not matter what diagnosis the child has.  Parents may be prepared to accept hardship but they will not accept it for their children.  The Government has picked a fight with the wrong group.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I will start by referring to views expressed by the Labour Party when it was in opposition.  According to the Labour Party, it believes "in the equal right of every person to realise their full potential" and regards investment in education as "the most important investment we can make in our own future".  It is, it continues, "central to our longer term economic recovery — not something that can wait for that recovery to happen".  The party is also "committed to protecting children's education from the kinds of austerity supported by other parties".  It is small wonder the Labour Party is getting along so well with the Fine Gael Party when it has adopted the same measures as Fine Gael and taken a common approach, one in which it says one thing in opposition and does exactly the opposite in power.I found it nauseating last week to observe the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, with children perched around him reading books, talk about improving numeracy and literacy when children with additional needs are being left to flounder as a result of the Government's failure to reverse the cuts introduced by its predecessor and its decision to add a few more cuts of its own.  That it delayed the announcement of these measures until the last minute in the hope that it would derail justifiable opposition from parents and teachers is a mistake it makes at its peril.  Many of the Government's statements on education are characterised by disingenuous double-speak.  While the Minister is correct to highlight the need to improve literacy — in that regard, I welcome the reduction in the number of subjects on the curriculum — the Minister's statement on numeracy and literacy is directly contradicted by his decision to stand over cuts in resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.The manner in which literacy is taught in the classroom is the problem.  One example of the special and particular role special needs assistants have in the classroom is that they allow a division of labour which enables the teacher to concentrate on children who have a problem.  Irrefutable evidence is available to show that the role played by special needs assistants has turned around the position in many inner city schools and improved the opportunities available to many of them.  The report into special needs commissioned by the Government correctly highlighted that the role of special needs assistants has changed from the role originally envisaged for them, which was to provide support for a specific child with special needs.  The role they play is similar in some respects to the role played by teaching assistants in the English education system.  It is a vital role which must be recognised and for which there is a place because it benefits all children with special needs, as well as their classmates and society as a whole.It is a crime and disgrace that unofficial practice in recent times has been to approve SNA posts only in circumstances where a child is deemed to be a danger to himself or others.  Many children with autism are deemed to be insufficiently disruptive to require extra assistance.  This means that by the time they negotiate the next layer of their education, for instance, entry to second level education, they lack the necessary social skills to deal with the transition.  Every case is different and for this reason special needs assistants and resource teachers enhance the situation for everybody.The Government has done the opposite of what it promised to do when in opposition.  The measures it has proposed will cause great harm.  It is creating an illusion because it will, on the one hand, save resources in education while, on the other, add costs to the social welfare budget as special needs assistants lose their jobs.  It will not get away with the choice it has made.  It is an indictment of the State that it spends €350,000 to keep one child in Oberstown remand centre but cannot deliver sufficient resources to allow children to develop to their full potential.The Socialist Party calls for the reversal of the cap and cuts, including to resource teaching hours.  We will stand full square with parents tomorrow and in September until the Government listens and does what it said it would do before it got into power.

I thank and commend my colleagues in the Technical Group for showing great courage and leadership on this matter.  I call on parents and teachers to come to Leinster House at 3 p.m. on Wednesday to show support for the campaign by the Technical Group to fight for services for all children with disabilities.I challenge those in Government who actively support cuts to educational services for children with a disability.  They are penalising children for the actions of bankers and some developers and politicians.  Six months ago, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin travelled around Dublin North Central ranting about cuts to educational services which had been introduced by the previous Government.  Having used the issue to secure his election, it is a disgrace that he is actively supporting further cuts in education, specifically in the number of special needs assistants.  His silence is deafening.

We all knew what the financial position was before the election.  Deputy Ó Ríordáin had led our constituents up the garden path on education by actively supporting cuts.  Such hypocrisy and false politics should always be challenged in the Chamber.This debate presents Deputies with a choice.  Either they are on the side of pupils with special needs or they are not on their side.  Deputy Ó Ríordáin and his party have chosen the latter option.  Others have made the same choice.  In moving a motion in this House on 12 February 2008, the current Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, who was then an Opposition Deputy, called for, among other things, additional funding for the provision of special needs education, including the provision of specialised education for children with autism, the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and a revision of the appeals process available to parents.  He also criticised the extent to which parents were being forced to pursue education services for their children through the courts.  Speaking in support of the motion, the current Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who was then also an Opposition Deputy, stated that the Labour Party supported the motion unreservedly and asked the Minister to "recognise the validity of one-to-one teaching for some children".  Referring to the Labour Party, he stated that the existing provisions were "the minimum that we would look for".  Concluding the debate, Deputy Hayes called for political leadership on the issue, stating that people needed to be given hope and, above all, choice.  Tonight, I call for political leadership and support for children with special needs and their parents.The Government's measures will affect every child attending a primary school, not only those with special needs.  They will have a major impact on the most vulnerable children in society who should not have to bear the brunt of financial mistakes they had no hand, act or part in making.  Their effects will be felt by such children for the rest of their lives.  As has been well documented, every €1 spent on children, especially children with learning difficulties and special educational needs, saves €7 in future costs.  Many top class educationalists have researched this area.Groups such as Inclusion Ireland, which campaigns for people with disability, strongly condemned the decision to cut back teaching hours and supports for children with disabilities.  The Department of Education and Skills announced that from September onwards, schools will only be given 90% of the teaching hours they will need to meet the independently assessed needs of pupils with disabilities.  This is another cutback in educational support for children with disabilities.  These cuts are compounded by increasing class sizes which place children with a disability at further disadvantage.  Inclusion Ireland continues to have major concerns about the lack of an independent appeals system in the area of special needs education.I urge Deputies to support the motion by stepping up to the mark at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow night by supporting children with special needs and their families and attending tomorrow's protest.

If this is their way of doing that I find it difficult to understand.Resource teachers for Travellers have been cut.  This hits every child in the primary schools that are affected but it hits most Traveller children and children with weaker learning ability.  Cuts to learning support teachers and to language support teachers are hitting those who most need our help.  The first priority of a State is to look after those who most need its help.  Some of us do all right at looking after ourselves because, for one reason or another, we have had advantages in life and have financial independence, but many people in our society need the help of the Government to fulfil their potential and grow in a healthy manner.We are damaging young children and we are damaging children from the less well-off sections of our community the most.  If we were in a Third World country we would value education as being vital to the improvement of where we are.  Third World people see education as a way out of their difficult situation.  We are considered a First World country but we do not have as healthy an approach to education as even Third World countries do.We give money to so many areas but we are prepared to damage our children.  We all know that a euro spent on a child before the age of ten will save the state €7 or €8 before the child becomes an adult.  How false is that economy?  We will save €4.5 million by charging children for coming to school on buses.  Which children will suffer from this measure?  Will it be the children of people who earn more than €100,000 per year?  It will not.  The children of people on the dole or in low-paid employment will be hit.The Government says there will be enough help for those affected by the cap on funding for special needs assistants.  The Taoiseach told the House there would be access for all children who need special needs support and that no child would lose all the support he or she needed.  The words "access" and "all" are vital here.  Children with special needs will have some access but will it be enough?  They will probably not lose all their support but will they lose 50% of it?  If a child requires 100% of a special needs assistant's attention there is no point in asking that assistant to look after three children at the same time. It will not work.  All three children will be left floundering.The Special Needs Parents Association has had huge problems with how the Government is handling this situation.  It is angry at the continued lack of an independent appeals process for special educational needs organisers.  Parental involvement in the decision-making process has been poor.  Parents have no say in this process.  When a child has been assessed there is no obligation on the assessor to report to the parent.The association's response to the report of the joint committee was interesting.  It includes the following:The allocation of SNA hours should follow clearly stated assessment tools that will allow decisions on the educational needs and care needs of each child to be expressed in terms of actual hours of SNA support needed per day or per week. The Special Needs Parents Association submits that if you are a child with special educational needs and if your capacity to participate in and benefit from education is restricted due to an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or learning disability you need to have a psychological assessment from a recognised psychologist or medical specialist in order to access the required supports.Referring to the cap on the number of psychologists in the national educational psychological service introduced by the previous Government, the association comments, "If a child cannot get an assessment of needs there would be no requirement on the State to provide the service".  The parents of Ireland will not accept this treatment when their children's education and well-being is at stake.

I hope the Government will pay heed to what is being said this evening.Only a very short time ago Deputy Brian Hayes, who is now a Minister of State, placed a motion before the House condemning all and sundry on this issue.  I was on the other side of the House at the time.  Deputy Hayes was vocally supported by all Opposition Deputies, including the Minister of State who is present this evening, Deputy Sean Sherlock.I mean no personal disrespect to Deputy Sherlock when I say I cannot believe the turn-around and the sheer audacity of the U-turns performed by the Government, especially with regard to children with special needs.  We heard today of a similar U-turn on the hospital service in Roscommon and of the promises that were made.  We all know them.  Senator Phil Prendergast and Deputy Tom Hayes used to attack me on a weekly basis for my support of the Government.  There was attack after attack.  The public, and especially the families and communities of children with special needs, are now totally dismayed.  The Government is undermining the body politic by its blatant actions a mere three months after voting to demand that all kinds of services be retained and that extra services be put in place.The motion moved by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, when he was a member of the Opposition also demanded lighter regulation and ease of access to the psychological service.  However, Deputy Brian Hayes and his colleagues have moved across the floor of the House, changed their clothes and are implementing those very policies that will support the fat cats of society and bankers, the bank robbers who robbed from within.  These bank robbers did not come into the banks with guns.  They robbed from within.  The Government is  protecting speculators and all the people who brought us into the current mess but not the unfortunate families who are doing their best.Reports from the OECD and other bodies have highlighted illiteracy problems in our adult population.  Other speakers have referred to the value of investing in the education of children, and especially of children with special needs, at an early age.  Earlier today, I heard the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs answer parliamentary questions.  I complimented her on her ambition to retain early childhood supports.  It beggars belief, therefore, that the Government, without even frowning, is to vote against this evening's motion.  Deputy Tom Hayes and Senator Phil Prendergast made scurrilous attacks on me and simply walked away.  Senator Prendergast has gone to Europe and Deputy Hayes is here in the Dáil voting to cut essential services.The motion of last February called for political leadership.  I call on the Deputies who supported it, and who now support the Government, to find their consciences, their backbones and their decency and not deprive those children about whom they were so concerned at that time.  Or were they merely concerned about getting the highest vote possible and the highest number of seats?  Is this what politics has become?  If so, it is very unfortunate.  I also sat on committees with the Minister of State and I accepted his passion and commitment for the underprivileged but I do not know how he and his party can accept this.  Parents cannot get assessments for their children unless they have the wherewithal to pay for them.  Following approval, it could take a year or two before an SNA post is sanctioned.  They have to fight and continuously lobby for the post.  With the stroke of a pen in some office, the SNA can be removed and that can have serious implications for the other students in the classroom.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The conduct of the Government parties this evening is absolutely despicable.  They have 113 Deputies in the House and only two of them are present.  That is no reflection on the Minister of State or Deputy Harris but no other Member is on the Fine Gael or Labour Party benches.  Does that reflect the interest the Government has in special needs for the most vulnerable children in our society or are they hiding because they travelled around the country last January and February promising at every door where this issue was brought up that there would be no cuts to this service or to the number of SNAs, that the same number of resource teachers would be maintained and, if at all possible, they would extend the system of supports for children with special needs to preschools?Like Deputy Mattie McGrath, I heard the promises that Labour Party and Fine Gael politicians gave at the doors in south Tipperary.  At a public meeting of parents and SNAs in Clonmel last night, we were told by many of them that their doors were knocked on by Labour Party canvassers for Phil Prendergast, MEP, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who gave assurances to parents and SNAs that this scheme would be supported and expanded, if possible.  These Members are hiding and it is time they came into the House and explained themselves.  Previous speakers highlighted that not too long ago a motion was tabled by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and supported by the Minister for Education and Skills when they were in opposition.  Deputy Quinn stated:This motion, which the Labour Party unreservedly supports, asks the Minister to recognise the validity of one-to-one teaching for some children... The existing provisions are the absolute minimum that we would look for.Such commitments were given in the House by the current Government parties and on the doors last January and February during the election campaign.The issue of children with special educational needs is important and it is dear to the hearts of their parents.  At last night's public meeting, parents told their stories.  They are fearful of the future and they do not know how their children will get on without the support of SNAs.  They are also fearful that down the road, because their children may not get the necessary support at the right age, they could end up in residential institutions.  That is a significant fear for parents.It is not good enough for the Minister for Education and Skills to throw his hands in the air and say our economic sovereignty is gone.  This is a wealthy country with €250 billion in the hands of the wealthiest 5% of the population.  We do not have a wealth tax but I believe it is time for the Minister for Finance to introduce such a tax.  Many European countries and states in America have a wealth tax.  A former Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, introduced a wealth tax in the 1970s when there was little or no money around.  The wealthiest in our society have €250 billion in assets, excluding property, according to the most recent CSO statistics.  The amount increased by €27.3 billion in 2009 and it is estimated by the CSO to have increased by the same amount in 2010.  They have personal assets, excluding property, of €136 billion and they do not pay a single red cent.Is it not time that these people were patriotic?  Is it not time the Minister for Finance and the Government made them pay their fair share of taxation and put that money towards supporting SNAs and the most vulnerable children in society?  He needs to do that urgently and he needs to fulfil the promise the Government parties made at every door not just in regard to SNAs but in regard to protecting the vulnerable.  Cutting the number of SNAs and resource teachers will not protect the most vulnerable children in this society.  As previous speakers said, the cost of these cuts will become known at a later date when these children are older and they have to avail of residential institutions.The point of the support system for children with special needs is to ensure that when they leave school they can fulfil themselves as much as possible — in the same way we all live our lives — by living at home in their own communities, ensuring they do not have to avail of residential units.  Their parents should not have to be fearful that they will end up in these units or about what will happen their children when they pass away.  That is an important worry for parents.  It is time that these cuts were reversed.  If they are implemented, there will be almost no SNAs available for children with special needs in junior infant classes.  The suggestion is that only children who engage in dangerous behaviour will be supported in junior infants.  That is particularly irresponsible because the sooner children who have difficulties are supported, the better the outcome and the more support parents will have.Parents are also seriously worried about the cutbacks affecting the national educational psychological service.  Children must wait for assessments for more than 12 months.  In some cases charitable organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have to support parents in getting psychological assessments because of the significant delays involved.  I appeal to the Minister tonight to do what he said he would do in opposition, to do what his party said it would do at every door throughout the country in the course of the recent general election, and support children, reverse the cuts and ensure that a proper system is introduced in accordance with the motion tabled by the Technical Group.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14097	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I move amendment No. 2:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"commends the Government for continuing to prioritise the allocation of resources to support the education of pupils with special educational needs;notes that the Government is continuing to fill special needs assistant posts and resource and learning support teacher posts at a time when a moratorium on filling posts applies in the wider public sector;notes the level of expenditure on additional dedicated resources for special education of some €1.3 billion which is almost 15% of total education expenditure;notes that provision has been made for the coming school year for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) which is more than were in place in 2010 and in preceding years;notes that the number of resource teachers for special needs children in mainstream schools is at an all time high of 9,950;notes that the cap on Special Needs Assistants was introduced by the previous Government when Ireland entered the Programme of Financial Support with the EU and IMF;notes the recent review of the special needs assistant scheme and in particular the findings that the scheme has assisted as many students as possible to be included in mainstream schools, that it is contrary to best practice for SNAs to adopt a pedagogical role and that there is a need to clarify the ‘care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals alike;notes that school transport for children with special educational needs continues to be prioritised and that no charges have been introduced for these pupils; andrecognises that special education will continue to be a priority for the Government and that the considerable provision of resources for special education must be deployed in the most equitable and effective manner possible."The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has asked me to apologise for his absence from tonight's debate.  He is in Chicago as part of efforts to increase international student numbers in Ireland, in line with commitments made in the programme for Government.  In the education area, he will address the National Association of Fellowship Advisors, attend a function aimed at promoting the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme, promote links with Irish-educated alumni, and promote Ireland to a group of high schools.  He will also hold meetings with the Chicago Board of Education and engage in a number of wider activities for the Irish community in Chicago and the American Ireland Fund.This evening's debate provides an opportunity to clarify some of the confusion evident in some of the public comment on the provision of supports for children with special educational needs.  It also provides me with an opportunity to reassure all parents of children with special educational needs that their children will continue to have access to an education appropriate to their needs.It is important to note that 15% of the entire budget of the Department of Education and Skills — €1.3 billion — will be spent in support of children with special educational needs this year.  The provision is in line with expenditure in 2010 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.The Government is committed to the protection of front line services for pupils with special educational needs.  This year we will fund approximately 9,950 resource and learning support teachers in schools.  That represents an increase of 350 over last year.  Additionally, we have protected staffing levels in special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools.  More than 1,000 teachers are in place in special schools.  The average pupil-teacher ratio in special schools nationally is 5.6:1.  Also, 500 special classes will be in place in mainstream primary and post primary schools.All sides of the House will recognise that it is necessary to ensure that educational services are delivered within the limits of the resources available.  Within these limits however the Government will prioritise and support special educational services.  The Government will not however re-visit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14097	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	504	In all, there are more than 20,000 adults, including SNAs and resource-learning support teachers in schools to support children with special educational needs.  Each year my Department makes detailed plans, taking account of population growth, for future allocations of resources across all areas of education, including special education.  In this context, Deputies may wish to know that the pupil population to SNA ratio has reduced from 252:1 in 2001 to 78:1 in 2010.  By any standard the development and growth of the special needs assistant programme has been remarkable.  I wish to stress that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources it is considered that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school.Deputies will be aware of the recent value for money and policy review of the SNA scheme.  The review has found that the scheme is supporting schools in meeting the needs of eligible students, and that it has assisted as many students as possible to be included in mainstream schools.  However, the review also points to a possible over-allocation of SNAs in schools of which 10% are in special schools and up to 27% in mainstream schools.The decision to introduce a cap on overall SNA numbers means that all SNA posts will now be subject to annual review and there will be ongoing monitoring of overall SNA numbers throughout the year, in accordance with the recommendations of the review.  That will facilitate the allocation of SNA support in the most fair and equitable way.  I note Deputy Clare Daly's points in that regard, but if one is to have teaching assistants then one will have to have a teaching assistant scheme.  It is either an SNA scheme or it is a teaching assistant scheme.  The case she made was a genuine one.The review has also concluded that the SNA scheme has moved away from the objectives of the scheme originally envisaged, which was to provide for children's care needs in an educational setting, and has moved towards SNA involvement in behavioural, therapeutic, pedagogical and administrative duties.  The review concludes that this may stem from a lack of understanding of the role of the SNA which has led to inefficiencies in the system.  Schools and parents have come to expect the allocation of SNA posts for students whose care needs do not meet the terms of the scheme.  I wish to be clear in explaining to the House that there are no plans for the expansion of the SNA scheme beyond the provision of supports to schools to enable them support the care needs of pupils with disabilities.The value for money and policy review is clear in that respect when it states the crucial importance of communicating the purpose of the SNA scheme in order to ensure that the care role envisaged for the SNA is understood by schools, professionals and parents, and that SNAs are not used to supplement teaching or as therapeutic support for students.  The NCSE allocates separate additional teaching expertise to provide the additional teaching support needs for these children.I wish to be clear on some key issues regarding the SNA scheme: SNAs are being allocated on the basis of priority criteria and in a consistent manner.  The NCSE will use its professional judgment in that regard.  Some of the priority criteria which apply are: ensuring that the minimum SNA to special class ratio is maintained in both special schools and special classes; ensuring that schools which have enrolled children with the most significant special care needs are supported to meet those needs; ensuring the provision of support for children with incontinence issues; and ensuring that the full-day cover provision is not reduced below a full day.To ensure that the allocation of SNAs for the 2011 to 2012 school year is managed in a prudent and responsible manner, the NCSE, in consultation with the Department, has decided to retain approximately 475 of the 10,575 SNA posts in order that they are available to be allocated over the remainder of the school year.  That will ensure the NCSE retains the capacity to meet urgent cases as they arise over the school year while also ensuring that the overall number of SNA posts allocated will remain within the capped number of 10,575.  The reserve posts will be prioritised to address appeals and emergency cases, acquired injuries and new assessments during the school year, new entrants to schools, and reconsideration of allocation levels for schools in which interventions have been unsuccessful.A process will be in place in the new school year to review allocation decisions to ensure correct procedures were followed and that they comply with the Department's policy.  I understand the NCSE will communicate this to schools early in the new school year.  Schools, for their part, must demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.In 2010 the Department provided 9,600 posts for learning support and resource teaching.  It is intended to provide 9,950 learning support and resource teaching posts in the 2011-2012 school year, an increase of 350.  This is an historically high level of provision.  It has been calculated that, based on the number of applications received to date for resource teaching support by the National Council for Special Education, an allocation of 90% of the identified resource teaching allocations can be made to schools in the first instance.  This will provide schools with the majority of their allocation while preserving enough capacity to ensure the Department can provide for late or emergency applications while remaining within ECF obligations.I wish to clarify for the House that 4,538 posts available in mainstream primary schools under the general allocation model of additional teaching support are not affected by the 90% measure.  The effect of a 90% allocation of resource teaching support means a reduction of six minutes per hour of resource teaching allocated.  Schools can make up additional time through grouping of children, doubling of children and more effective management of teaching time.  When the full level of demand is known, the initial 90% allocation may be revisited.As Deputies are aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the NCSE and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  The Department has established a cross-departmental working group, including relevant agency personnel, to consider each non-commenced part of the Act.  The group will focus on preparing a plan for the implementation of the Act.The Government continues to ensure all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments.  We have committed to reversing the cap placed on the number of psychologists employed by the National Educational Psychological Service.  The issue of recruiting more psychologists will be kept under review in the context of the overall employment control framework in the public sector.There are no changes proposed to the provision of school transport services, including escorts, for eligible children with special educational needs.  At present, my Department also provides a direct grant to 500 parents to support their school transport costs.  The grant has been reviewed and from the start of the coming school year it will be based on Civil Service mileage rates.In the face of economic turmoil, the Government has prioritised the provision of supports for pupils with special educational needs.  As well as teachers and special needs assistants, we will continue to provide assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  We will protect front-line education services as much as possible within the resources we have to work with.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country.  All areas of Government will have to manage on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.  I commend the Government's amendment to the House.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I genuinely thank the Technical Group for dedicating their Private Members' time to the important issue of special needs education.  While the issues we discuss in this House every day are important, this motion is of real and genuine significance to me, as I became involved in politics through the issue of special needs.  When a relative of mine was diagnosed with special educational needs, I became frustrated, like so many family members throughout the country, with the lack of services and supports available despite the great wealth in our country at the time.  I established an autism charity to endeavour to highlight these issues and to support families living with autism.One of the biggest failings of our country during the Celtic tiger era was the way in which families and children with special needs were still overlooked in so many areas.  Parents of children with special needs, who already had their hands full trying to care for their children, found themselves obliged to go cap in hand to the State for the supports their children needed, despite the amount of money that was being wasted on electronic voting machines, Bertie Bowls and all the rest.  I will not be engaging in party political remarks on this matter.  There is a time and a place for that, but this issue is far too important to me.  I am only sorry that this country finds itself in such an economic position that all my political desires, aims and objectives for special needs education cannot be implemented as quickly as I would desire.  Crucially, however, that does not take away from the responsibility of the Government to outline its vision for special needs education and to work tirelessly to ensure children with special educational needs are supported.Considering the climate in which this debate takes place, the Government amendment before the House is progressive, constructive and factual.  It sends a message to parents of children with special needs that we will continue to prioritise the needs of their children, and outlines how the Government is fulfilling its commitment to prioritise this area in a number of ways, some of which the Minister of State alluded to: by providing an exemption from the moratorium on recruitment in the public sector for SNA posts and resource teaching posts; by ensuring that the number of resource teachers for children with special needs in mainstream schools will be at its highest level in the history of the State, with 315 more posts in our schools this September; by guaranteeing that there will be more SNA posts in our schools this coming school year than in 2010 or, indeed, any other year; and, crucially, by reforming the way in which posts are allocated by holding back a reserve of both SNA posts and resource teaching posts until September in order that children whose needs become apparent only in the new school year can avail of such supports.  In this way we can provide parents who are not satisfied with the level of support their children have been afforded a right of appeal.  For far too long, parents who have sought help in September have found that the cupboard is bare.  I welcome the remarks of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in this regard.I want to send out a clear message to the Government and to the Department of Education and Skills that we must do better when it comes to communicating with parents of children with special needs.  All too often over the years, and indeed in recent weeks, parents have been left worried, panicked and stressed as they read media reports and departmental circulars.  For example, the announcement about resource teaching was simply botched.  What should have been a good news story — additional resource teaching posts — was reported in the media as a 10% cut, but that was not the case.  We as politicians, as a Government and as the Oireachtas, along with our colleagues and friends in the media, must ensure information is conveyed to parents factually and quickly.While the Government is bound by the cap on SNAs, we now have an opportunity to outline our plan and vision for special needs education in the future.  Gone must be the days of the State dragging parents of children with special needs through the courts system.  Gone must be the days of mothballing important legislation affecting special educational needs as soon as the country hits rocky waters.  The new Government must produce a realistic timeframe for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act as quickly as possible.  I welcome the comments of the Minister of State in this regard.We must also look to our European colleagues and learn from how they provide for children with special educational needs.  I agree with the comments of Deputy Daly in this regard; the UK model of teaching assistants merits consideration.  In addition, the Minister must address the difficulty of accessing psychological services and obtaining diagnoses.  I welcome the commitment to reverse the cap on National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, assessments.As a Deputy, I will continue to work as hard as I possibly can to support people with special educational needs.  I will work with Deputies on all sides of this House to make progress on this issue.  Nobody, least of all me, finds any cut to special needs education palatable, but from my conversations with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and Skills and many stakeholders, parents included, I am satisfied that in keeping with this legally binding cap, we are doing all that we possibly can to support children with special educational needs.  We can never do enough in this area.  We will always need to do more and we must always strive to do better.

An important principle in a democratic parliament, and one with which I agree, is that the Opposition can raise matters such as the provision of special needs assistants, the minimum wage and joint labour committee agreements.  Like others, I welcome such debates with one proviso — that the truth is told in them.  In my first 130 days as a Member, I have noticed the old cliché, the first causality of war is truth, also applies to private Members' motions.  Tonight not one Member on the other side of the House, some of whom, but not all of them, I have respect for, referred to the facts about educational supports.These are the facts.  This year 10,575 special needs assistants will be available, more than were available in 2010.  At a time when a moratorium on public service recruitment is in place, there is none on resource and learning support teachers.  I commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, for increasing the number of resource teachers allocated this year by 350.None of these facts were alluded to by any Member opposite.  Neither did any Member opposite refer to the fact the economy is knackered.  They believe no one has left the country or that anybody is unemployed, when for instance, my children and my neighbours' children have.  The economy is simply in bits.  I found listening to the Technical Group — which I refer to as the Highly Technical Group because it comprises stockbrokers and developers — stomach churning, particularly when on 30 September 2008 some of that group raced to vote for the blanket bail out of Anglo Irish Bank and others.  Not one of them referred to this fact this evening.  It is a bit like the old adage, "Who Fears to Speak of '98?".

Yet, he got into a sweat to get into this Chamber to vote for the bank bailout on 30 September 2008.  I also recall hearing him recently in the Chamber talking about celebrating the failed US invasion of the Bay of Pigs and saying to myself "this guy must be a socialist or a communist", which is all right with me.  If Deputy Finian McGrath decides to go to Cuba for the summer, however, he should be careful.  If Fidel Castro hears he bailed out the Irish banks while forcing half of the young Irish population to emigrate to Canada and Australia, he would probably take the Deputy aside at Havana airport and kneecap him or shoot him in the head.  Deputy Finian McGrath would certainly not come back from Havana.

Having worked in the primary education sector, I do not need to be told the value of special needs assistants or the difficulties faced by the sector.  There needs to be balance and truth to this debate.  While doing some constituency work in my office this evening, I was agog listening to the contributions from Members opposite, particularly from the Member from south Tipperary who claimed Government backbenchers were few and far between in the Chamber today.  Yet, when the first Government backbencher rose to speak on this motion, the Technical Group evacuated the Chamber.  Obviously, those Members opposite are only prepared to listen to one argument.The previous two speakers introduced the fact that the largest number ever of special needs assistants have been guaranteed their positions for next year and the cap on public service numbers introduced by the former Government does not apply to them.  It is regrettable that amnesia seems to be widespread among Members opposite.  So serious are the cases of several Members in the Technical Group, particularly Deputies Finian McGrath and Mick Wallace, that they should consult their GPs.  Deputy Mick Wallace, himself a builder once, spoke about the economy being in tatters because of the banks and the builders.One can only take so much of this.  The fact remains, our country is bankrupt and its economy destroyed.  We are now subservient to a group of foreigners who are keeping this country open.

#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am glad the issue of appeals, the National Educational Psychological Service and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 was addressed by the Minister of State.  Will he convey to the Minister for Education and Skills the need to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio?  This was allowed go out of control by the former Government.  While I understand the Department is concerned about the financing implications of reducing it, more emphasis should be placed on it during the Government's lifetime.The commitment to the National Educational Psychological Service is a huge breakthrough that gives parents, teachers, schools and all other stakeholders valuable support despite the Government facing the worst of economic tsunamis.  The Government is committing itself, in the form of its amendment to the motion, to putting special educational needs and the children who have such needs and their parents and teachers to the fore.  The position of teachers in respect of this matter is sometimes forgotten.  Some teachers face major problems in their classrooms.I am delighted that last week the Minister for Education and Skills placed two issues, namely, literacy and numeracy, at the top of his agenda.  Under the previous Government, Ireland fell badly down the pecking order in the context of literacy and numeracy.  What happened in recent years proves that there are major problems in the primary education sector.  I am not just referring to the area of special educational needs in this regard.  People must realise that it is not all about money when it comes to this matter; what is at issue is the delivery of a service.I was visited by a group of special needs assistants, SNAs, last week and I will be meeting another such group this week.  I am very honest when I meet such people and I inform them that our country — like Italy, Spain, Greece and other nations — is on the brink of economic collapse.  However, there is a commitment from the Government that 10,575 SNAs will retain their positions.  That is the largest number of SNAs ever in employment in this country.  The position is similar with regard to learning support teachers.The Government has prioritised this matter.  However, we have no money.  Perhaps those who proposed the motion can dig up money from their back yards.  The Government is trying to do a great deal more with much less money.  I commend the amendment tabled by the Minister to the House.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue, which is of great concern to many families throughout the country.  As public representatives we are aware of the concern of many parents in regard to special needs provision.  In the Fianna Fáil amendment to the motion, I have asked that the Government and the Minister prioritise funding for special education within the financial provision for the Department of Education and Skills.  At a time of huge demand on limited resources, we must ensure that said provision is prioritised for children with special needs.  I welcome the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, in that regard.Those of us in public life have for some years worked with many families, parents and schools which were seeking those additional resources that make such a difference to the lives of so many children.  Last month, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, stated that he intends to prioritise and support special educational services.  I support his policy in this regard.The first debate on education and skills in this Dáil was in respect of a Private Members' motion I tabled in the middle of April.  That motion requested Dáil Éireann to support the role of education and training in our economic recovery and referred to the need to maintain an inclusive education system and to support people in achieving their potential through that system.  In the motion in question I also outlined, in clear terms, the fact that we must protect the financial provision relating to education in future budgets.  That motion won the unanimous support of the House.Education is a key economic driver.  Most important, however, its purpose is to assist individuals in reaching their full potential.  In the debate on the Private Members' motion to which I refer, I emphasised the absolute need to build on the progress made in providing much-needed and adequate support for children with special needs at both primary and post-primary level.  When he served as Minister for Education and Science in 1997, Deputy Martin attached particular importance to this area within the framework of the overall education sector.During the past decade there has, quite rightly, been a dramatic improvement in the level and quality of supports for children with special educational needs.  Those improvements were much needed.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, indicated, "By any standard the development and growth of the special needs assistant programme has been remarkable."  There are more than 10,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, working in our schools.  In 1997, that number stood at 250.  There are almost 10,000 learning support resource teacher posts in primary and post-primary schools.  The purpose of these posts is to provide additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs.  The financial allocation for this year provides for an increase of 350 posts on last year's allocation.  For the benefit of Deputy O'Donovan, who has left the Chamber, specific provision in this regard was made in the final budget introduced by the previous Government last December.We all realise that despite the increase in numbers, more must be done.  That is what we all want to work to achieve.  I am of the view that the creation of the National Educational Psychological Service, the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the appointment of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, has provided an essential framework for the delivery of supports for children with special needs.  We are aware of the moratorium on recruitment in the public service.  However, specific provision was made in the national recovery plan introduced last November to ensure that the numbers of those employed in this extremely important area would be protected.The need for and the provision of additional resources for the special needs assistant scheme is clearly evident when one considers that the financial allocation in the period 2001 to 2009 rose by 922%.  Those resources have been put to good use in the context of improving the opportunities available to and meeting the hopes of so many families and individual children.  I am sure all Members are aware of children who have been the beneficiaries of this important and much-needed investment.  Sadly, there are children who need such assistance but who unfortunately have not been beneficiaries.  Understandably, the lack of such support is the source of serious disappointment to many hard-pressed parents and will deprive the children to whom I refer of the opportunity to progress in education.The creation of the National Educational Psychological Service, the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the appointment of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, has provided an important and essential framework for the special education system.  There is concern in some areas regarding the possible lack of consistency in applying the criteria for the allocation of SNA support.  That is the perception among some education stakeholders and certain parents, Members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives.When making contributions in this House, we are all naturally influenced by the working of the systems in the areas in which we live and in our constituencies.  I am aware that the appointment of an SENO in my area some time ago proved extremely successful.  My recollection is that prior to such appointments parents or schools made detailed submissions to the Department.  In many instances, they wrote numerous letters and were left waiting for replies.  Final replies were often delayed as a result of some relatively small detail not being provided with an initial application.  I acknowledge that officials were under pressure in the context of their workloads at different times.  My memory is that the interaction seemed to take place by post only.From my own experience of making representations, I am of the view that the appointment of SENOs has provided greater clarity because parents and schools know that there are specific individuals who may be contacted.  In many instances, a few telephone calls can progress an application or provide clarity to applicants in respect of the scope and criteria which obtain in particular schemes.  In the past, delays in processing applications frustrated everyone involved.  It seemed to me that the processing of applications was a desk-only exercise.  That was not adequate.  Personal contact is necessary in sensitive cases of this nature.I do not believe that the particular role of special needs assistants has been adequately understood.  That lack of clarity has not been helpful to parents or schools.  A large cohort of staff has been working in schools in recent years.  This is a relatively new staffing complement and includes the many individuals who work as SNAs, resource teachers and language support teachers.  It was correct for the previous Minister to initiate the value for money and policy review of the SNA scheme.  It is essential to ensure that the resources and the special support available under this scheme reach the intended beneficiaries.According to the review to which I refer, one of the criticisms of the SNA scheme is that its purpose is not well understood by either schools or parents and that this has led to some problems regarding the allocation of SNAs.  It has also led to the role of SNAs being expanded beyond that which was originally intended.  The review found that in the schools surveyed there was an over-allocation of SNAs of 27% at primary and post-primary level and of 10% in special needs schools.  I hope the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education will engage in a detailed debate on this review and will examine the figures to which I refer and the overall policy approach being taken.It is absolutely wrong that there is over-provision in some schools while other schools, and the children who attend them, do not receive the support they both need and deserve.  Surely there is a responsibility on all involved, be they in the Department, in the National Council for Special Education or in schools, to ensure that over-provision does not occur.  The result of such over-provision means there is under-provision elsewhere and that certain children are being denied much-needed support and intervention.  I do not know if the Department has established a working group to deal with the recommendations contained in the value for money and policy review.  However, if the figures to which I referred earlier are accurate, then this is an issue which should be addressed without delay.There has been an annual increase in the number of SNAs in our schools since 1997.  In light of the provision made by the previous Government, the highest number of SNAs ever will be in employment in our schools this year.  It would be prudent to review the operation, efficiency and value of the scheme, not on the basis of cutting costs but to ensure that the needs of children are being adequately and appropriately addressed.  Any particular scheme of supports, particularly one which, by and large, is relatively new to many schools, can be improved.  There should be widespread consultation in respect of any review to be undertaken by a departmental working group.  The membership of that working group should include all stakeholders.The expertise, knowledge, experience and commitment of so many stakeholders, be they parents, teachers, SNAs or those who have benefited from the supports to which I refer, should be availed of as part of any review.  Such a review should be comprehensive but should also be finalised in a short timeframe.  Any review should consider the role of the SNA.  That role has evolved over recent years and there has been huge progress over the past 12 to 14 years.  This was an area to which no resources had been committed previously.  All of us know of cases needing attention through our work.  As a party spokesperson, I have had calls from schools from different parts of the country concerned about their allocation for the coming year.  Our amendment calls for the prioritisation of funding for the special education sector in the financial provision for the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, have referred to the huge progress that has been made, but we need to make further progress.  Much has been achieved, but we have more to achieve to ensure that all children who need special support and their families are given that support in a timely, adequate and appropriate manner.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time with me.  This is the second time in the past few weeks that I have got up to speak about the needs of children with special needs, particularly with regard to County Wexford.  I note the Minister is not present, but I am happy to see the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, here as, having listened to him over a number of years while he was on this side of the House, I know he is caring and concerned about the less well off in society and am sure he will have the interests of those with special needs at heart.The Minister of State has said that the Government will not revisit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of SNAs.  Perhaps it should not do that, but it should revisit the decisions made by some of the SENOs around the country.  Some of the decisions they have made in recent weeks are not in the best interests of children attending our schools.  Deputy Smith and Deputies on the far side of the House have alluded to the fact that there is no consistency in how children are being assessed for special needs assistance.  Recently, I was made aware of a case where a SENO decided that a child who required a zimmer frame was not entitled to a special needs assistant.  This caused great concern for the parents and I am sure similar situations are occurring throughout the country.I have often referred to St. Senan's primary school in Enniscorthy, which is set to lose six SNAs this year.  This school has 600 children, over 50 of whom have various disabilities.  The principal excludes no-one from the school.  The school is very inclusive and also contains an autism centre which previous Ministers consider the gold-plated autism centre of this country.  I am sure the current Minister, Deputy Quinn, would do the same.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills always hold up the autism section of St. Senan's school as an example of the way forward for dealing with children with autism.  Unfortunately, in recent weeks the school has received word that it will lose six SNAs.  Deputy Wallace and I raised this matter in the Dáil previously and, in fairness, the Minister and the Department have sent the senior SENO to revisit and re-examine some of the decisions taken.  Hopefully, the school will get back some of the SNAs.  I do not intend to engage in Minister bashing.  However, I feel strongly that the decision to withdraw SNAs from children entitled to them should be revisited.  Hopefully, such a caring Minister of State as Deputy Sherlock will ensure this happens within the Department.I am the parent of a child with a disability.  When she attended Enniscorthy vocational school 13 years ago, there was only one special needs assistant for the four children in wheelchairs at that time.  We have come a long way from that and now have 10,500 SNAs in the country.  That is only right.  It is important that young people with disabilities are given an opportunity to attend mainstream education.  This is what it is all about, particularly in St. Senan's where Mr. Goff and the teachers try to ensure the children move on to mainstream education as quickly as possible.  This must continue.While it is right to point out that money is scarce, the Minister of State pointed out that the overall expenditure of the Department is €1.3 billion, a significant amount of money.  It is important to prioritise and look after the vulnerable and less well-off in society.  I have received numerous letters in the past few weeks from parents of children in different schools in Wexford and I am sure other Deputies have received similar letters from parents in other parts of the country.  I would like to quote from one particular letter.  It states:I implore you [and your fellow TDs from Wexford] to please stand up for those of us who have not the energy for this fight.  I fight my sons into their clothes every morning, from their socks to their coats, and I fight to keep from becoming bitter.  That is very difficult when you are up EVERY morning at 4.30 a.m. with both boys.  My brightest ray of hope after my sons' smiles has been St. Senans school where they have been respected and provided with a completely appropriate education both academically and socially.  I once thought such enlightened places only existed in the USA.  Don't let these cuts bring us back to the dark days of the past.This parent went on to say that her children were being assessed within the school to see whether they could continue to have an SNA.  This letter sums up the plight of parents of children with special needs in schools around the country who are concerned about losing SNAs.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that such children do not lose their SNAs.This debate is good in that it discusses broadly based education and, in particular, the needs of people with disabilities.  As Deputy Smith said, it is important that we continue to fund schools that provide excellent services for people with disabilities.  I am sure the Minister of State will bring the message to the Minister that he must prioritise children with disabilities in our schools.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	534	There has been a lot of discussion here previously on this issue.  This debate is a welcome opportunity for us to address the issue again and I commend the Technical Group on raising it.  I agree with Deputy Harris with regard to how this has been communicated and accept there have been mistakes made along the route on the issue.  As an elected representative who has been dealing with the area of education, I have tried to concentrate on this issue and to draw out the information with regard to special needs assistants and the difficulties faced by parents.  I do not know about other Deputies, but most of the parents who have come to me are worried sick by the possibility of their child losing their special needs assistant.  They are worried sick because if their children lose that support, there is little left in the line of education available to those children.I have read the value for money policy review in regard to this issue.  Most of the cuts being made seem to be based on that review.  The Minister of State reiterated tonight that the review points out the possible over-allocation of SNAs in schools, to a level of 10% in special schools and 27% in mainstream schools.  The big question I and parents have with regard to this review is where these figures were pulled from.  We would also like to know who drew up the report.  It is reasonable for parents faced with the prospect of their children losing their SNA to look around and suggest there could be another area where cuts could be made within the education system instead.  Most of us on the Opposition side have tried to be helpful in that regard.We accept that the Minister has only one envelope of money; our argument is that the money in that envelope could be better spent.  We went through this argument in regard to the Estimates.  An example I gave during that debate was an article in The Irish Times last week which reported that the head of a college in Waterford spent €100,000 on taxis to and from Dublin.  When asked about these expenses, he contended that the expenditure represented value for money.  All the heads of the various educational institutions are on very high wages, with many receiving hundreds of thousands of euro in expenses.  Yet, at the same time, SNAs earning €14 per hour are being let go.I met with families in my area last week who cannot comprehend how their children have lost their entitlement to special needs assistance.  As other Deputies observed, it comes back to a question of assessment.  In some cases it is apparently taking 15 minutes to assess a child's needs.  I am not an expert and do not know what is involved in such assessments, but the parents of these children are equally in the dark.  I am aware of situations where there is no on-site inspection facility and children's needs are being assessed on the basis of reports.  All of these issues lead to a great deal of confusion and fear.

The introduction of a code of practice and the proposal to review licences where there is irresponsible behaviour on the part of sellers are welcome changes.  I equally welcome proposals to impose some type of code of practice on the advertising of alcohol.  It is sickening that large multinational companies in particular bombard the public with alcohol advertising conveying the message that their product will solve all of life's problems.  There should be restrictions in that area.  I also welcome the proposals to enhance equality legislation.However, I have concerns regarding some aspects of the Bill, particularly the proposal on the provision of legal advice to victims of human trafficking.  This crime is one of the most vile examples of a society that needs to do something about its priorities.  The commodification and enslavement of human beings, particularly vulnerable women, and their sexuality for the purpose of trade is a horror that must be dealt with urgently.  The proposal to extend the provision of legal advice to victims of human trafficking is minimalist and seems only to be included in order to bring us into line with demands from European and international bodies.  It is a case of doing the least possible required.As other Deputies have said, and as organisations dealing with the victims of human trafficking and the sex trade have proposed, we must go further on this issue.  The tiny number of prosecutions in this area clearly shows there is a problem in that the victims of these crimes are not coming forward because of a fear of the consequences.  If we want to give confidence to women in this situation we must show a seriousness about offering them support.  This means, at a minimum, giving them legal representation and not just legal advice, whatever that might involve.  In addition, some of our very draconian immigration legislation is part of the problem.  It is so weighted towards getting people out of the country as quickly as possible without giving them a fair hearing that genuine victims of the horrible phenomenon of sex trafficking will be discouraged and fearful of what is likely to happen to them if they speak up about their plight.  The very least this Bill should do is afford legal representation to people in that situation.I am broadly supportive of the proposed amendments to equality legislation.  However, I am concerned that the proposal that certain types of submissions be dealt with in writing only may have adverse implications for employees.  This amendment is being put forward on the basis of improving efficiency, but there is also reference to reducing expenditure.  My concern is that this is merely a cost-cutting measure which will lessen the opportunity for people who are being treated unfairly by their employer to make their case to the Equality Tribunal.  In other words, it is a way of fast-tracking complaints through the system.  I hope that is not the case, but it looks like it might be.On the bankruptcy issue, there is a need for legislative change in this area, but we also need to distinguish between different categories of people who find themselves bankrupt or insolvent.  As for those whose greed got them into massive financial difficulty as well as the country into massive financial problems, I have no interest in allowing them to walk away from their responsibilities.  However, people who find that they are unable to meet their mortgage repayments or to keep their small businesses going and face bankruptcy as a result — and many ordinary people find themselves in that situation — must be given a break.  The measures must be focused on the circumstances of homeowners and small businesses who find themselves in difficult circumstances in the current economic situation.  The big fish seem to be able always to get away with things.  If anything we should take measures to get some of their wealth from them and their wives.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I am delighted to speak on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  I support many of its provisions, especially Part 3, which deals with the deeds of good samaritans.  It is very important to distinguish between the actions of the good samaritans and facilitate those acts of kindness and bravery.  It can be a grey area.  The provisions of the Bill in this Part are good and positive.I welcome also the provisions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of private security services.  That is badly needed and I welcome the provisions.Reform of the bankruptcy laws is long overdue.  I share some of the views expressed by my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, but I would not agree that every businessman was greedy.  I would say fewer than 100 people, among bankers and developers, were responsible for the greed and speculation, and they certainly need to be dealt with.  We must change the bankruptcy laws to allow for entrepreneurs, people with small businesses, sole traders and landowners who tried to better themselves and better the country while doing so.  We must change the legislation to allow them to survive and live out their lives in happiness, not in fear.  Unlike the majority of European states, our laws do not provide access to an adequate and effective personal insolvency system.  That is the problem.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill that deal with the Irish Property Council as well.  People who had a good relationship with their banks, now, having fallen behind in their repayments, are being harassed and driven to their wits end.  Many are ending up severely depressed and restricted from ever again being an investor.  A good number of such people whom I know in my constituency have taken their own lives.  How much torture can lead to such a sad outcome?I welcome also the provisions dealing with human trafficking.  It is very important that we deal with this issue.  Part 5 deals with intoxicating liquor and these provisions are badly needed.  Anybody who sells intoxicating liquor must be aware of their responsibilities.I totally object to the amendment of the Official Languages Act 2003.  This is a sneaky way of the Government making a provision that this Bill will not be translated into Irish on its enactment because it wants to pass it in a rush.  Our official language is An Ghaeilge.  It is a retrograde step.  Is uafásach an rud é sin a dhéanamh.  I object to this totally.  We have fought hard for our language and succeeded in having it recognised as an official language of the European Union.  Here we are throwing it out, throwing out the baby with the bath water.  We need to be careful.I respect the work that coroners do.  I have no issue with them, but with the ambience and surrounding where the coroners conduct their inquests.  Inquests should be moved from the court setting.  It is sad for people who have lost a loved one in an accident or a sudden death trauma or even worse, if it is a violent death, to go to a courthouse.  We can rent hotels up and down the country to act as courthouses, when the courthouses are unfit for use.  An inquest should not be held in the setting of a court, with a judge and jury.  The inquest must be conducted in a building where compassion is shown for the relatives of the deceased.  It should be conducted in a suitable environment, where people's feelings are considered.  People may be threatened or intimidated by a court setting.  I am not saying they should be, but they are.  I have been there and I understand where the families of the deceased are coming from.I see a reference to the county registrars.  That is timely, but it does not go far enough.  In south Tipperary, the county registrar is a law unto himself.  I tabled six parliamentary questions to find out where the voting machines were stored — the voting machines that were purchased at enormous cost and had to be stored when not in use.  I questioned how the procurement of space to store them was conducted, and where they were stored.  It was a complete and utter sham and I found out they were stored in the property of the county registrar's family, which is outrageous.  This contract was not put out to public tender.  On tabling a third parliamentary question, the machines were moved from Clonmel to Gormanstown in County Meath.  This was an outrageous abuse of public funds.  In response to one question, I was told that it was advertised in a proper manner, but there was no advertisement for storage space.  This type of carry on must be rooted out.  In was also a significant issue in County Waterford, where a property was rented on a long-term lease to house the machines.I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill, but I object totally to the provisions in respect of the Irish language.  Is mór an trua an rud sin.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I welcome the introduction of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the Minister of State in his Department for the work done.  The Bill comprises 15 Parts and this reflects a great deal of hard work and late nights on their part and that of their staff to bring it to the Chamber.  I will not touch on all areas, but will concentrate on a few areas.I welcome the expansion of the Civil Legal Aid Act to enable advice to be given to victims of human trafficking.  I agree with the comments by Deputy Boyd Barrett on the horrors of the whole area of human trafficking.  I am not sure if Deputies have seen the film "Taken" starring Liam Neeson, where his daughter while on a trip to Europe was kidnapped and trafficked.  She was drugged up and subjected to horrors that one would not think about until one sees them graphically portrayed in a film like that.  That shows what could happen in the modern day world.  I have concerns that the word "advice" would be too narrow and hope that "advice" would also include legal representation, which is particularly important for such a vulnerable person, the victim of such an abhorrent crime.  Will the Minister clarify that at some stage in closing?I welcome the reforms of the Bankruptcy Act 1998, which are long overdue.  The automatic discharging of the bankruptcy order after 12 years is welcome as is the new mechanism which can enable the discharge of a bankruptcy order after five years if the courts deem it reasonable and proper to do so.  However, in spite of the welcome reforms, I am concerned that further serious reform is due to help create a new debt settlement system which will help all citizens and not just the wealthy.  As I speak tens of thousands of our citizens are in what can be described as a hopeless situation with unmanageable mortgages on homes that are in deep negative equity.  These citizens will be the first to admit that they freely accepted mortgages which with the benefit of hindsight we now know were unsustainable in the long-term and were the result in many cases of irresponsible lending.  It is obviously in nobody's interests and certainly not in the interests of society as a whole for citizens to remain in these hopeless situations with the negative effects on health, relationships and family life that debt brings.  Reform must be introduced for those who cannot pay debts but not for those who will not pay their debts.  I welcome the direction the Government is taking in its willingness to grasp the nettle and introduce reforms in the area of debt.  As with this Bill, I hope the Bill on reforming our personal debt system will be introduced ahead of time.  Today, Fianna Fáil called for the establishment of a debt enforcement office.  I agree wholeheartedly with it as this will remove the emotive and personal issues of debt problems from the time-consuming and expensive setting of the courtroom.  We do not want to see another quango established and we want to see the finer details of the measure.  Such an office has been advocated by NGOs such as FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centre, and the statutory Law Reform Commission, which published a comprehensive report into debt law reform last year.  It is unfortunate that only now, from the Opposition benches, Fianna Fáil recognises the need for debt reform.  It is ironic that the party's lethargic and arm's length approach towards proper financial regulation and governance led to so many people in Ireland having debt-related problems.I had concerns that the spirit of the Official Languages Act, which is to safeguard and promote the use of Irish in the course of official business, was being downgraded in this Bill.  I received many telephone calls and e-mails from Conradh na Gaeilge, which had concerns this measure would lead to a reduction in the status of the Official Languages Act.  We went to the trouble of having Irish recognised as an official language of the EU through our Irish MEPs.  I sought clarification on the issue.  When the President signs the Bill into law, it becomes an Act.  There is a backlog in the translation of these Acts and the change in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will allow for the publication of the English-language version of the Act online.  The hard copy in both languages will be published in due course.  It is tidying up the situation whereby people do not have hard copies of Acts in court because the Act has not been published due to this anomaly in the Official Languages Act.  I am glad this is clarified by the Bill.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I welcome Deputy Catherine Murphy as the sole Member of the Opposition in the Chamber.  On many occasions, Deputy Wallace remarked on the fact that there were no Deputies from the Government side or from some of the Opposition parties in the Chamber.  I welcome this Bill.  I will speak on the good samaritan section and the changes to the Bankruptcy Act 1988.I compliment Deputy Billy Timmins on initiating this legislation a number of years ago.  His Bill did not get through the Dáil but, thanks to his hard work, we have a measure before us.  Defibrillators are an important part of sporting and recreational facilities around the country.  There is a worry in the sporting fraternity that those who were not trained but who are at the site may not be allowed to use them to aid someone in difficulty.  There are clear instructions on defibrillators.  The Minister might consider this point before tabling amendments.There should also be notification in clubs and recreational facilities about volunteers and what is an act of a good samaritan.  The problem with this Bill and most legislation is that it does not use language we can all understand.  One sentence in the Bill contains 75 words.  I read to the end of the sentence and I had to go back to the start to understand it.  Perhaps the Minister can examine simplifying the wording so that people can understand it.  Notification should be displayed in clubs so that people know what they are eligible to do.I welcome the modification of the Bankruptcy Act with a tinge of regret.  Some 17 people were declared bankrupt in 2009 and 19 up to September 2010 yet, across the Border in Northern Ireland, in excess of 1,200 people were declared bankrupt.  The difference between the two jurisdictions is the cost factor in going into bankruptcy.  I speak for small businesses and those who suffered as a knock-on effect of not being paid.  I refer to small contractors, small shopkeepers and householders.  It is not economic for them to go into bankruptcy and MABS advises them not to do so.The second factor is the time period for the discharge of bankruptcy.  In the UK, one can be discharged from bankruptcy within 12 months.  In Ireland, it is five years if one is a good boy and follows everything.  Otherwise, it can increase to 12 years.  This measure may bring us into line with what our neighbours on this island are doing.  In the United States, under chapter 7 legislation, those who use the provisions of chapter 7 legislation are not allowed to go into bankruptcy for another six years.  If we reduced the period to 12 months, 18 months or two years, we could include a stipulation that people cannot go into bankruptcy for a set period.  I will not deliberate on other measures contained in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider some of my comments this evening.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, a comprehensive Bill containing many important provisions in a diverse number of areas.  I make reference to the amendments the Bill makes in the area of civil liability for good samaritans and volunteers, which I welcome.  However, we need clarification on the definitions of the actions that qualify as those of a good samaritan.  The Bill requires that a person must be in serious and imminent danger or apparently in serious and imminent danger.  Is this a subjective or an objective test?  In the interest of fairness for the good samaritan, the test must be subjective.  A situation that does not present a serious, imminent or apparently serious and imminent threat, could quickly change into one that does.  Hence, the test should be that the good samaritan believes the threat to be serious and imminent or one that could quickly escalate into being serious and imminent.  A possible flaw in the Bill is that it does not impose an obligation to provide reasonable assistance at the scene of an accident.  There is no other provision in Irish law to require a person to come to the aid of another stranger.  This Bill provides the opportunity to debate the introduction of some form of legal duty to assist, similar to that in many jurisdictions.Part 5 of the Act concerns intoxicating liquor and codes of conduct.  While the section is broadly welcome, I ask the Minister to publish and endorse a single code of conduct so that all people involved in the sale and supply of alcohol know the rules and where they stand.  The last thing the industry needs is a variety of codes for display, sale, supply, advertising, promotion and marketing of alcohol being published by different organisations.  This will lead only to confusion and people in the industry need to know their obligations under the code.Part 7 of the Bill, concerning the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1998, is most welcome.  I welcome the fact that legislation reduces the period under which a person can apply to the courts to be discharged from bankruptcy from 12 years to five years.  As alluded to by Deputy Lawlor, this remains a long period by international standards.  I see no reason it cannot be reduced further.  I look forward to the publication next year of the personal insolvency Bill.Part 8 concerns the maintenance of spouses and children.  It is important that people live up to their responsibilities in respect of maintenance payments where orders are made.  It is essential that a strong message is sent out that an unwillingness to pay should be discouraged by the threat of being found in contempt of court and the resultant possibility of imprisonment.  The courts need a strong sanction in order to force people to live up to their responsibilities to their families.  The Bill makes an important distinction between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  The amendment of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 is to be greatly welcomed.  Without this amendment, the flaw in the Act is that after 1 December 2012 major difficulties would be caused to many homeowners and landowners across the country.Without the registered rights of way allowing access to their homes, their properties will be effectively worthless in future.  The requirement to seek court orders to enable registration of uncontested easements and profits à prendre was an unnecessary financial burden on home owners in these recessionary times and, therefore, I welcome this change.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I welcome the provisions included in the Bill to strengthen the various laws and make them more effective.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Shatter, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and their staff for the excellent work they have done in bringing the Bill before the House in advance of the Dáil recess.I wish to address the amendments on human trafficking, good samaritans, volunteers and domestic violence.  Human trafficking is a lucrative criminal activity now rivalling the drugs trade.  It is criminalised under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 carrying penalties up to life imprisonment.  It is a crime which does not feature often in headlines but it is a crime of which we as a society must be aware and be vigilant to combat.  It is modern slavery and it is on the increase.  Human trafficking is rooted in equality and social marginalisation.  Its victims are exploited for sexual, labour and organ removal reasons.  Sadly, an increasing number of migrant women need help to escape the stranglehold of criminals.I welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána has identified trafficking of human beings as a priority in its annual policing plan, with the Garda National Immigration Bureau specialising in this area.  Its work in identifying individuals to the Legal Aid Board as potential victims means that no means test or financial contribution is required by the alleged victim.  I seek clarification on that as there appears to be some distinction between advice and taking cases to court.The Legal Aid Board does excellent work and provides solicitors who have received specific training in human trafficking issues.  The Legal Aid Board now having this statutory backing means it can provide legal advice all through the criminal justice process to alleged victims of human trafficking in regard to trafficking or any other offence.  That will ensure that victims will now be fully protected and advised on their role as a witness.  That is as it should be as many are reluctant and frightened about the repercussions in coming forward as witnesses against criminals.The proposal will also support the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and a UN protocol on trafficking in persons, especially of women and children.  Ireland is also a member of the European G6 human trafficking initiative together with the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.  The aim is that the EU will become an impossible place for criminals to engage in the trafficking of human beings.I welcome the Part of the Bill dealing with the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers, which implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers.  We have a wonderful tradition of volunteering and community spirit and to have good samaritans hesitate to act in good faith to provide assistance in an accident or emergency owing to the fear of litigation at a later date is unthinkable.  That this provision will protect good samaritans from liability is an excellent element of the Bill.The strengthening of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 is to enable a safety order to be applied to obtain full protection of the law against the other parent of the children in cases where people who may never have had an active role in their family's life can turn up at any time and intimidate a family.  I know anecdotally of circumstances where parents turn up from other countries not having had any involvement in their families' lives and proceed to intimidate them.  I welcome this part of the Bill and the fact that the protections are extended to opposite sex and same sex couples.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I reiterate the point made by many speakers about the Irish language translation.  I am aware some assurance has been given in that regard but as with civil liberties, for example, an issue like the Irish language is not something that would disappear overnight but would get chipped away at, so to speak.  It is important that we are vigilant in that regard.  I am not a speaker of Irish but I made the investment in my children going to an all-Irish school and therefore I would be supportive of the use of the language in as many applications as possible.This is certainly a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  It is a dolly mixture of many different issues, some of which I would support.  I thank the Library and Research Service for its good work on the explanatory booklet, which is very helpful.On the good samaritan section, the way it is described tends to focus on people who come across an accident, but something people often complain and feel aggrieved about is in cases of an attack where people stand by and do not intervene.  Is it intended to give some comfort or protection to people in that category because it is a very unfortunate feature of today's society that people do not intervene?  Such a measure would encourage them to do that.  People who have been attacked often feel doubly aggrieved if there were many people around them but there was no intervention.The Bill refers to the reduction in the number of people who volunteer from 33% in 1999 to 17% in 2006.  That figure will alter again because we are recapturing some of today's better values.  There are some encouraging signs in regard to people getting involved in activities in that many have more time on their hands than they would wish.I would like to see training in first aid provided in schools because when people intervene, they can sometimes do more harm than good, especially in circumstances where victims are moved and so on.  Some basic training would be very useful and might be something from which we would benefit.This document refers to the duty of care being silent and does not determine what is meant by it but, instead, says the courts will be relied upon on a case-by-case basis.  I am not sure if that is a good idea.  We are better off defining aspects because too often the courts have ruled that a matter has not been legislated for, and I would be concerned about that.The other aspect in regard to this category is about the protection for health care professionals.  I have come across situations where a doctor has not attended but has advised people, in the case of an accident, to ring for an ambulance because they did not feel the necessary protections were in place.  I would like to see that specific area protected because those situations arise and very often they can be important in terms of the time involved in responding, particularly to road traffic accidents.On the area of human trafficking, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has been supportive but it has also been critical in terms of the Bill not going far enough.  I would endorse some of the criticisms it makes in that where legal advice is available, the only legal representation available is where the person is being questioned on their own past sexual history.  The representation should be extended far beyond that.On the intoxicating liquor aspect, the Bill states that the Minister may but is not obliged to seek submissions.  I would like to see that provision strengthened where there is an absolute requirement to do that.  It is always useful to get input from as wide a variety of people as possible.Regarding the area of bankruptcy, I am disappointed that we are not seeing more people coming forward earlier in regard to the very good work of the Law Reform Commission in dealing with personal debt management.  I took the trouble to read the extensive document in recent months and some very good work is being done that could be put into legislation fairly quickly.Many people are in serious trouble owing to personal indebtedness.  The Bill deals with bankruptcy and there are some welcome provisions in that regard.  I would like to see them extended further, however.  A timeline of three years rather than five would be more appropriate.  I welcome the extension of the time in which one can offload assets and escape liabilities as a consequence.Does the furnishing of a passport or equivalent document apply in the case of people seeking refugee status?  Very often people arrive in the country who are fleeing for their lives.  While I understand there must be certainty over people not destroying documents before they arrive here, exceptions must be borne in mind.  The Bill may present a difficulty in this regard.With regard to non-compliance with orders for maintenance, the penalty established in the Bill really fits the crime.  I have been asked for advice on this matter in many houses.  It is mostly women who go through hearing after hearing in the courts to obtain a final decision on the paying of maintenance, only to find that the maintenance obligations set out are not met.  They must then return to the courts and they end up with large legal bills.  In some cases, they just give up.  We all have experience of these cases.  It is essential that there be a penalty to modify behaviour.  One cannot ask that the father of the child be declared and at the same time not impose an adequate sanction if maintenance is not paid.  The Bill represents a positive step in this regard.This is very much a "miscellaneous provisions" Bill; it is best described using that term.  If anybody asks me what a miscellaneous provisions Bill is, I will give him a copy of this one.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is a wide-ranging civil law Bill.  I want to concentrate in my comments on amendments to the Official Languages Act 2003, the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, the Immigration Act 2004 and the intoxicating liquor Acts.The recognition of the Irish language is vital for our State and people.  The amendment to the Official Languages Act that proposes to allow legislation not to be published simultaneously in both official languages seriously undermines the status of our native language.  I am reminded of the long campaign that was supported by this House to have the Irish language recognised as an official language of the European Union, yet we now see the Government undermining this with the proposed amendment.  When this is allied to the proposals of Fine Gael to remove Irish as a compulsory subject for the leaving certificate, as highlighted during the election campaign, it does not bode well for the future of the Irish language and efforts to support its growth.I appeal to the Minister to remove the proposed amendment for the following reasons.  The programme for Government promises a review of the Official Languages Act 2003.  No changes to the Act should be made before that review and the inclusion of stakeholders in the process.  A second translation department was set up in 2009.  The two translation departments should be reorganised to translate the Acts in an acceptable timeframe for the work of the Oireachtas.  The amendment, if made, will lead to a reduction in the status of Irish.I welcome the changes proposed to provide legal advice to the victims of human trafficking, who are mainly women, but I do not think they go far enough.  The European Council has said that human trafficking is "a phenomenon [that] has hit unprecedented levels, to the extent that it can be considered a new form of slavery".  According to a report by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, between January 2007 and September 2008, 102 women were identified by ten services as having been trafficked into or through Ireland.  These women were aware of a further 64 women who were trafficked into Ireland.The provisions only provide for legal advice to victims in regard to possible court appearances associated with criminal procedures.  The women should be provided with free advice in regard to all their legal requirements associated with being in the State.  They are here through no fault of their own, have gone through an extremely traumatic experience and should have the full assistance of the State, be it with immigration matters or the provision of advice.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter serious consideration.There is no doubt that section 12 of the Immigration Act needs to be amended.  It is a pity we had to be forced to do so by the courts.  Such a section should not have been allowed into the legislation at all.  This very broad provision meant that any non-Irish national, or anyone whom a Garda or immigration officer believed to be a non-Irish national, had to produce appropriate identification on demand, without any explanation, or face possible prosecution.  The number of prosecutions under section 12 rose from three in 2005 to 291 in 2008.The courts have recognised that the State has a right and duty to impose immigration controls, and that these controls may include measures which are harsher than those imposed on nationals.  However, any law that criminalises actions must be clear and certain.  Section 12 certainly is not clear.  Under the new provisions, it will still be a requirement that a non-national produce a valid passport or equivalent document on demand, but the Bill qualifies the meaning of "on demand".  The demand must be made by the Minister, an immigration officer or a member of An Garda Síochána, and it must be made for a particular purpose, that is, to establish the person is not in the State in contravention of the Immigration Act.  The operation of this amended section needs to be monitored closely to ensure it is not abused and people are not unduly penalised.  Although there is a defence provided for in the legislation for not complying with the demand, will it only be in the courts that a person can have this defence taken into account?I would like to comment on the Bill's codes of practice for the sale of alcohol.  The focus of comments seems to have been mainly on the sale of alcohol in public houses.  I ask the Minister to focus also on the sale of alcohol in supermarkets.  It seems we are moving very quickly to circumstances in which the majority of alcohol will be sold through supermarkets.  I ask the Minister to use the codes of practice to ban below-cost selling of alcohol in supermarkets, which practice is leading to there being alcohol on demand in society.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation, which I regard as extremely important.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  The only point that worries me is that it affects many facets of our lives.  It spreads the net very broadly in terms of the application of the law.  It contains many improvements, such as the good samaritan provision, the provision of legal advice to victims of human trafficking, the codes pertaining to intoxicating liquor, which were mentioned by other Members, and measures on bankruptcy.I welcome the proposals on the good samaritan.  Will the Minister refer in his reply to the question of proximity and the degree to which a good samaritan can, in good faith, attempt to offer assistance in an emergency given that he or she may find out later that somebody else may adjudicate on whether he or she should have offered assistance at the time in question?  Reference was made to the degree of competence of the good samaritan.  The Bill will insert section 51D to the Civil Liability Act 1961, under which there must be close proximity between the apprehended injury and the intervention.  In other words, if a person is in serious and imminent danger of loss of life or worse injury then an intervention should take place for which somebody would be covered under the Act.  However, I ask the Minister to clarify in his reply the situation whereby a person does not have an adequate level of competence to be able to make a determination as to what is imminent and serious.We all know the old story of the well-meaning and well-intentioned person who offers assistance at a roadside crash.  There may be imminent tragic circumstances such as a danger of the vehicle going on fire with obvious consequences.  However, if this is not the case and a serious back or neck injury ensues after a person who is not qualified attempts to offer assistance, to what extent will this person be covered?  I ask the Minister to make reference to this.The Bill does not address the question of whether a duty of care exists in any particular circumstances.  It is silent on what categories of intervention would attract a duty of care.  Must a good samaritan intervening in a particular situation make a commitment to continue in attendance at whatever cost?  There may be other imminent and pressing dangers.  These issues need to be brought into focus.  I note the Law Reform Commission has made a number of recommendations in this area.Reference has been made to human trafficking.  We all know of cases where there has been clear evidence of trafficking of children and teenagers.  Unfortunately, ample evidence exists of many such people having gone missing in this jurisdiction but no evidence exists of where they ended up.  This is sad and I hope the provisions in this Bill will deal with this.  The Bill also makes reference to the harvesting of organs and all that goes with it.I have two views on bankruptcy.  In many cases, bankruptcy is harsh and may unnecessarily inflict huge penalties on a person doing his or her best trying to remain solvent, to discharge his or her debts and to be of good behaviour in this regard.  Others have made it a badge of honour to avoid their responsibilities and every possible opportunity of discharging their financial responsibilities.  They will use every loophole possible available to them and sometimes the law appears to assist them.Will the Minister give an indication on the case of a householder with a liability of €500,000 who discharges €400,000 but is then put into bankruptcy because he or she has not discharged the remainder?  I dealt with a case of this nature in the very recent past.  This is unfair.  In the case with which I am familiar, it was unfair of the financial institution to proceed in this fashion.  It took mean advantage of the situation and has unnecessarily penalised the unfortunate person, who will be forced to remain out of business.  Even the length of time envisaged in the Bill would be too great a penalty in this case.The provisions in the Bill on the enforcement of maintenance orders are a good idea.  It is important also to recognise that in the present economic climate it is difficult to enforce maintenance orders because the person against whom the order is about to be made may well be unemployed and may have the entitlement of a single person receiving a social welfare payment or a basic payment.  The possibility of putting the person in prison until payment is made is not a worthwhile proposition.  In all the cases which I have dealt with over the years one would tend to be cautious when asking people who have limited means to go through legal channels to enforce maintenance orders.  Agreement between the couple, if possible, is a better option.The proposals on the requirement for immigrants to have identification papers or passports is a good idea.  However, people have arrived on our shores with no identification whatsoever.  Perhaps their families have been summarily executed; this is not the normal situation but it has happened.  I am sure everyone in the House has come across cases where a person was the only remaining living member of a family, because the rest of the family was murdered or slaughtered or however you want to phrase it.  Will the Minister dwell on this for an instant to determine what type of identification papers might be acceptable in such cases?I am most concerned about easements.  For those of us who, for our many sins, live in rural Ireland the definitions of a right of way, an easement, or a liability accruing therefrom can raise the temperature very considerably.  I have dealt with cases on this, as I am sure has everyone else in the House.  It is the easiest thing in the world for a person who has no entitlement to anything on somebody else's property to pretend he or she has and to proceed to register an entitlement or an implied entitlement over a long period of time.  I have very little respect for people who spend their time eyeing up other people's property with a view to getting a share of it or an entitlement to part of it or to being compensated in order to relinquish part of an alleged entitlement as a result of their clever manoeuvring of the system over a period of time.  I realise fully that what is proposed is to ease the system to be more amenable to e-registration.  Will the Minister respond to this?I am concerned about the e-system.  Some weekends each of us receives 500 or 600 e-mails.  I often ask myself what people do in their spare time if they have the time to write 600 or 700 e-mails.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	555	People devote themselves to a particular subject such as registering an entitlement, easement or potential burden on someone else's house or garden, something previously deemed to be a public property or an unregistered property — a distinction is made between registered and unregistered property.  Given the cases that have gone through the courts, I would have thought this area is open to a great deal of argument in the courts — very expensive argument I might add and this is no reflection on the legal eagles who would participate in such an argument.I question the wisdom of making it overly simple for somebody to register his or her interest in another person's property.  Some account should be taken of the manner in which such an event occurs.  If enough people were so interested in other people's property the famous old rural Irish tradition of a legacy from the United States would become non-existent because somebody would have eyed up the property beforehand, identified the fact that nobody was immediately around and that there was the potential for somebody to register an interest in such a way as to argue he or she had an entitlement to it knowing full well he or she had no entitlement whatsoever.  I have serious concerns about the degree to which this intended improvement in the legislation might be abused.  As an experienced legal practitioner, the Minister will be aware of the many hotly contested cases which have been thrashed out in the courts on the basis of a perceived or acquired entitlement to another person's property.  For example, in my constituency if a person has obtained sand or gravel from his neighbour's gravel pit, it could easily transpire that he has acquired an entitlement thereafter because he has established a use.  I ask the Minister to indicate how such matters will be thrashed out.The Bill proposes beneficial improvements in the area of domestic violence.  All Deputies will have encountered cases of individuals failing to observe protection orders and barring orders and being held in contempt of court.  Incidentally, I was almost invited to be in contempt of court in a particular case some time ago.  I attended court at the request of the defendant when evidence without basis in fact was proffered.  The wise judge was not prepared to accept it, however.  While one cannot legislate for such circumstances, the fact remains that in such circumstances individuals may be disadvantaged and incur significant expenditure extricating themselves from the position in which they find themselves.I note the number of convictions for failure to produce identification increased from three in 2005 to 144 in 2006, 250 in 2007 and 291 in 2008.   This is a substantial evolution, for want of a better description, of the application of the law.  The majority of such convictions arise from immigration matters.  For example, some people deliberately go AWOL because they have been refused refugee status, while others are re-circulated so many times within the system they no longer know whether they are in or out of the jurisdiction.  I am concerned by the dramatic rise in only four years in the number of convictions secured for failure to produce identification.I discussed burdens, easements and rights of way.  The right of an individual to register a burden on another person's property requires the production of significant supporting information.  I would not agree to the establishment of such a right unless it was clear that the person on whose property the burden would be placed would not have his or her rights undermined as a result of a clever connivance made over a number of years by an individual who had a precise plan to register such a burden.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I thank Deputies on all sides who have contributed to the debate.  As I stated, I appreciate the Bill is wide-ranging, genuinely miscellaneous in the context of the number of areas it covers and ranges across provisions in 40 different statutes.  I also appreciate the welcome given by Deputies on all sides to a variety of the provisions contained in the Bill.  I also express appreciation for the co-operation we have received from the Opposition in being able to order Committee Stage relatively quickly so as to facilitate enactment of the legislation before the summer recess.  This will be of particular assistance to a number of people, which is welcome.  This is the type of legislation that we can deal with in this way.I will do my best to respond to many of the comments that have been made.  If I do not deal with some, I hope I will be forgiven because we will have an opportunity to deal with them more specifically on a section basis on Committee Stage.  I will try as best I can to cover the broad range of issues that have been raised.   At an early stage in the debate, Deputies Calleary and O'Brien raised issues arising out of representations they have received from the Irish Heart Foundation.  Various Deputies raised issues with regard to work undertaken by an individual as a good samaritan who intervenes in an emergency, as prescribed by the legislation, or work undertaken by a volunteer acting under the aegis of a voluntary organisation.  The Irish Heart Foundation has been in contact with my Department in the development of the provisions of the Bill dealing with volunteers and voluntary organisations.  Its views have been taken into account and regard has also been taken of the report of the Law Reform Commission and the advice of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel.The further suggestions of the Irish Heart Foundation have been studied in my Department and were taken seriously.  However, it is my view that the provisions in Part 3 with regard to the various definitions in question are sufficient and provide all of the various protections that are required in dealing with volunteers acting on behalf of an organisation such as the Irish Heart Foundation.  It was of assistance and valuable that the foundation engaged with us.  I give this assurance because I appreciate its concerns are genuine and come from a body that does important and valuable work and with which many people over the years have been engaged.In the context of the general provisions relating to good samaritans, they are concerned with an individual who intervenes in what is described essentially as an emergency.  This is where an event occurs and an individual, without any expectation of payment or reward, comes to the help of another individual.  Some Deputies asked how one would know what expertise a good samaritan possesses.  People may intervene to be of assistance to others in a broad range of circumstances.  It may well be that a medical emergency arises and a qualified medical practitioner appears on the scene, intervenes and is of help.  Equally, someone could have an accident or there could be a medical emergency and there may not be anyone nearby who has any qualifications and an ordinary, unqualified individual may try to be of assistance to someone who has been the victim of a car crash, has had a fall and broken a leg or has suddenly taken ill, for example, on a beach or golf course.  Where someone in good faith seeks to intervene to be of assistance, essentially the legislation states that he or she will not be held liable in negligence.  However, where someone intervenes in bad faith, for example, a person, knowing that he does not have a particular expertise attempts to do something of which he has absolutely no knowledge and does not know if he will be of any help to anyone, that person could be regarded as having intervened in circumstances in which he or she is being grossly negligent, knowing that he or she is going well beyond his or her competence to the extent that what he or she does may pose a danger to an individual.   Whether someone has intervened in good or bad faith or is grossly negligent or merely ordinarily negligent, that is, where something goes wrong, although the person acts in good faith, are issues about which one cannot be absolutely exact.  The courts have detailed the concept of negligence and differentiated it from gross negligence.The recommendations and prescriptions of the Law Reform Commission in these areas were taken on board, together with the advice of the Attorney General, in drafting the Bill.  Some of these issues are analysed in detail in the commission's report.  The formula we have, dealing with matters that could be of concern when someone intervenes as a good samaritan or is engaged as a volunteer for an organisation, follows the recommendations received.  The changes in the legislation should provide a degree of protection and comfort for individuals that is not provided by the current law and that I hope will be seen as particularly valuable.A number of Deputies raised the issue of the licensing laws and liquor legislation.  It is important that individuals drink responsibly, as those who have licences to sell alcohol, whether to be consumed on or off premises, should behave responsibly.  On occasion, we may talk too much about those who sell alcohol and not enough about those who consume it.  It is important that those who consume alcohol do so responsibly and take responsibility for their own actions.  We are all thinking human beings.  There are circumstances where people drink excessively, are not addicted and know they are drinking excessively.  We cannot always blame the supermarket where alcohol was purchased for the foolish and unwise behaviour of individuals.  We must take personal responsibility for our actions.It is important that the licensed trade operates responsibly.  There is and has been during the years a problem with alcohol being sold at a loss by retail outlets to attract custom.  That can make alcohol more readily affordable and attract young people into acquiring more alcohol than they might normally do.  It is important that outlets behave in a responsible manner.Breaches of the guidelines envisaged in the legislation will not result in criminal prosecution.  However, following the guidelines being put in place, if someone sells alcohol in a manner contrary to them and gives rise to problems, their failure to comply with them can be used to oppose their being granted a licence in the District Court.  This will be an additional weapon for communities where a public house or an off-licence is being run irresponsibly and in the armoury of the Garda in raising issues in the annual licensing courts as to whether it is appropriate to renew a licence.Deputy Calleary referred to the bankruptcy provisions, while other Deputies referred to them in different ways, some supportive and some critical.  The Bill's provisions in the area of bankruptcy are interim arrangements.  They are a small step along the road to introducing reform.  A detailed insolvency Bill is being prepared in my Department.  It will provide new mechanisms for dealing with insolvency and allow for insolvency issues to be addressed within structures outside the court system in a less expensive way.  It will also prescribe a range of new rules.  The Bill takes the first interim step in bringing about reform to allow bankruptcies in place for more than 12 years to be terminated and the office which deals with bankruptcies to write off the legacy issues that need to be dealt with before the new legislation is in place.  I welcome the reactions of Deputies Calleary and O'Brien who were largely supportive of what we were doing.In the Seanad and my Department we had a debate on whether the rule allowing bankruptcies to end at 12 years should be brought down to three or five years.  There is no magic number.  Deputy Durkan and others also touched on this issue.  There is a range of problems in dealing with bankruptcy.  There are individuals who have led responsible lives who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in substantial financial difficulty.  This may be as a consequence of the reckless trading of someone else.  I could be running a small business in a decent and responsible way and doing business with another firm for years and allowing it credit.  In years gone by my bills might have been paid and over a period of time I might have allowed the credit made available to mount up.  If the other business which is being run, perhaps, recklessly goes bankrupt, my debts will not be paid and my business will go to the wall as a consequence.  I may be entirely innocent in the whole affair but could find myself facing bankruptcy in circumstances where I am a personal trader, not a limited liability company.That is a profile of two bankruptcies.  There is the innocent trader whose life is being brought to ruin and the reckless business for which that trader provided a product.  The reckless owner may have drawn too much money from his business, bought expensive cars he could not afford and gone on expensive holidays, while the owner of the other business led a modest life.  We must strike a balance within our bankruptcy laws where we do not reward those who trade recklessly and destroy other people's lives, while finding a mechanism to facilitate those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves facing bankruptcy to get out of that state, rebuild their lives and have the possibility of borrowing money and starting up businesses.We decided on the five year rule to see how it would work.  In the United Kingdom the five year period has been reduced to one year and I understand it is proving to be a problem.  Difficulties are arising where people are abusing the bankruptcy laws to trade recklessly and reconstitute themselves a year later, leaving creditors in their wake who have no chance of recovering their assets.   This is an initial step in this area.  Under the EU-IMF agreement, we must produce comprehensive insolvency legislation by the first quarter of 2012.  I am optimistic that we will manage to publish the Bill before the end of this year.  I cannot guarantee this, but the work on the measure is at an advanced stage in my Department and I am hopeful we will achieve it.  This Bill is an initial step.  It is important that we take it, but it is not the end result to which we are heading.It is important to keep the issue of bankruptcy in context because it is expensive to progress matters, even where people have substantial debts.  There are very few bankruptcies.  In 2010, despite all the economic difficulties and the many businesses and individuals that got into trouble, I am advised that a total of 27 individuals were declared bankrupt.  We do not have a large number of people who find themselves bankrupt.  However, we need a more balanced law.  A more balanced law will achieve an important social purpose in this area.With regard to the Coroners Acts, Deputy Calleary referred to the more comprehensive Bill that is to be published.  Amendments to that are required in order that we can enact it and, hopefully, we can get that through in the autumn.  The Deputy is also correct that we are working on comprehensive legislation to cover licensing laws.  The legislation in that area is spread through a series of Acts.  It is unnecessarily fragmented and too complex.  I hope we will ultimately have a codified and reforming Bill in the House.  We may not see that until after this year but work is under way.Issues were raised by a number of Members in the context of changes in dealing with easements in what are known as profits á prendre.  We can all conjure up the difficulties that arose in the well known play by a certain gentleman from Kerry, which resulted in the film, “The Field”.  It is not envisaged that this reform will generate such excitement because one can only use this mechanism if there is agreement.  One cannot register in circumstances in which there is contention over land that might be utilised for a purpose or over the use of some resource on that land.  Where there is contention, this mechanism does not apply.  It is designed to ensure that where there is no contention, one can register one’s interest in the Land Registry without incurring unnecessary legal costs and expense and without the necessity for heading down the court route.  I hope that will be welcomed.I cannot add much more to what I have said regarding the provision relating to the Irish language.  The previous Government was going to insert a similar provision in the Bill it originally published.  The previous Attorney General recommended that, as does the current Attorney General.  It is there to resolve a difficulty.  There is a timeline between when this House or the Seanad concludes Report Stage and completes the passage of legislation and the publication of the final version of a Bill.  This is not about downgrading or undermining the role of the Irish language; it is simply about ensuring that when the Houses have done their business and completed the passage of a Bill, the final wording will be available electronically within a short time to Members, the public and those who may be affected by it in order that they have access to it rather than time elapsing before it becomes available.  It is no more complex or mysterious than that.  There is no hidden agenda in the matter and I hope this practical and pragmatic amendment, which is supported by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will be supported by Members.On the issue of human trafficking raised by Deputy O'Brien and others, the purpose of the provision is to ensure victims of human trafficking who, by their very origins, are unlikely to have any familiarity with the Irish legal system have available legal advice to them in order that they understand their circumstances and if criminal prosecutions are taken against those responsible for bringing them into the country or those who may have abused them by placing them in circumstances where they are sexually exploited, that they understand the benefits to them of co-operating with the Garda, their right to remain in this country for a period, how our criminal processes work, and what is their role and that of the prosecuting authorities and the defence lawyer.They will be provided with a range of useful and important advice, which ensures we comply with our international obligations.  The advice relates to their circumstances arising from the fact that they were trafficked to Ireland and the consequent criminal proceedings that may be taken against third parties.  Witnesses in such proceedings in this State are not represented by separate groups of lawyers.  If I am seriously assaulted as I leave this House this evening and criminal proceedings are taken on the recommendation of the DPP, State counsel and solicitors will be in court.  A solicitor or a barrister would not represent me in court.  The person who is represented in the court room is the defendant.  This is the way our legal system works.  It would be quite anomalous and, indeed, unnecessary to provide for separate legal representation by solicitor and counsel in the criminal trial for the victim in those circumstances.  It is important that victims have access to legal advice in order that they can understand what is taking place.  This is not a minimalist provision; this provision meets in full our international obligations.  It is an important additional protection for the victims of human trafficking and it gives them formal statutory entitlements.  It is again something I hope Members will support.A number of Members raised the provision arising out of the recent court judgment, which will require non-nationals to produce identity documents to confirm who they are and to indicate whether they should be in the State.  There is nothing exceptional about this provision.  The difficulty that arose in the court proceedings was the vague nature of the legislation that applied.  This legislation is more specific.  In every country, there are rules about who is entitled to visit and immigration and to ensure the police force, in our case the Garda Síochána, can check the legality of the presence of individuals in the country.  The necessity to do that is clearly evidenced by the fact that over the years a large number of people entered the country illegally as economic migrants and they were not validly asylum seekers nor were they here for any other purpose.  It is important that we uphold our rules in this area to respect not only domestic law, but to show respect to those who come to this island from foreign parts lawfully.  They respect our procedures and seek the appropriate entry visas if they are from outside the EU or from countries whose nationals are required to obtain visas and, where required, they seek the appropriate work permits.  It is unfair to them that those checks do not exist.Deputies raised other issues during the debate, not all of which I have time to deal with.  The final matter I will briefly mention is imprisonment for non-payment of maintenance.  There is a genuine problem in that individuals who because of sheer intransigent bloody mindedness and not financial difficulty will not support their wives and children, or, if they are not married, will not support children born to them.  A number of individuals behave this way.  In the absence of a sanction to compel them to make payments in circumstances where they are self-employed, they are given a free pass and there is no means of ensuring the law is upheld.It is my view generally that we should not imprison people for debt if it can be avoided, but it is important — I will conclude on this — that a message goes out from this House that we expect those who have the financial means to do so, whether estranged spouses or simply parents of children born outside marriage, to meet their financial obligations to support their dependent children and spouses, and in particular we expect them to respect the laws of the country and the court orders made which require them to make particular payments.  In the event of them defying court orders, taking no notice of what the judges say, it is essential the courts have available to them in their armoury the capacity to jail people for non-payment of maintenance.  In my experience, very often the threat of that results in the recalcitrant, stubborn individual finally making the payments that he —  in most cases it is a he — is obliged to make.  That is why this particular change in the law to restore the position to where it was some years ago is so important.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Since February 2011 the provision of new rent allowance and mortgage assistance claims for my constituents in Dublin North are being directed to a PO box address in Santry.  It has resulted in the removal of yet another localised service from some of the most vulnerable in society.  Previously new rent supplement applications were handled by community welfare officers, CWOs.  Applicants could meet a CWO in person, discuss their situation and in response, the applicant would get instant advice and help.  I find it incredible that this service has been removed from community welfare officers.  CWOs provided face-to-face contact for people who need the allowance.  They could give advice and counsel but most importantly decisions were made in a short time, usually within one week.  With the new system, there are delays of up to five or six weeks whereby people are left in an anxious limbo, waiting on a decision.As public representatives we all deal with emergency cases where people are in need of a quick decision on their rent supplement.  That may be as a result of domestic violence, abuse or health problems.  Until February 2011, such emergency cases could be dealt with directly through community welfare officers who could provide advice in a timely manner.  Now people are directed to the PO box address and a system which is totally faceless.  Although the new system offers a telephone number for queries, the delays for getting calls answered are very long.  Many people I have spoken to do not even get an answer when they call the number.  In fact, to confirm what I had been told on the ground, a member of my staff made a test call to the number this week to verify the delay and was left listening to a ringing telephone for 35 minutes before he gave up.  I suggest that the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, try the number for himself.  It is 1800 303413.The service is not worthy of the Department of Social Protection and it is certainly not good enough for the people of Dublin North.  It seems that we have swapped a functioning service for a bad service, with absolutely no explanation on why the change was made.  I have been informed by a number of CWOs that the changes were not driven by a lack of capacity to deliver the service locally.  I understand there are proposals for existing rent and mortgage claims to be transferred to the new centralised facility in the near future.  Before any further claims are transferred to the new facility, I call for a full and detailed explanation on why new applications have been taken away from CWOs.  Is it part of an overall strategy and, if so, what is the strategy?  Does the Department recognise that the current process is failing people in need of rent supplement?I know the Minister is committed to reform of the social welfare system in this country.  The changes were not introduced under her watch.  However, reform is not about removing a functioning system and replacing it with one that is less effective.  We must remember that those seeking rent allowance or mortgage assistance are looking for help for that most basic of requirements, namely, shelter.  The provision of a roof over one's head is something that some may take for granted but there are people who face such insecurity on a daily basis.  That is why we must ensure that the social welfare service meets a number of requirements, not least in the area of efficiency.The new service is not efficient.  Waiting times are excessive.  Customer service is virtually non-existent and the delays are having a negative impact on people in need of financial support for housing.  I have asked that the decision be reversed with immediate effect.  I hope the Minister of State can respond positively to the request, but at a minimum I ask him to address the problems I have described.  The response provided to me tonight will be based on a report from the Minister's officials.  It will, of necessity, have been prepared in advance and if experience tells me anything, it might suggest that all is well.  However, I assure the Minister of State that all is not well.I accept that we must reform the public service but part of the reform must include a challenge to treat recipients of the service as real people — customers and not mere statistics.  The reformed public service to which I look forward must be about efficiency but it must also be about customer service and the need for continual improvement in that regard.  The problem I have raised tonight is about none of those and improves nothing.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response and in particular to anything he might say specifically on the points I have made tonight.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this important issue.  I listened actively to his points and I will address some of them if I can.  I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who conveys her apologies to Deputy Ryan for being unable to attend and reply in person.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is currently administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare services division of the Health Service Executive.  Late last year agreement was reached between the Health Service Executive, HSE, and unions representing the community welfare officers that the staff of the community welfare service, CWS, would transfer to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011 on a secondment basis initially.  The period of secondment is to last for nine months until the end of September 2011.  During this period the staff will remain employees of the HSE but are subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Protection.  From 1 October 2011 it is intended that the staff of the CWS will be transferred fully to the Department as civil servants and will be accountable to the Minister in the same way as other civil servants.Historically, rent supplements have been administered locally by community welfare officers directly to the customer.  I note Deputy Ryan's point about customer satisfaction, which is paramount.  Based on what Deputy Ryan said, the service is appalling.  I hope the people dealing with the issue are listening to his contribution and will take on board what he stated.  However, as a result of a large increase in claims being made in recent years and the restriction on staff recruitment in the service, it was decided that priority must be given to the demand on the local service for claims where an immediate decision is needed, such as basic payments and exceptional needs payments.  It was considered that rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units.  As Deputy Ryan indicated, that is not the case.  It is important that the Minister is made aware of the situation.  I will speak to her on the matter.  The points raised by Deputy Ryan must be taken on board and addressed.A unit to provide the service was set up on the north side of Dublin in December 2010 to take claims from Balbriggan, Swords and other areas of north Dublin where a large increase in demand for rent supplement had been experienced.  As the Deputy is aware, it is a matter for all Departments and public sector organisations to continue to manage services with diminishing resources taking advantage of business re-engineering possibilities as provided for in the Public Service Agreement 2010-14.  The Department has been advised that there are arrangements in place for customers to contact the centralised processing unit in question.  A free telephone line — although I listened to the Deputy's comments about the 30-minute waiting time — for the central rents unit is open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2.15 p.m. to 5 p.m.  However, due to the volume and complexity of calls received, some callers may experience a delay before their calls are answered.  Customers can also contact the central rents unit by post at PO Box 11905, Dublin 9, or by e-mail at communitywelfareservice@hse.ie.  I have no doubt the Deputy knows all of this.  Documents may also be received by fax.The Department has been further advised that a number of staff in the CWS were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months, including some of the staff of the rent unit in question.  These contracts were subsequently extended to June 2011 and are to be gradually withdrawn before the transfer of the CWS to the Department of Health from October.  This has placed the unit under increased pressure and resulted in some delays in the processing of claims.A number of transition managers have been appointed from within the CWS to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to the Department of Health and manage the day-to-day administration of the service.  The relevant transition managers are currently in the process of examining the service implications arising from the loss of these temporary staff, particularly from the rent units.  They are also examining the model being used to deliver the service to ensure that the most efficient process will be used to improve service delivery, which I certainly hope will happen.  Further initiatives are also proposed which will result in improvements in the delays currently being experienced.  The matter is being given priority.The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of applicants' incomes, bank statements and information from landlords.  In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time-consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third-party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if applicants are slow to respond to requests for additional information.The provision of a prompt service is a major objective and this will continue after the transfer of functions takes place.  However, this must be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated.  While certain cases may take more time to process than others, overall the Department is satisfied that the CWS makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner and that improvements will occur as a result of the current initiatives.  There are no plans to reverse the decision to centralise the administration of rent supplement claims for Balbriggan, Swords and other areas of North Dublin.I will convey the points raised by the Deputy to the Minister for Social Protection and I have no doubt she will consider them.  I hope the improvements I have outlined will address some of these concerns.  This may not be the reply the Deputy was seeking, but the Minister will take note of the Deputy's contribution and I hope she will consider some of the actions that may be required to improve the service.

If I gave an example of what I am talking about, it might clarify the matter.  I hope the Minister will take this into consideration and significantly increase the prescribed income limits.The example to which I refer is a family of four consisting of a husband, wife and two children.  The husband is working full-time for about €11 per hour, which is the equivalent of a take-home pay of €438 per week or €22,776 per annum.  The family, which is obviously on a low income, is also in receipt of family income supplement of €99 per week.  The wife is a full-time housewife who does not work outside the home.  The family holds a medical card and is currently paying €150 per week to a landlord for private rented accommodation.  They receive no rent supplement because the husband works full-time.  Their take-home income, including the family income supplement, is €537 per week, but after paying €150 per week in rent, their net income is €387 per week, which is similar to the minimum wage.  This must cover the ongoing day-to-day expenses of a husband, wife and two children.That family is €500 over the income limit for local authority housing.  In addition, they cannot be approved for a mortgage because the husband is not earning enough.  The family would be better off with no wage earner; taking into account the €150 per week rent, they would be better off in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit.  They are in limbo, unable to be approved for a house or obtain a mortgage.  They are stuck in a situation in which they are on a very low income but must still pay €150 per week with no rent supplement.This is unsustainable and is causing significant difficulties for large numbers of housing applicants.  I hope the Minister will consider this and increase the prescribed income limits significantly to ensure families with wage-earners on low income can be approved for local authority housing.The cases of applicants who were approved for housing prior to 1 April, the date on which the new regulations were introduced, are now being reviewed.  I hope the Minister will agree that those who were approved for local authority houses before 1 April should retain their approval and be housed in the normal way.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the income limits significantly.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I thank Deputy Healy for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who conveys his apologies to Deputy Healy as he is unable to attend due to official Government business abroad.I start by emphasising that the prescribed income limits referred to by the Deputy are solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for social housing support and have no bearing on access to mortgages from local authorities or financial institutions.Prior to the enactment of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, most, though not all, local authorities operated some sort of income eligibility criteria for access to social housing support.  The manner in which these were enforced varied from place to place.  I listened to Deputy Healy's points about the difficulties these income limits cause.  There were also significant differences in how income limits were defined.  Some related to gross income; some made an allowance for rent being paid.  Some included all income, including child benefit and so on, while others disregarded a range of different sources of income.  The result of this was considerable inconsistency in the way in which social housing was allocated, which meant that applicants for support who were on similar incomes could be treated very differently because of where they happened to live.  This was neither equitable nor efficient.  On 1 April 2011, parts of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support were commenced and a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing was introduced in every housing authority.  This includes a requirement that applicants only need to apply to one housing authority to be placed on up to three waiting lists, provides for the use of a standard application form and sets maximum net income limits based on the cost of housing in the area in question.  The ultimate aim of the new system is to create a fairer, more consistent and transparent approach to eligibility for social housing support.The new maximum income limit is clearer and fairer, being a fixed figure depending on the size of the household.  The income for eligibility purposes is gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Child benefit and several temporary incomes are also disregarded.The income limits are set out in three bands and each housing authority is assigned to one of these bands.  Assignment is based on an assessment of the income needed to meet a household's basic needs in the area of choice having regard to local rental costs.  Accordingly, the three bands take account of the variation in the cost of private rented accommodation across the country.  The principle behind determining what is reasonably affordable for any household is the relationship of household income to the cost of providing suitable accommodation in the private sector, particularly rented accommodation.  These levels had been set by reference to what is generally accepted as affordable in terms of a proportion of net income.When the Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, came into office, he decided the income limits should be increased across the board by €5,000.  This was not done primarily for reasons of affordability but to create a wider catchment group from which social housing tenants are drawn, in order to promote sustainable communities.  The figure for net income of up to €35,000 for a single person household, corresponds to a gross income of almost €50,000, and is considered sufficient to secure accommodation within the private rental market or even, in some cases, to meet the costs of a mortgage.  Higher gross income thresholds apply to multiperson households.Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support and who are unable to provide for their accommodation needs from their resources.  The current income eligibility requirements achieve this.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	563	The Health Service Executive, HSE, told the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in February in a progress report what it was doing to curtail risks at several smaller hospitals.  The HSE's plans were outlined in a HIQA report in April on the quality and safety of services at Mallow General Hospital.  The HSE also identified ten other hospitals where significant risks had arisen with matters raised in the HIQA report.  One of the hospitals cited in the report is St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, County Dublin.In a response to a recent parliamentary question on this particular HIQA report on the 30 June 2011, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly stated:The recommendations in these HIQA reports need to be implemented in order to ensure the standards of care delivered in smaller hospitals are as high as possible and that the type of care provided is appropriate to the clinical setting and to the needs of patients. ? The Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland so they play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Patients should need to travel to the larger hospitals only for more complex services.  HIQA's reports on Ennis and Mallow are entirely in keeping with this approach.The HIQA report stated plans are in place to cease acceptance of emergency services at St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown and that there are plans to convert the 24-hour emergency services to a daytime minor injury unit operating as a satellite.  While a date has yet to be decided for when this is to happen, it is certain to happen this year.Following the removal of emergency services from Roscommon on Monday, there are increasing concerns that the recommendations in HIQA's report on Loughlinstown will be implemented sooner rather than later.  The people of Roscommon were given only a week's notice that their emergency services were to be removed.  There is no guarantee that the same will not happen at Loughlinstown.Last week, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, denied he had made any personal commitment to the people of Roscommon during the general election.  However, evidence has emerged that he made clear commitments to retain services.Unfortunately, it was not only Fine Gael who made an array of false promises about small hospitals.  An Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, also promised to retain services at Roscommon hospital along with other small hospitals.  Before the election campaign, Labour made a series of promises to protect small hospitals.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said the Labour Party believes in the importance of the local hospital and keeping hospital services close to where people are.  While Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, former spokesperson on Health and now Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said before the election "at present, services are being taken away from smaller hospitals and patients are being forced into centralised services that have not been given the resources to look after them.  This cannot and will not continue".The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently said he would campaign to keep a 24-hour emergency department open at St Columcille's which is in his constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  In the Irish Independent on 16 June, he was quoted as saying, “he would continue to campaign to keep them going” and “it is important that accident and emergency services are continued in St. Columcille’s Hospital and that is something I will be talking to the HSE about”.How can the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be trusted on Loughlinstown hospital after what happened at Roscommon hospital this week?  The Minister for Health must clarify the extent of his discussions on this matter with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, if he agrees with him and if any agreement has been reached to retain 24-hour emergency services at Loughlinstown.It is clear the Government made promises on Roscommon hospital which it could not keep.  This is now damaging trust in the Government and also raising fresh concerns that Loughlinstown hospital is next in line.In light of the Minister's stated intention to implement the recommendations of the HIQA report and the removal of services at Roscommon, the Minister for Health must immediately clarify if there will be a reduction in services at St. Columcille's Hospital, when exactly this will happen and what additional resources will be put in place at St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin.  He must also explain if he agrees with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, on retaining services at the hospital.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.There has been considerable debate around the issue of the role of smaller hospitals, much of which has been ill-informed.  There have been many claims around lack of resources both financial and human.  The real issue at stake is the need to ensure acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a safe and efficient manner.  It is widely recognised that safer outcomes can only be achieved through the delivery of health services in the appropriate setting.For certain medical specialties, particularly where complex care is required, many smaller hospitals do not have the throughput of patients which would enable doctors to maintain their skill levels.  This applies no matter what resources are put in place.The HSE, with the advice of HIQA, is taking steps to address the issues of safety.  The steps being taken aim to ensure the appropriate treatment will be provided in the appropriate setting.  This does not mean the closure of smaller hospitals.  The Government is committed to ensuring as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  In fact this is likely to increase the volume of services delivered while ensuring their appropriateness and effectiveness.  Patients should only have to travel to the larger hospitals for more complex services.St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is part of a joint acute hospital service operated alongside St. Vincent's University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital.  These hospitals provide a range of services associated with acute hospital provision across three sites in a collaborative arrangement.  As part of this provision, the configuration of services is constantly reviewed.  From time to time, it is reorganised to improve access and quality of service and minimise risk to patients.  While the range of services provided by the three sites will continue, the location of service provision will be configured in line with how best to deliver the service and maintain patient safety.In recent years, St. Columcille's has implemented a trauma bypass protocol which allows patients suffering major trauma to be brought directly to the most appropriate site deemed necessary to treat their condition.  These measures, combined with strong regional links to larger hospitals, are designed to ensure safety and are crucial to delivering the most effective outcomes for patients everywhere.  The HSE is working to progress these initiatives in a collaborative framework in consultation with all stakeholders.The Minister has made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority.  He wants patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity which is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.  These are the factors which will inform our future decisions on the provision of acute hospital services.  The Minister has assured the public that even in the difficult economic situation in which we find ourselves and which is the legacy left to us by the previous Government, no hospitals will close.  St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown, has a very important role to play in the provision of acute services and this will continue into the future.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in the Chamber.  This is a matter in which I have a personal interest, especially as it relates to my constituency.  Foynes Port is one of six terminals which make up the Shannon-Foynes Port Company.  Foynes is by far one of the deepest ports in Ireland and has the capacity to play a leading role in the future infrastructural development in this country.  I am seeking that joined-up thinking be displayed in respect of this matter.  I ask that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister would take the lead in this regard.  Foynes Port is located on the western seaboard and has massive potential that is not being realised at present.  It could provide a counter-balance to Dublin Port and could service the entire western seaboard.Foynes is unique in some ways in that it is serviced by a rail link.  However, that link is currently closed, which is a pity.  I do not believe it would take much to reopen the link.  It would not take much to do so with speed restrictions attached.  The latter would allow for the conveyance of bulk cargo in and out of the port.  Foynes is also served by a national secondary route, namely, the N69, which links Limerick to Tralee via Listowel.  Unfortunately, during the good days of the Celtic tiger era — and like many other routes — the N69 did not attract significant Government expenditure.  As a result, a huge number of heavy goods vehicles access Foynes Port via the N69.  These vehicles are obliged to trundle through several towns and villages along the way.  Some of them use the main regional route from Cork to Foynes via places such as Dromcollogher and Newcastle West.I am asking the Minister to consider the overall potential of Foynes Port in the context of its capability to serve as a transit point for bulk cargo and containers and also as a place where cruise liners can berth.  Everyone is aware of the fantastic tourism potential of the western seaboard.  In that regard, Foynes is the only port in the west which possess the potential to berth larger cruise liners.  In recent years increasing numbers of cruise liners have berthed at Foynes.  However, the potential that exists in the context of marketing the Shannon-Foynes Port Company, whether in the context of Limerick docks, Foynes or further down the estuary towards the mouth of the Shannon, has not registered to the degree to which it should have on the radar of the Department.I welcome the comments the Minister made at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht when I raised this matter with him.  I particularly welcome those comments in light of the current review of ports policy.  I accept that emphasis will be placed on ports such as Dublin and Cork.  However, there is a necklace of small ports along the western seaboard and questions have arisen in respect of their future viability.  I would like all the stakeholders — Limerick, Kerry and Clare county councils, the National Roads Authority, CIE, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local community — to be involved in drawing up a development plan that will include a properly integrated approach.  There is no point in developing a massive terminal on the west coast if it is not accessible.  At present, Foynes is accessible by rail but, for some reason, Iarnród Éireann is not considering this from a strategic point of view.I am seeking to establish a starting point in respect of this matter.  As already stated, Foynes Port has massive potential.  I do not believe that potential is being properly realised at present.  There is a willingness on the part of the Shannon-Foynes Port Company to drive the development of the port forward.  The Foynes Flying Boat Museum and other stakeholders are extremely interested in progressing this matter.  The new Minister has swept through his Department like a breath of fresh air.  In that context, I would like Foynes to be used as a case study for the future.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Shannon-Foynes is the second port I have visited since becoming Minister.  While there, I had the opportunity to speak to the CEO, the chairman and the management at the port, who impressed upon me the issues to which the Deputy refers.  My Department and I support and are committed to the port.  We see it as being one of our successful ports in the future.  We look forward to a time when it will be in a position to pay a dividend to the State.As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of national roads.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of both national primary and national secondary roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA — in conjunction with the local authorities concerned — under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.  Working within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is also a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.As the House will be aware, the national recovery plan published by the previous Government in November 2010 envisaged significantly reduced road investment for the duration of the plan.  As a result, the scope for proceeding with any significant road projects, including the improvement of the N69 road from Foynes, is now very limited.This Government's capital investment review, which is under way across all sectors, will form the basis for a new national development plan for the period 2012 to 2016 and will examine the costs and benefits of capital projects against a range of economic, social and environmental criteria.  Key considerations in the transport sector will be the need to protect the investment made to date in our road, rail and public transport networks and to continue with remedial safety measures.  Once the funding framework for capital expenditure is determined, it will be a matter for the NRA to prioritise projects within its funding envelope.  If I adhere to the previous Government's spending plans, no new road projects will commence from 2012 onwards.  I understand the NRA has been in contact with the Shannon-Foynes Port Company outlining its current position and indicating it will continue to carry out necessary pavement renewals and low-cost safety measures on the N69 route.On rail access to the port, I should point out that decisions relating to the reopening of rail lines, including the Limerick to Foynes rail line, are a matter for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance.  The company has advised me that it continues to engage with the Shannon-Foynes Port Company and potential customers to establish whether a viable commercial case exists to reopen the line.  Iarnród Éireann is keen to ensure the zinc from the Pallas Green mine can be moved by rail to whichever port from which it is ultimately exported.  Initial projections suggest it would cost approximately €9 million to reopen the rail link to Foynes.  Any decision in that regard would have to be taken in the context of competing demands for funding in the region and in other regions.As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, my responsibility is for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  Decisions on transport projects will be taken in the context of the capital review to which I referred earlier.  As is my position in respect of the roads element of my remit and in light of the difficult financial situation that exists, the first priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain existing investments and to maintain high safety standards.  This, of necessity, will restrict the funding for new projects.  Only those projects offering the highest return and contribution to overall economic and transport objectives, and which are affordable, have any chance of being prioritised.Iarnród Éireann has made a submission to the Department in respect of its priorities for funding under the transport capital programme.  Final decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the new national development plan.

My priorities for 2011 are to progress the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 to enactment and in that regard I would like to advise the House that the Bill will be reintroduced to the Dáil at Report Stage on Thursday next 14th July.My intention is to progress the preparation of Children First legislation in 2011 to put the Children First National Guidelines on a statutory basis. In addition, the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is a priority and a range of matters relating to the new agency, including consideration of the various functions to be discharged and associated governance arrangements, will be addressed in advance of the preparation of Heads of Bill.  In advance of this legislation to establish the Child and Family Support Agency for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, my Department is also examining putting in place legislative linkages between the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Health Service Executive in respect of the oversight of child welfare and protection services.The Heads of Bill for a National Vetting Bureau have been progressed by my Department and it has recently been agreed that these will be finalised and brought to Government by the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence in association with my Department.  The drafting of a Children's Referendum Bill will follow the consideration by Government of a revised draft wording amending the Constitution. This wording is currently being drafted by the Attorney General's Office in association with my Department and will be brought to Government as soon as this work is complete.The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill is also a priority Bill and the Heads and General Scheme will be drafted in consultation with the Adoption Authority. I am very aware of the importance of an information and tracing service for adopted persons and their birth parents and I intend to progress this Bill as quickly as possible. I am not in a position to give a specific date for publication of the Bill at this time.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The Government is committed to fundamental reform and transformation of the delivery of our children and family services.  A number of significant structural and legislative changes are key to effecting such reform.  This includes the establishment of a new agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE and reporting directly to my Department through its Chief Executive.  Preliminary work on the establishment of the new agency has been undertaken and this will now be accelerated.Among the key issues which are being progressed are the legislative and governance arrangements necessary to underpin the establishment and operation of the agency.  My Department is also working closely with the National Director for Children and Family Services within the HSE on associated matters, including the need to disaggregate the existing resource base and organisational arrangements for children and family services from the HSE in advance of the establishment of the agency.The onerous legal and operational responsibilities governing child welfare and protection services mean it is important that there is careful planning and preparation in the creation of the new agency and the assignment to it of operational responsibilities. While the precise final arrangements will take some time, I envisage transitional arrangements being put in place on a progressive basis to ensure the agency has the necessary skills, systems and structures in place to meet its responsibilities. My Department will be working very closely with the National Director for Children and Family Services and others in the HSE and beyond in the development of the new agency. As more detailed plans for the new agency are decided upon further information will be made available.  I am very appreciative of the co-operation from the HSE to date in progressing this significant change project, one which will, in my view, create the basis for delivering better outcomes for children and families nationally.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The work of the North South Steering Group on Child Protection, which is jointly chaired by my Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, includes a particular focus on the development of an inter-jurisdictional protocol for the transfer of child care cases between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. A draft protocol has been developed by a sub-group established for this purpose and is due for approval shortly. The protocol will provide for the sharing of information between the relevant statutory authorities in relation to children who move between jurisdictions and who are in care, are known to the authorities, or in respect of whom there is a level of concern.A common set of operating procedures to support this protocol, including awareness-raising and training requirements, has been developed by the sub-group for use by staff in the respective jurisdictions. The protocol will apply in the case of:—Children whose names are on the child protection register in the North or the child protection notification system in the South and who move between the jurisdictions;Children who are subject of legal orders in one jurisdiction and who move to reside in another;Children for whom there are significant welfare concerns or who are assessed as particularly vulnerable and who move between jurisdictions.I welcome the introduction of the protocol which will build on existing levels of ongoing co-operation between respective authorities North and South.

A judicial review was sought in 2009 and successfully defended by the HSE. The High Court ruling of May 2010 was then appealed to the Supreme Court. The HSE continues to strongly defend its position in relation to this matter. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to make any further public comment at this point as the matter is before the Court.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 45 and 46 together.My Department was established following a series of transfer orders on 3 June, and has taken on legal authority across a range of areas, including the functions of the former Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Functions of other Government Departments that have been transferred to the new Department are family policy and the Family Support Agency, previously the responsibility of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and the National Education and Welfare Board, which came from the Department of Education and Skills.The new Secretary General was appointed last week. A key priority task for the Secretary General will be the development of the administrative structures for the Department to ensure that it works effectively across what is a challenging brief and to maximise the benefits arising from bringing the various linked functions together.  I expect that this work will be completed in the autumn.North/South co-operation is a function that has been working well within the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) and it will be part of the structures of the new Department. The issue of child protection features prominently in Health Sectoral meetings of the North South Ministerial Council. I plan to attend the next such meeting scheduled for Armagh later this month.As regards the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), it has been agreed that this will transfer to the new Department and this will take place later this year once the necessary legislative basis is in place. In the meantime on an administrative basis, IYJS staff have been coming to departmental management meetings and structures are being established to facilitate their integration into the work of the Department.  I should say that the Director General of the OMCYA has for a number of years chaired the Irish Youth Justice Oversight Committee which brings together people from a number of organisations and which has proved an effective way of managing some of the cross cutting issues that arise.

The immediate and the ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) relating to accommodation, medical and social needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991. Where children are identified by An Garda Síochána, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.The Implementation Plan on the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009, contained a commitment that the HSE would end the use of separately run hostels for separated children seeking asylum and accommodate children in mainstream care, on a par with other children in the care system. In accordance with this commitment, the HSE phased out hostel type care for separated children seeking asylum and since January 2011, hostels have  not been used  to accommodate unaccompanied minors. Instead each child is cared for in a registered care placement or equivalent.  The HSE has developed a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis-à-vis indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.In response to the escalation in the numbers of separated children going missing, the HSE has worked extremely closely with An Garda Síochána to introduce new measures. This has included close supervision of those at risk of going missing based upon previously established profiles. As a result, whereas 47 separated children went missing in 2009 (with 9 subsequently traced), in 2010, 12 separated children went missing (with 5 subsequently accounted for). The HSE and An Garda Síochána continue to intensify joint efforts to prevent  separated children going missing from care and to respond jointly where this does occur.

The need for such legislation was also highlighted in the Implementation Plan prepared following the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. My Department has made much progress on this in recent weeks.  I will be publishing, later this week, new Children First national guidance. I also hope to be in a position very shortly to outline the details of the proposed legislation, including the requirements attaching to the various agencies with regard to implementation.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The National Children's Strategy Implementation Group last met on 9th June 2011. Its next meeting is scheduled to take place on 15th September 2011.  Members of the group are drawn from government departments and statutory agencies with responsibilities for the provision of services that support children and their development. It also includes representatives of An Garda Síochána and a number of local authorities. I have arranged for full details of the twenty plus member group to be provided to the Deputy.The National Children's Strategy Implementation Group has an important role to support the implementation of the national children's strategy to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.  The group's work plan for 2011 prioritises supports for the development of the children's services committees throughout the country to ensure quality integrated service delivery for children and young people. There are now 10 local children's services committees in place with an additional 5 at the preparatory stage.  It is planned to have 20 committees in place by the end of 2012.  Promoting evidence based practice is also a priority focus in the group's approach to developing the local committees. The 3 year strategic plan for the Working Together for Children initiative guides the National Children’s Strategy Implementation Group’s work plans and is available on www.dcya.gov.ie.I plan to meet the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group at an early date in the context of my plans for the new national children's strategy. I have asked my officials to make the necessary arrangements in consultation with the group.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Question Nos. 35, 63 and 64 together.A National Strategy for Youth Homelessness was developed in 2001. A review of progress in 2008 by the HSE in conjunction with other agencies found that significant progress had been made, especially in inter-agency cooperation, early prevention and an ‘out of hours' service. A standardised system is in place whereby Gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991. The service is designed to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety, thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting.  In addition, a pilot out-of-hours social work service is being tested in two locations as provided for in the Implementation Plan published following the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.It is acknowledged that there remain serious information deficits with regard to the number of children accessing services. Work is underway to improve the quality of information on the number of young people under 18 years who are homeless, and to establish what areas of the service are working well and where further improvements are needed.  Youth Homelessness has been identified as a priority for 2011 and my Department recently met with service providers and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assess and review the current demand for services, the progress made to date under the Strategy and the need to address any outstanding service deficits. This work will continue over the next few months.It is well recognised that young people leaving care, particularly those from residential care, are vulnerable to homelessness and the provision of an appropriate aftercare service is a vital element in seeking to achieve positive outcomes for young people leaving care.  Our legal advice is that further legislation is not required to give children a statutory right to aftercare, as the obligation contained in Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act 1991 is in substance mandatory.  The  Act creates a statutory power and the HSE, as recipient of this power, must put itself in a position where it can exercise the power should the need arise.In recognition of its statutory responsibilities, the HSE  National After Care Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document and  is being rolled out nationally under the watch of the HSE's  Aftercare Implementation Group.  This policy was developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders including the voluntary sector agencies and my Department and it sets out the rationale for the service, the principles upon which it is based and the key elements of the service. It commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people.The HSE policy recognises that Section 45 of the Childcare Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a "need for assistance" and if it forms such a view to provide services in accordance with the section and its resources. The policy states that all young people who have had a care history with the HSE — be it foster care, residential care or high support — are entitled to an Aftercare Service based on their assessed needs.Aftercare Services provided within the HSE  to young people who are preparing to leave or who have left the care of the H.S.E. will be developed in consultation with the young person, his/her family, carer, child and family social worker, link worker, and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies. The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to 21 years which can extend until the completion of a course of education in which he/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years.

Government colleagues obviously have particular responsibilities in relation to special needs: for example the Minister for Education and Skills in relation to education, the Minister for Health in the provision of health supports and the Minister for Transport in arranging for the provision of accessible transport services. The decision to establish a dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs reflects this Government's wish to achieve an overall policy framework which is in the interests of children.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	577	The National Children's Strategy, Our Children — Their Lives, which was published in November 2000, was Ireland’s first children’s strategy.  The goals of the strategy, that children will have a voice in matters which affect them, that their lives will be better understood and that they will receive quality supports and services to promote all aspects of their development, will inform the development of the new strategy for the period from 2012 to 2017.  In April of this year I launched a nationwide consultation process with children and young people. Its purpose was to ask children and young people about what is good, what is not good and what they would change about being a child or young person in Ireland today. Their views have an important contribution to make to the new strategy.The challenges facing children and their families today are very different to those that existed when the National Children's Strategy, Our Children — Their Lives,   was published. There are a number of new and emerging issues such as childhood obesity, trends in child poverty and consumerism, which are impacting upon children’s lives today. The development of the new strategy provides an opportunity to focus on these issues and how they may be addressed to improve the experience of childhood for this and future generations of children.  It is planned that the new children’s strategy will be published in mid 2012.My Department is also currently developing a new Youth Policy Framework. The specific aims of the Policy Framework are to:Articulate the policy objectives of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to youth;Enhance the development, participation and support of young people in the 10 — 24 year age range;Provide greater co-ordination and coherence in youth service provision and related services for young people.Preparation of this new policy framework will, of course, link closely with the drafting of a new National Children's Strategy. It is envisaged that the new policy framework will also be published in 2012.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I was concerned by the reported lack of co-operation with the work of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church (NBSCCC), as indicated in the Board's 2010 Report. I was particularly concerned by reports of data protection difficulties which were giving rise to a delay in progressing the national review of safeguarding practices in the Church being undertaken by the NBSCCC.In this context I wrote to the Data Protection Commissioner, seeking his advices as to whether any ongoing data protection concerns existed which might delay the progress of the work of the Board. The Data Protection Commissioner has advised me that his Office met on a number of occasions with representatives of the NBSCCC and the Church bodies and that mechanisms were identified by which the NBSCCC could access data held by dioceses and religious communities. The Commissioner was of the view that these engagements had addressed concerns that the NBSCCC's work could proceed in a manner that did not breach the rights of individuals under Data Protection legislation.I have written to the NBSCCC outlining the response of the Commissioner and I would hope that there are no outstanding issues which will inhibit the flow of information to the Board.  The Health Service Executive, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection matters, has separately been conducting a national audit of all Catholic dioceses and expects to furnish a report to me in the Autumn.It is the responsibility of all organisations who work with children to implement appropriate child protection policies and procedures. There can be no exceptions to this requirement and every organisation must satisfy itself and the public that its policies are in conformity with Children First and are consistently implemented in all cases.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk. The service is provided in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS) and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS).  The CIS provides an out-of-hours emergency  social work service to young people aged under 18 years who are in crisis. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardaí, hospital and ambulance service personnel.Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an EPSS whereby Gardaí can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out of hours. This service involves the out of hours placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case. As part of this service Gardaí have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.The HSE National Service Plan for 2011 includes a commitment to pilot and evaluate an out-of-hours social work component to supplement the EPSS. Two pilot projects are being undertaken, one in Cork and the other in Donegal. The projects involve the provision by local HSE staff of on-site social work support out of hours where deemed necessary by Gardaí.  A decision on progression to a national roll out will be made following evaluation of the two pilot projects and other relevant data.  An assessment of the cost of developing the service nationally will also be informed by the pilot process.

They are always appointed where a child is subject to Special Care proceedings.  There is a commitment in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, to engage with my colleagues to agree a future policy management and funding of the service.  My Department has had preliminary discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence in relation to this matter with a view, in particular to improving the quality, consistency and cost effectiveness of the current service.

Consultations have taken place with my Department and other Departments / agencies as part of the preparation of this legislation and these consultations are ongoing.  The National Vetting Bureau Bill will provide a statutory basis for the vetting of all applicants for employment and employees working with children. The Bill will provide for a vetting process which will provide for the identification of both hard and ‘soft/ relevant information', in particular, information relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse, or risk thereof, to children. This area has also been considered by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment for Children and the findings of the Committee are being considered in the preparation of the legislation.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Report) was published in May 2009. The Report served to highlight the need to strengthen the organisation and delivery of child welfare and protection services nationally.  Following the publication of the Report a detailed Implementation Plan was prepared and published in July 2009. The Plan sets out a series of 99 actions designed to address the effects of past abuse, reform  and strengthen service provision and ensure that children and young people have a stronger voice.Implementation of the Plan is being overseen by a high level group which I personally chair. The group includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), the Department of Education and Skills and An Garda Síochána. I also recently invited the Children's Rights Alliance to join the group. It is my intention to lay the second annual  progress report before the Oireachtas shortly.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	584	Under the child Care Act 1991 children should, in the first instance, be supported to remain with their families. Children should only be taken into care where the HSE has identified abuse or the risk of abuse, including neglect that cannot be prevented or resolved without the child being received into care.  My officials have met with officials of the Department of Social Protection to identify if there are any cases in which children enter the care system due to financial need rather than cases of abuse or the risk of abuse.  Where any such cases are identified, my officials will work with the Department of Social Protection and the HSE to ensure that children are only received into care on the basis of risk to their safety and welfare that cannot be alleviated by financial support alone.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Pre-school services are regulated currently under Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Under the regulations, the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) carry out inspections of pre-school services with the objective of securing the health, safety and welfare of children attending them.The scope of the existing Child Care Regulations is limited to pre-school children and does not include after-school services.  I believe the position in regard to after-school care services needs to be examined so that consideration can be given to introducing appropriate regulatory controls.  In addition, I believe the introduction of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which is implemented by my Department, is a very significant development for pre-school services which should be taken into account when a review of the Child Care Regulations is undertaken.Arrangements are already in train between officials in my Department and the Department of Education and Science and the HSE, for an evaluation of ECCE services to be carried out later this year.  The evaluation would involve the Education Inspectorate, possibly in conjunction with the HSE Inspectorate.  This will assist the general review of the regulatory environment and inspection process for pre-school and after-school services which I expect will be undertaken towards the end of this year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The Government is committed to fundamental reform and transformation of the delivery of our children and family services.  A number of significant structural and legislative changes are key to effecting such reform.  This includes the establishment of a new agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE and reporting directly to my Department through its Chief Executive.Preliminary work on the establishment of the new agency has been undertaken and this will now be accelerated.  I recently had a very positive meeting with the National Director and senior management representatives from the HSE at which the establishment of the new agency was discussed. It is my intention to develop an inclusive and collaborative approach in establishing the new agency and I intend to consult as widely as possible on its formation.Among the key issues which are being progressed are the legislative and governance arrangements necessary to underpin the establishment and operation of the agency.  My Department is also working closely with the National Director for Children and Families Service within the HSE on associated matters, including the need to disaggregate the existing resource base for children and family services from the HSE in advance of the establishment of the agency.   I am very appreciative of the co-operation from the HSE to date in progressing this significant change project, one which will, in my view, create the basis for delivering better outcomes for children and families nationally.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	587	My Department is continuing to work closely with the Department of Health on a range of issues including the monitoring of employment control issues relating to the provision of children and family services by the HSE under the National Service Plan. The HSE compiles a census of health employment in the public sector. This census is currently produced on a monthly basis and the latest data available is for May 2011. The employment census for May 2011 indicates a total of 2,447 whole time equivalent social workers, including those working directly with children and family services, broken down as follows:TotalSocial worker:1,321Social Worker (Medical)122Social Worker (non-professionally qualified)43Social Worker, Principal228Social Worker, Psychiatric32Social Worker, Psychiatric Senior1Social Worker, Senior Medical167Social Worker, Team Leader394Social Work Practitioner.

On taking office I instructed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) to work with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the Joint Committee, than that which the previous Government approved in draft form.Accordingly the preparation of a draft wording is being undertaken by Parliamentary Counsel in association with the Advisory Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and Officials in my Department. I would hope to be in a position  to submit the outcome of this work to Government for approval in the Autumn. It is envisaged that Government will be asked to approve the drafting of  a bill based on the wording submitted and to request the approval of the Oireachtas for the holding of a Constitutional referendum. I look forward to the debate among political and civic leaders and the wider public about the place of children within our society further raising societal awareness of the interests of children.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Report into the Roscommon case was published by the HSE on 27th October 2010. Since its publication my Department has sought and received assurances from the HSE that practice in assessing and responding to child welfare and protection concerns is being applied to the necessary standard across all regions. The HSE have already stated that they are committed to learning from this and other reports to ensure that services are strengthened to help protect children to the greatest extent possible.In relation to the specific family case the management of the case was transferred to Mayo ISA in January 2011 and the monitoring and oversight role is undertaken by the HSE Regional Lead for Childcare. Child in Care Reviews on all the children have been undertaken and chaired by the Regional Lead.  The local Management Team in Roscommon is leading out on implementation of recommendations and  monitoring and supporting the process. An external consultant  has provided training across disciplines on working with neglect, gender issues attachment and supervision.Nationally Workshops were convened to share the learning from the Roscommon Inquiry with specific focus on the Recommendations of that Enquiry.  The Workshops had a multidisciplinary focus and a Practice Guidance Document, ‘Back to Basics'  as disseminated which documented  key messages with accompanying guidance.One of the Recommendations from the Inquiry was for a National Audit of Neglect Cases to be completed, commencing with Roscommon. An external consultant has completed a Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect in Roscommon, and has highlighted both strengths and challenges. Positive outcomes included:Well established multidisciplinary arrangements and organisational structures which facilitated team work and communicationInitial assessments routinely completedAn emphasis on direct work with children and young persons and commitment to listening to children and ensuring their voices were heardThe Review found that in a majority of the cases, staff and managers displayed a commitment to early assessment of need and provided a range of supports to assist children and families, resulting in improved parenting capacity and better outcomes for children.  The Review concluded that the challenges involved are similar throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom including the need for more authoritative social work, senior managers reviewing and auditing files, national supervision policy implementation and establishing thresholds for legal intervention in cases.A Review of Progress following Audit was undertaken after three months and again this had many positive outcomes.  Achievements included:
The recommendations of the Inquiry Report and the Review of Practice and Management of Neglect are being implemented via an Interdisciplinary Child Care Steering group.A monthly child care meeting chaired by the General Manager considers specific developments within the Child Care Service, including budgetary and resourcing issues, waiting lists and individual cases which require to be notified to senior management.Family Support Services have been streamlined to include a single point of entry  and is being realigned with new social work boundaries.Revised management structures have been put in place in Child care Services in Roscommon and 5 additional social work posts were allocated  to Roscommon in 2010 and  a further 3 will be in 2011 to deal with an increase in referrals.Disciplinary Process:In relation to disciplinary action that may be taken by the HSE, such matters are governed by employee-employer confidentiality  and as such no information can be disclosed.

The National Recovery Plan 2011 to 2014 includes a range of measures which impact on every sector of the public service. The decision to remove the VTST is just one of these measures and while this decision will unquestionably lead to significant challenges for schools as well as other services the decision will not be reversed.  As part of the development of the Integrated Service, the NEWB will be required to adapt its remaining support services to include a renewed focus on supporting all children at risk including Traveller children.

The need for such legislation was also highlighted in the Implementation Plan prepared following the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. My Department has made much progress on this in recent weeks.  I will be publishing, later this week, new Children First national guidance. I also hope to be in a position very shortly to outline the details of the proposed legislation, including the requirements attaching to the various agencies with regard to implementation.It is my view that the new legislation needs to extend beyond the reporting of suspected abuse.  We also need to emphasise the importance of multi-disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns. Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure the safeguarding of children.I am attaching a particular importance to the need for this legislation and I would hope that the proposals which I will announce in this regard enjoy widespread support in the interests of protecting vulnerable children.  I would hope that the implementation of both the revised Children First Guidance and the legislation which will underpin compliance will provide an opportunity to raise societal awareness of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and the need for everyone to play their part in protecting children.  Since taking up office I have had the opportunity to meet and hold discussions with a wide range of representative groups on child welfare and protection issues.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I am aware that children and teenagers are susceptible to bullying which can emanate from a variety of sources. An unacceptably high proportion of children have been the subject of some form of bullying.  According to the 2008 survey "Growing Up In Ireland" the most common form of bullying identified by children who were victims was verbal bullying, followed by exclusion and physical bullying.Bullying by written messages and electronic means was less prominent at the time, but we are all aware that our children are very susceptible to the use of electronic media for bullying purposes, as use of this media, particularly for social networking, continues to grow. A Guide to Cyber Bullying was published at the end of 2008. This was a joint initiative between the Office for Internet Safety, the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), O2 and Barnardos. The NCTE also developed the website http://www.webwise.ie/  which provides information and resources to teachers, parents and students to help ensure that children’s online experiences are positive and safe.In relation to bullying in schools the Department of Education and Skills deals with regulations and guidelines on this issue. It is my understanding that the individual Board of Management of the school is the body responsible for the governance of the school, including responsibility for implementing effective policies to counter bullying. Any complaint of bullying should in the first instance be made to the Chairperson of the Board of Management. The Department of Education and Skills may subsequently become involved should it be necessary to review the handling of the complaint by the Board of Management.My Department provided funding in 2010 towards "Addressing Homophobia — Guidelines for the Youth Sector In Ireland", developed by the BeLonG To Youth Service. This is an important resource to help raise awareness of homophobia and to support the youth sector in preventing and addressing homophobic bullying.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	597	As the Deputy may be aware, no specific dedicated funding stream was allocated for the implementation of the National Recreation Policy for young people. The policy was intended to encourage relevant stakeholders and statutory agencies (such as Government Departments and Local Authorities etc) to examine existing recreation opportunities for young people and to maximise use of available funds to deliver improved and  more coordinated targeted recreational opportunities for them. Given the tight fiscal conditions which Departments and Local Authorities have been operating in and which is likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future, the approach being taken to date has been to allocate funding for the implementation of specific aspects of the policy which have been prioritised.I am happy to report that specific elements of the recreational policy were prioritised for implementation by my own Department (formerly OMCYA) in 2010/11 with funding approaching €1.6m in total being allocated for two specific initiatives, the nationwide Youth Café Funding Scheme and National Recreation Week. This targeted funding approach has ensured the successful implementation of important aspects of the policy in times where large scale funding is unavailable. I hope to build on that progress once the specific budgetary priorities for my Department have been finalised.In terms of specific achievements to date in 2010/11 a total of €1.5m was allocated from dormant accounts funds for the provision of a dedicated youth café funding scheme. The provision of such so called ‘hang out' recreation spaces was among the issues prioritised by young people themselves in consistent research which informed the recreation policy. A further €100,000 was allocated in various grants to local authorities and community groups to improve participation in the National Recreation week initiative. The event which takes place in October each year has grown in popularity in the past few years particularly with over two thirds of local authorities now arranging events consisting of a variety of sporting and culturally based activities.I intend to explore with my officials what relevant next steps need to be taken to ensure that the remaining local authorities actively participate in such initiatives and indeed prioritise recreational opportunities for young people in their business plans. Particular attention must be paid to improving the provision of information on local authority websites which often do not adequately promote the many excellent opportunities and existing local recreational facilities available.Much of the impetus for change in terms of the demands of the public for recreational facilities for young people falls on local authorities to deliver. They have been hugely effective in the success of the national recreation week initiative working in partnership with my Department. I intend to continue that partnership approach in the coming years. I will be writing to all City/County managers in the coming months to determine the exact level of spending from their budgets on play & recreation facilities for young people. I will be encouraging the prioritisation of the better provision of information and more effective promotion of the existing facilities in their own local areas particularly through better use of the network of local authority websites.My Department will encourage the setting up of a formal network of officials within local authorities with responsibilities in this area next year ultimately operating (it is hoped) independently. This will enable best practice, information sharing and even possible resource sharing among statutory agencies to deliver the best value for money in meeting the public's demands for high standard recreational facilities. Many local areas already have an impressive array of facilities but the public are often unaware of what is available. This information deficit must be addressed.Due to the severe economic constraints it will continue to be necessary to prioritise elements of recreation policy in terms of my Department's priorities with a view to achieving targeted outcomes which ensure value for money and the best outcomes for young people and families generally.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The main funding mechanisms for youth cafés in recent years have been provided by the Government under 2 separate strands, the YPFSF (Young People's Facilities and Services Fund) and the competitive 2010 OMCYA / POBAL youth café funding scheme. Under the YPFSF a number of facilities funded have a multi-purpose usage. This responds to the needs of the local communities, the existing projects and services and links in with the development and accommodation of a range of new services. Most of the purpose built YPFSF youth facilities provide a safe space or youth café for young people to drop in. Capital funding of over €13 million has been provided to date under the YPFSF for 15 facilities which incorporated a youth café element in their design.The dedicated competitive OMCYA/POBAL youth café funding scheme last year awarded a total of €1.5m to create a network of 16 new youth cafés across the State. A percentage of that fund, approximately 25%, was awarded to refurbish and re-equip a total of 50 existing youth cafés across the country. The new sites funded under both funding schemes are gradually coming on stream and indeed I had the pleasure myself of officially opening 2 brand new youth cafés in Dundalk and Dublin respectively in the past few weeks. It is expected that the remaining sites will open over the next 12 to 18 months. My Department estimates that there are approximately 75 to 100 youth cafés currently operating across the country. This represents a significant step forward in terms of the provision of safe meeting spaces for young people in a relatively short period of time. This is a direct result of targeted implementation of specific aspects of the national recreation policy.I understand that the Attic Youth Café in Co. Longford is a vibrant and well operated project and that they competed for funds under the then OMCYA/POBAL funding scheme.  Due to the highly competitive nature of that scheme they were among those not successful in obtaining funds on that occasion. My Department has no immediate plans for additional new funding schemes targeting youth cafés this year, as a significant amount of money has been allocated to various projects. I will consider in due course whether any further funding can be allocated to this area  having regard to the overall budget priorities of my Department and in the context of the constraints on public spending generally at the present time.In the meantime I would suggest that the group consider applying for funding under the Local Youth Grant Scheme administered by the local VECs and also via the National Lottery allocation scheme for my Department. I would need to advise the Deputy that demand for Departmental lottery funding is very competitive therefore no guarantee of a successful outcome can be given. I wish the project every success with their future work. My officials will be happy to assist with information on both schemes.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	599	Special Care involves the detention on an exceptional basis of a non-offending child for his or her own welfare and protection in a Special Care unit with on site educational and therapeutic supports. The child's behaviour, and the risk of harm it poses to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare is addressed in the care setting. Future care requirements are also explored.There are three designated Special Care units in the country which are operated by the HSE under a single national governance arrangement. They are Ballydowd Young Peoples Centre (Dublin), Glean Alainn (Cork) and Coovagh House (Limerick).  The placing of a child in a Special Care unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.The number of Special Care places available in 2010 was reduced following HIQA inspections and recommendations regarding standards of management staffing and building maintenance. A combination of a shortage of places and particular specialised needs has led the HSE to placing a number of children abroad, most notably in a secure unit in Kibble in Scotland. Currently there are three children placed there, with five/six referrals being considered.The HSE is committed to the provision of National High Support and Special Care Services of the highest quality. The HSE National High Support and Special Care Services consist of:Three special care units in Ireland; Ballydowd in Dublin, Glenn Álainn in Cork and Coovagh House in Limerick, which provide a capacity of 17  + 4 emergency places and,Two national High Support Units at Crannog Nua, Portrane in north County Dublin and Rath na nÓg in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan providing 16 places.These services provide individualised programme of support for children and young people with exceptional needs through the provision of a time-limited, therapeutic intervention in a secure and non-secure environment. Ballydowd has recently undergone major refurbishment works.  In line with the requirement for the integration of these services within the wider Children & Families Social Services structure a decision was taken by HSE in July, 2010 to transfer the operation management of HSE National High Support and Special Care Services to the Regional Director of Operations Dublin North East.The HSE are establishing a National Therapy Service for Special Care Units and Children Detention Centres.  The service will be called ACTS — National Assessment Consultation & Therapy Service.  The service will cover the four RDO Regions and report in to DNE for operational management purposes.  Following a consultation process a service proposal was signed off by the HSE in October 2010 and recruitment is currently in progress.  The proposal recommends developing a four-pronged model comprising:1. A national assessment and intervention service for children at risk.2. On-site therapeutic services for high support and special care units.3. On-site therapeutic services for the children detention schools.4. A parallel development of a forensic child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) for children and young people with significant mental health needs requiring more specialist input.When fully in place this key national service will ensure all children placed in secure care, whether on welfare or offending grounds, will have access to specialist clinical interventions in line with their assessed individual needs.The overall objective of the HSE National High Support and Special Care Services is the provision of individualised services responses, within the framework of national policy and within a continuum of services through a single point of referral for children.  The HSE is engaging with HSE National High Support and Special Care Services to progress a huge programme of work and plans for significant infrastructural and team development which will increase the total of special care unit places to 27 (+ 7 emergency).With regards to high support, it is envisaged the HSE will maximize the use of existing provision and further develop ‘high support as a methodology' to provide community-based responses for those with high support needs.  Components will include:Outreach and Wilderness services as part of an ‘integrated model'Development of specialist and/or high support fosteringThe development of specialist national Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Services and improvements in pathways to access the services of other disciplines and agencies.Access to suitable aftercare accommodation and supports.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	600	"The Agenda for Children's Services" was published by the OMCYA in December, 2007.  The core principle of the policy is the provision of health and social services, based on the child being supported within the family and within the local community.  Launched in and with the document is a series of Reflective Questions for policy-makers, HSE Senior managers and front-line managers and practitioners.  These questions assist people working in any part of the children's health and social services system, to check and possibly change the way they work.  The questions also assist individuals to understand where their own work fits into the wider system and to ensure that their work is effectively linked with that of other stakeholders, in delivering better outcomes for children and families.The Ryan Implementation Plan 2009, action 21 stated that all agencies that provide services to children should develop and implement an operational plan based on The Agenda for Children's Services.  The HSE has committed to implementing this policy as part of ongoing business arrangements, and has committed that it is part of service level agreements with commissioned services.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I will launch Listen to Our Voices! Hearing Children and Young People Living in the Care of the State in Ireland on Wednesday, 27th July 2011.  From January to December 2010, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) conducted a consultation process with children living in the care of the State. 211 children and young people took part in the consultations. The participants ranged in age from 8 years to young people who have left the care system and are over 18.  Fifteen consultations were held in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Sligo. A separate parallel process for young people with moderate to severe disabilities was also conducted in Dublin, Meath and Galway.The consultations were run in an informal, open and safe manner. Creative methodologies and tools were devised to enable children and young people to express their views. These tools included lifelines, body maps, workshops and feedback sessions, as well as a variety of voting mechanisms where young people had the opportunity to identify their priority issues. Arts and crafts-based activities were used for the younger age groups and with young people with intellectual disabilities.  A Youth Advisory Group (YAG) made up of young people from a variety of care settings was established to advise on the consultation methodology, sit on the Consultation Oversight Committee and attend the consultations.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I have met with my colleague Ms Kathleen Lynch TD Minister for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People and we have discussed a range of issues including children's mental health.  The Mental Health Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 which outlines arrangements and facilities that should be put in place to ensure the protection and safety of such children.  The code provides that no child:under 16 years is to be admitted to an adult unit from 1st July 2009;under 17 years is to be admitted to an adult unit from 1st December 2010; andunder 18 years is to be admitted to an adult unit from 1st December 2011.If, in exceptional circumstances, the admission of a child to an adult unit occurs, the approved centre is obliged to submit a detailed report to the Commission outlining why the admission has taken place.  The Commission reviews any such notifications received and follows up as deemed appropriate.  It is accepted that it is inappropriate to admit young people to units providing care and treatment to adults, however such admissions are sometimes necessary for the safety and treatment of the child.  In arriving at a decision to admit a young person to an adult unit, due consideration is given to the risks of not admitting him/her, and the potential adverse effects of such an admission.The HSE has prioritised the development of mental health services for children and adolescents.  Bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 52 at present, and further developments are planned which will bring capacity to 66 by 2012.A child should only be admitted as in-patient (to any psychiatric facility) as a last resort and should as far as possible receive the necessary treatment in the community — there are now 61 multidisciplinary Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams nationally and further teams will be developed.  The new Government  is committed to reforming our model of healthcare delivery so that more care is delivered in the community; access to modern mental health services in the community will therefore be significantly improved.  It is proposed to ringfence €35m annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services for both adults and children.  It is envisaged that the provision of improved community based services, coupled with an increase in bed capacity, will put an end to the practice of placing children and adolescents in adult psychiatric facilities.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The Programme for Government 2011 states that the referendum on Children's Rights is a priority, and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the All Party Oireachtas Committee. On taking office I instructed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) to work with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the Joint Committee, than that which the previous Government approved in draft form.Accordingly the preparation of a draft wording is being undertaken by Parliamentary Counsel in association with the Advisory Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and officials in my Department. I would hope to be in a position  to submit the outcome of this work to Government for approval in the Autumn. It is envisaged that Government will be asked to approve the drafting of  a bill based on the wording submitted and to request the approval of the Oireachtas for the holding of a Constitutional referendum. I look forward, in particular, to the debate among political and civic leaders and the wider public about the place of children within our society further raising awareness of the interests of children.

The system maintains information about children in respect of the whom the HSE is satisfied that there are unresolved child protection issues, including neglect. The function of the system will be clearly set out in the new Children First National Guidance for the protection and welfare of children which I will be publishing later this week.  The HSE has advised that it has no plans to introduce an alternative system for the recording of such information.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	605	As the Deputy will be aware, from my answers to his Parliamentary Question no. 105 on 5 July 2011 and Parliamentary Question no. 72 on 28 June 2011, the Export Trade Council, which will be established shortly and which I will chair, will consider the overall programme of trade missions. It will also monitor implementation of the Government's Trade Strategy under which Japan and China have been identified as priority markets.The Ambassadors in Tokyo and Beijing chair local market teams which bring together the relevant State Agencies focussed on developing further our trading and investment links in those countries. Ireland's trade with China is developing strongly — exports to China in 2010 increased by 7.5% on the previous year. Exports to China from the indigenous Irish enterprise sector have increased by 66% since 2007 until 2010. In the last six years, the number of Irish companies who have established permanent presences in China has increased from some 40 to 127. Japan was Ireland's 11th largest merchandise trading partner in 2010, with total merchandise trade that year worth €2.5bn and trade in services in 2009 valued at €1.3bn. Furthermore over 40 Japanese companies have a presence in Ireland employing over 2,500 people.The Government attaches great importance to developing our trade and economic links with all of our Asian partners. In this context, I hope to attend the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum (APIBF) in Seoul, Korea on 14 October 2011.  While it will not be possible to schedule a full trade mission to Japan before the end of 2011, I hope to visit Tokyo en route to the APIBF meeting and to have a number of meetings there focussed on trade and economic issues.The Taoiseach hopes to lead a Trade Mission to China later this year and contact is continuing, including through our Embassy in Beijing, to arrange mutually acceptable dates.  China is also one of a number of countries with which Ireland has a Joint Economic Commission.  The last meeting of the JEC took place in Beijing last October and provided an opportunity for intensive bilateral discussions on a range of issues that have the potential to deepen our economic engagement.  The next meeting of the JEC with China is due to take place in Dublin in 2012.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The number of applications received so far this year shows an increase in demand of 12% in comparison to this time in 2009.  The figures for 2010 are not a reliable comparison due to the impact of last year's industrial action.  Whereas the exact reason for this increase in demand is unclear it is noticeable that passport applications for children and passports for the over 65s have been higher than during the same period in the last few years.  Discussions with customers have also suggested that much of the demand relates to last minute travel plans made for holiday reasons.In addition, changes to passport application procedures were introduced in January requiring first time adult applicants and those reporting passports lost or stolen to submit additional documentary evidence to establish identity and entitlement to an Irish passport.  These changes were a necessary response to an increase in the number of fraudulently obtained passports and the need to protect the integrity and international reputation of the Irish passport.  Whereas these new measures have had some impact on the time to process applications, the impact primarily relates to only a small subset of the overall application demand.It is currently taking up to fifteen working days to process applications submitted through Passport Express. This represents a delay of five working days over the normal guaranteed turnaround.  Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website www.passport.ie.  The Passport Office has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application.  Priority will continue to be given to applications made through the Passport Express Service and Irish-based customers are strongly encouraged to use that service.  It is regrettable that, due to the high number of applications, those submitted through other channels i.e. through the ordinary post system or from Ireland’s overseas Missions etc. are currently taking considerably longer to be processed.There are currently 48,242 passport applications in the system being processed across the Passport Offices in Molesworth Street, Balbriggan, Cork and London.  An average of 3,400 applications per day were received last week which is down from the recent previous average of over 4,000 applications per day.  This reduction provides some evidence that passport demand is beginning to level off, in which case, it is expected that the number of applications in the system will decrease over the coming weeks.However this reduction is still not reflected in the unprecedented demand for passports at short notice.  The Passport Service is currently receiving 400 people per day on average coming to the public office seeking passports within a period of less than 10 days.  On 6 July, over 440 people submitted applications for a short notice service at the public office in Molesworth Street alone.  In the context of these very large numbers of customers using the public counter service, it is not always possible, despite the best efforts of the Passport Office staff, to be of assistance and to accommodate all requests for a short notice service.  Citizens are advised that the public counter services should only be used in cases of genuine emergency.  Priority at the public counters will be given to those who have a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency i.e. travel is necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member.It should also be stressed that to protect the integrity of the system and the quality of the passport, the Passport Service cannot provide standard passports within a single day.  The shortest turnaround time available is three working days for applications received over the public counter, accompanied by proof of travel, other than in cases of genuine emergency.From the beginning of April, my Department took on additional temporary staff to work in the Passport Service.  There are now 85 additional temporary staff in place, and they have been trained in passport processing.  In conjunction with seasonal overtime, I expect the Passport Service to be in a position to bring return times back to normal levels over the coming weeks.  I would once again express my regret at the delays being experienced by customers of the Passport Service and would strongly appeal to the public to assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports before making bookings to travel abroad.  A valid passport should be the first item on any check list when considering foreign travel.

I understand that the Indian National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, a statutory body, has demanded an investigation into the allegations and that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh has ordered such an inquiry.  I am also aware that several human rights organisations in India are active on the issue.  Officials from my Department and our Embassy in New Delhi will continue to monitor developments in this matter.Ireland is committed to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and is involved in a variety of initiatives at international level to this end, such as playing an active role in the negotiation and adoption of resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council aimed at promoting the rights of women and girls.  Furthermore, Ireland actively participates in the Commission on the Status of Women under the UN Economic and Social Council.  Ireland was to the fore in promoting the establishment of UN Women, the new UN agency working for gender equality and women's empowerment, and has provided over €1.8 million since its establishment earlier this year for its work in developing countries.Ireland acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 23 December 1985. Ireland signed and ratified the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 7 September 2000. As a State Party to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Ireland is committed to implementing the provisions of the Convention and ensuring the elimination of gender based discrimination.  India is also a party to CEDAW and ratified it on 25 June 1993.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.The Republic of South Sudan declared its independence on 9 July in accordance with the terms of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the results of the self-determination referendum held on 9 January 2011.  The EU was a witness signatory to the CPA and all EU Member States have agreed to recognise the Republic of South Sudan in accordance with their own domestic procedures.  Ireland, for its part, recognised the new state on 9 July following a Government decision taken on 5 July.However, there are a wide range of issues that have yet to be agreed between the parties including border demarcation, citizenship and oil revenues and the ongoing uncertainty over these issues is a serious concern.  The international community must remain engaged to find ways in which these issues can be resolved.  In this regard, we welcome the EU comprehensive approach on Sudan agreed at the recent Foreign Affairs Council as laying out the way forward on these issues.  I wish to also acknowledge the important role being played by the United Nations and its mission to Sudan, UNMIS, as well as the African Union and IGAD.  The establishment of normal relations between the Government of the Republic of Sudan and the Government of the Republic of South Sudan is also important in this regard.Continuing violence in Southern Kordufan and the resulting humanitarian crisis are a major concern. I welcome the recent agreement between the parties on political and security arrangements in Blue Nile and Southern Kordufan but call on them to conclude a cessation of hostilities agreement as a matter of urgency and to allow full humanitarian access. Only in such circumstances of peace and stability can the popular consultation processes envisaged in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement be agreed upon and conducted in a credible manner.  I also call on the Government of the Republic of Sudan and the Government of the Republic of South Sudan to respect the agreement on Abyei and to cooperate fully with the Ethiopian peacekeeping mission and the UN as it seeks to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground.The international community must remain engaged in seeking to promote human rights standards both in the Republic of Sudan and the new Republic of South Sudan.  Through membership of such organisations as the African Union, and the United Nations, the new State of the Republic of South Sudan will have to play its part in upholding these rights.  Ireland will engage with others internationally to help resolve the outstanding issues between Sudan and South Sudan, and will also seek to provide what assistance we can to the very vulnerable population of the new State. Ireland, through Irish Aid, provides considerable humanitarian assistance towards meeting the needs of the people of Sudan, north and south.  Since 2008, nearly €24 million has been provided specifically to the south, of a total of more than €50 million provided in humanitarian assistance to Sudan in general.  We also contribute to the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund, to which we have contributed €5 million this year.As regards future assistance, officials from my department visited South Sudan last month, holding political meetings, as well as an assessment team from Irish Aid to see what assistance we might be in a position to offer, as South Sudan is extremely undeveloped and will be in need of assistance for some years to come.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.Ireland has an excellent and long-standing relationship with Canada. Our trade links are particularly strong and growing. Canada is one of Ireland's top 20 trading partners with total trade over €1.5 billion.  There is good potential for this to grow with Irish exports to Canada increasing by almost 30% in 2010.  Canada has been identified as a high-potential market for Ireland under the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015.  The local market team set up under the Strategy and chaired by our Ambassador has developed a detailed market plan and is already active in pursuit of specific targets identified by the State Agencies.My Department works continually to develop our trade links with Canada and the Director General of the Trade and Promotion Division of my Department met recently with the Canadian Ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Loyola Hearn, in this regard.  I myself have had an exchange with Ambassador Hearn on the matter and I will be seeking an early opportunity to meet with my Canadian Ministerial counterpart to build on the existing strong bilateral economic relationship between our two countries.  I have asked my officials to explore the possibility of setting up an initial such meeting in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York in September.The Embassy of Ireland in Ottawa is very active in the promotion of Ireland's economic and trading interests with Canada and is also working to restore Ireland's international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis. Recent activity in this regard includes Embassy involvement in a Doing business in Ireland and the UK   seminar in Montreal and Embassy representation at 34 events throughout Canada over the St Patrick’s Day period. The Embassy also collaborated on the inaugural business summit organised in Toronto by the Ireland Canada Business Association. During a recent visit to Nova Scotia, the Ambassador met with a wide range of political and economic contacts in the province, many of whom expressed interest in collaboration, and increasing trade, with Ireland.Enterprise Ireland also has an office in Toronto and is represented on the local market team chaired by the Ambassador. The Enterprise Ireland Canada office works with companies from a variety of sectors including telecoms, government and financial software, consumer, life sciences and third level institutes. So far in 2011, Enterprise Ireland has worked with approximately 85 companies on an individual basis and its office has also hosted and managed five delegations of Irish companies that were invited to explore the market. This included Market Study Visits to the Canadian Gift and Tableware show and the National Heavy Machinery show, advisory sessions for software companies targeting financial services and a Trade Fair presence for third level institutes at the NAFSA, the biggest annual gathering of international educators and Study Abroad advisors in North America.

I believe that the scheme will provide a practical demonstration of the inclusive approach adopted by successive Governments to our diaspora.The Certificate of Irish Heritage will give official recognition to the many people worldwide who are conscious of their Irish heritage and feel a strong affinity for Ireland.  It will not, however, confer any citizenship or other legal rights or entitlements to the successful applicants.  Those applying for Certificates of Irish Heritage will be required to submit comprehensive details of their Irish ancestral connections and relevant documents and certificates to show their connection with Ireland.  Contract negotiations with FeXco the company selected to operate the service on behalf of my Department have now been completed. It is expected that the scheme will be operational by October.

That remains my position.  I also stated that a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman had indicated that the Turkish authorities did not consider that sabotage had taken place. Our Embassy in Ankara had been in contact with the local authorities in the port when the reports of damage to the Saoirse   were received.The local authorities concerned indicated that the persons who reported the damage gave it as their opinion that sabotage was involved.  However, the local coastguard considered that the damage to the vessel they were shown was likely to have resulted from a collision with an object at sea.  They expressed the view that it would be difficult for a person in the water to have inflicted damage of that type to a moored vessel, particularly without being detected by those on board or in the harbour.  They also noted that an intending saboteur could have disabled the propeller far more easily than by inflicting the type of damage incurred by the Saoirse.  I have no grounds on which to dispute these views or to demand a further investigation.

These are partners with substantial interaction in various fields with the Union, and the potential for further developing this. The EU has a natural, strong interest in promoting stability and in the spread of its values in the regions close to it. Ireland shares that interest and takes an active part in the Neighbourhood Policy and its implementation.The most recent development has been a strategic review of the European Neighbourhood Policy by the Commission and the EEAS following a mandate from the European Council. Ireland contributed to that review by way of a written response in November 2010.  In that response we emphasised the importance of differentiation between our partners, and of helping when asked, but also of being careful not to impose our own precepts.  We also supported a strong conditionality, rewarding greater engagement and reform efforts with greater funding and support.These ideas are well reflected in the Communication resulting from the review by the EEAS and Commission entitled "A new Approach to a changing Neighbourhood" which was published on 25 May 2011. The joint Communication was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June and I made the point that conditionality should be applied intelligently and that the EU should be respectful in its approach to our neighbours. The aim should be to support wherever we can, but not seek to impose solutions.  Conclusions were adopted by the Council broadly endorsing the new approach, and this was in turn endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 24 June.Neighbourhood Policy mobilises an array of actions in support for the modernisation of neighbouring countries through reforms in return for concessions from the EU, above all in the fields of trade and freedom of travel, with the stated aim of achieving long-term stability and prosperity in the neighbourhood. Actions involving civil society, the use of the financial aid of the Neighbourhood Instrument, sectoral cooperation, and participation in EU programmes all form part of the effort.The review and the subsequent new approach come at what has turned out to be a particularly sensitive time in terms of the Union's relations with our partners in the Southern Neighbourhood, with events of the Arab Spring making an effective and prompt EU response all the more relevant.  The current Polish Presidency of the Council is putting considerable emphasis on work under the Eastern Partnership. I support them in this and in the various sectoral and Foreign Ministerial meetings planned as well as the summit in Warsaw in late September.

It was also declared that at the time of the conclusion of the next accession Treaty the provisions of the Decision would be set out in a Protocol which would be attached to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  On 30 June, the accession negotiations with Croatia were formally concluded and it is expected that the Accession Treaty will be ready for signature at the December European Council. National ratifications would then follow, with the working assumption of accession taking effect on 1 July 2013.The procedures to effect the necessary Treaty change to take account of the Irish protocol are set out in Article 48 of the Treaty on the European Union. It is currently envisaged that the Government will submit to the General Affairs Council in October a proposal to amend the Treaties by annexing the proposed protocol to the Treaties.  This proposal will in turn be submitted by the Council to the European Council and national Parliaments shall be notified. The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, must then adopt a decision in favour of examining the proposed amendment.The amendment may then be examined by a Convention involving representatives of the national parliaments, of the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, of the European Parliament and of the Commission and, following a recommendation by the Convention, agreed by an Inter-Governmental Conference comprised of representatives of the Governments of the Member States. Alternatively, it may be possible to have the amendment agreed by an Inter-Governmental Conference directly, without convening a convention. The amendment would then enter into force after being ratified by all Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.At the European Council in October 2009, the Heads of State or Government also agreed that, at the time of the conclusion of the next Accession Treaty and in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements, they would attach a Protocol to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic. It is now, therefore, a matter for the Czech authorities to submit to the Council a proposal for the amendment of the Treaties in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty of the European Union in order to achieve this.

In summary, the VAT Act 1972 was amended to provide that public bodies, including local authorities, are made subject to VAT.  More specifically, they are subject to VAT where they engage (i) in economic activities; (ii) in any activities as outlined in Annex I of the EU VAT Directive, unless the activity is carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible; and (iii) in the case of their regulatory capacity as a public authority, when their treatment as non-taxable could lead to a distortion of competition.  These are subject of course to the activity not being otherwise exempted from VAT.During the debate on the Finance Bill, the then Minister for Finance undertook to look again at the provisions, in particular in relation to the supply of community and sports facilities by public bodies, especially local authorities.  The legislation was accordingly amended to provide that the new VAT rules for public bodies, in relation to the supply of sports and community-type facilities, will be commenced by order, rather than on 1 July 2010.  This was to allow for a more complete examination of the issues, including an analysis of how the new rules might best be implemented.  In the circumstances, I have no immediate plans to introduce such an Order.

The first stage of this assessment process is currently underway in the form of a public consultation. The consultation paper and details of how to make submissions are available on the Department of Finance's website. The consultation will run from 23 June to 29 July 2011.The purpose of this consultation is to provide an opportunity for all interested parties to offer input on how the impact assessment should proceed in determining an appropriate policy approach to the "legacy" reliefs, including Section 23 type reliefs.  The assessment will consider the economic impact of curtailing the costs to the State of outstanding or ‘legacy' reliefs, which have so far not been fully claimed by investors. It will enable us to better understand the benefits that may accrue to the Exchequer in terms of additional tax yield as well as consequences for investor groups and the wider economy arising from possible changes to the treatment of property-based legacy reliefs.  The results of the assessment will be considered in the context of Budget 2012.

Instead, a number of tools have been made available, through which an individual should be able to estimate an approximate liability.  Revenue valuation officials maintain a database of valuations of the more common makes, models, types and versions of vehicles imported into the State. This database contains over 20,000 valuations and can be accessed on the Revenue website at https://www.ros.ie/evrt-enquiry/vrtenquiry.html?execution=e1s1. Using this facility, an individual intending to purchase a used vehicle abroad, may input the specific criteria relating to a particular vehicle, i.e. age, mileage, condition, etc. and receive a valuation (including the VRT due) for that particular vehicle or a comparable model.If the vehicle is not available on the website, an individual can, using the methodology used by Revenue valuation officials, estimate the valuation of a vehicle. This methodology is available on Revenue's website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/vehicle-registration-tax/vrt-manual-section-8.pdf. Additionally, in order to help an individual to get as accurate an estimate as possible, a form was devised to guide them in the self-estimate process.  This form is available at http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/forms/vrt-pre-registration-self-estimate.pdf and uses the techniques used by Revenue valuation officers in determining the OMSP of a vehicle. It should if followed correctly, yield an accurate self-estimate of the value of the vehicle for VRT purposes.It should be noted that Section 132(1) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) provides for the charging of VRT. That section provides that: —"In addition to any other duty which may be chargeable, subject to the provisions of this Chapter and any regulations thereunder, with effect on and from the 1st day of January, 1993, a duty of excise, to be called vehicle registration tax, shall be charged, levied and paid at whichever of the rates specified in subsection (3) is appropriate on —(a) the registration of a vehicle, and(b) a declaration under section 131(3)."Accordingly, regardless of how accurate an estimate may be, the actual liability cannot be determined until such time as the vehicle is presented at an NCTS centre, where the actual valuation and VRT liability specific to that particular vehicle, will be determined by Revenue at the time of registration.

This information is provided in the NAMA Quarterly reports which are laid before the Oireachtas and published on the NAMA website on a quarterly basis.   At the end of Quarter 4 2010, NAMA reported a figure of 23% of the overall Portfolio as ‘performing'.NAMA advises that the performance status of a loan can change over its life depending on the means of the borrower to meet its obligations and the characteristics of the underlying asset. The performance status of the loans is unrelated to the acquisition discount. The discount is primarily based on the underlying value of the property which is the security for the loan. The performance status of the non-performing loans in the overall NAMA portfolio is also set out in the table.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provided for a second reduced VAT rate, of 9%, on a temporary basis in respect of certain services and goods for the period 1 July 2011 to end 2013.  Businesses must account for VAT at the 9% rate on these specified goods and services provided by them on or after 1 July 2011.  Where the goods and services are supplied to another VAT-registered business a VAT invoice must be issued, charging VAT at the new rate.  However, where the supplies are to unregistered customers there is no obligation to show the VAT separately.  Businesses dealing with unregistered customers are not legally obliged to reduce their (VAT-inclusive) pricing to reflect the post-1 July 2011 lower rate, but would be expected to do so.However, in reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, the introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  With this in mind, the VAT reduction will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.  In addition, checks on the correct operation of VAT, including the rates of VAT applied are integral parts of Revenue's audit and compliance programmes.

These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2011 incomes, of a 1% point increase in the top rate of income tax for those single and widowed individuals with incomes over €100,000 and married couples with incomes over €200,000 as referred to  by the Deputy would be of the order of  €59 million in a full year.  In addition, the cost of a 1% point increase in the top rate of income tax for those single and widowed individuals with incomes over €200,000 and married couples with incomes over €400,000 would be of the order of €30 million in a full year. These estimates are based on confining the increased tax rate to the segment of income that is in excess of the stated thresholds of €100,000, €200,000 and €400,000.These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.  It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.  The Deputy should be aware that increases in the income tax rates at the levels proposed would constitute a third rate of tax.  Given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such new rates could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The costs of the provision of certain free or subsidised childcare facilities by employers were exempt from a benefit-in-kind charge on the employees that availed of such facilities. This exemption was abolished in the recent Budget and Finance Bill 2011.  This relief was introduced in 1999 to encourage employers to invest in childcare facilities and thus increase the overall supply of childcare places. At the time of its introduction, there was a scarcity of childcare places and the costs associated with childcare were increasing. The aim of the exemption was to encourage employers who were not traditionally associated with the provision of childcare to provide such facilities for their employees.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity, due to the likelihood that only large employers have the ability to make the necessary investments.A number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.   These support measures include a free pre-school year in Early Childhood Care and Education, a five-year National Childcare Investment Programme which aims to fund an additional 25,000 childcare places by end 2011, as well as extended paid and unpaid maternity leave.  With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, there was no notification procedure for employers involved. Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have costs for the scheme. It was estimated in Budget 2011 that the abolition would yield €3 million to the Exchequer in 2011 and €6 million in a full year.

In my recent engagements with Troika senior officials I raised the issue of programme pricing.  I have also continued to do so at every suitable opportunity at EU level.  The Government is prepared to discuss changes that will not have a negative effect on our economy. However, the Government has consistently stated that it would not put Ireland's economic recovery in jeopardy through changes to the corporation tax rate, which is a significant factor in attracting the foreign direct investment that supports 250,000 jobs in Ireland.

VAT rates are not specific to business sectors, unless a sector deals in one particular good or service.  The goods and services to which the 9% VAT rate applies are those, and only those, listed in paragraphs 3(1) to (3), 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13(3) of Schedule 3 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.Examples of such goods and services supplied in the tourism industry are: the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol and soft drinks) in the course of catering; the supply, by means of a vending machine, of food and drink that would otherwise be zero-rated; hot take-away food and hot drinks; hotel lettings, including guesthouses, caravan parks, camping sites etc; admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums and art gallery exhibitions; amusement services of the kind normally supplied in fairgrounds or amusement parks; and the provision, by a person other than a non-profit making organisation, of facilities for taking part in sport.  The 9% rate also applies to printed matter, including newspapers, magazines, brochures, leaflets, programmes, maps, catalogues and printed music, and to hairdressing services.

Tax revenue in 2011 is estimated at €34.9 billion.

The April Stability Programme Update (SPU) projected total 2011 national debt servicing expenditure at some €6.2 billion, including €0.6 billion in national debt interest expenditure sourced from the Capital Services Redemption Account (CSRA).2 The outturn for total gross voted Government expenditure in 2010 is estimated at €60.5 billion. The February 2011 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) estimated total gross voted Government expenditure at €57.5 billion in 2011. A new REV for 2011, updated for the restructuring of Departmental responsibilities, the Jobs Initiative   and certain other minor technical adjustments, will be published shortly.3 In 2010, €30.85 billion was committed to be provided to Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) and Educational Building Society (EBS) by way of Promissory Note, the terms of which provide, inter alia, that 10 per cent shall be paid to the Note holder each year. The first such payments, amounting to €3.085 billion, were made to the institutions in the first half of 2011. However, there was no Exchequer expenditure associated with these Promissory Notes in 2010.In 2010 also, the Exchequer provided €625 million to EBS by way of a special investment share and €100 million to INBS by way of a special investment share. This method of investment gave the State extensive powers and full economic ownership of the two building societies.It should also be noted that in 2010, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) injected a further €3.7 billion in capital into AIB. As this injection was sourced from the NPRF, it did not impact on Exchequer spending in 2010. In addition, the recent banking stress tests carried out by the Central Bank identified an additional €24 billion in support to the banking sector as being required, including €3 billion of funds which take the form of contingent capital. However, it is anticipated that mitigating actions, such as burden sharing, will mean that up to €5 billion of this €24 billion will not have to be provided by the State, with €10 billion of the State's contribution being sourced from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the balance funded by the Exchequer.

All staff assigned to NAMA are NTMA employees.  The NTMA also provides NAMA with business and support services and systems.   The legislation which established the NTMA in 1990 deliberately positioned it outside of the wider public service structures with operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries so that it would have, for example, the flexibility to recruit specialists in mid-career from the private sector. Under the NTMA business model, its remuneration structure is such that there are no general pay grades and no pay scales and all staff are on individually-negotiated contracts.This business model has allowed the NTMA to staff itself with the necessary technical expertise to carry out the financial and risk management functions which have been assigned to it by Government since its initial establishment as a single-function agency managing the National Debt. These additional functions include the State Claims Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the National Development Finance Agency, the National Asset Management Agency and certain banking system functions of the Minister for Finance.

Similarly where the State has extensive shareholdings in other relevant covered institutions, this is important from the point of view of ensuring that their operations are managed, by their respective boards and management, on a commercial basis with a view to securing the maximum return for the taxpayer.  I do not, therefore, compile the detailed data sought by the Deputy on pay, or on the number of personnel on secondment from professional firms providing services to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS.  The latter would, in any event, be a matter that is primarily a professional and commercial matter for the particular firms providing the service.However, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and I have indicated, in answers to other questions today, that I am asking the institutions to compile data on staff numbers and remuneration practices and details with a view, as part of the remuneration review presently being conducted by the institutions at the request of my Department, to improving transparency on the issue.  I will forward the information in due course to the Deputy, when it has been supplied and examined by my Department.

With the exception of the merged Anglo Irish Bank and INBS where the matter remains open, burden sharing with the senior bondholders of the banks does not form part of this strategy.  It is the Minister's firm opinion that this was and remains the optimum strategy not least because it guarantees the continued funding of the banking system and the supply of at least €30 billion of lending into the domestic economy until 2013, despite the deleveraging of non-core banking assets.The Deputy will be aware that in the previous three months, very considerable progress has already been made in the implementation of this strategy in many cases significantly in advance of the originally anticipated deadlines.The legal mergers of Allied Irish Banks with the EBS Building Society, and of Anglo Irish Bank with INBS have been completed well ahead of the scheduled delivery dates of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011, respectively.The proposed name change of the merged Anglo Irish Bank has been announced to Irish Bank Resolution Company and a number of the foreign branches are being closed.The merged Anglo Irish Bank has already commenced the process of selling $10 billion of US property lending assets.All on-going banks have split into core and non-core management teams and identified non-core assets for disposal.€4.4billion of burden sharing has already been secured.As a result of the successful liability management debt for equity exercise in Bank of Ireland, a continuing free float element of circa 30% has been ensured.  The State's obligation to buy shares in this bank may decrease even further depending on both the outcome of the current rights offering and ongoing discussions with private equity.Information Memoranda in respect of the sale of Irish Life have already been circulated to interested parties in advance of the Troika deadline of October 2011.

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) appointed Goldman Sachs International, following a competitive tender process involving a number of advisory firms, as advisors as part of its Banking Unit's involvement in overseeing the capital raising exercise of the four financial institutions (Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Life and Permanent), following the announcement of the results of the Central Bank's PCAR/PLAR process on 31 March 2011. Fees of up to €7.8m may be payable to Goldman Sachs depending on completion of transactions and performance.I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that it expects to recoup the external advisory fees associated with the NTMA Banking Unit's involvement in the oversight of the capital raising exercise from the four financial institutions (Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Life and Permanent). The fees include the costs associated with achieving burden-sharing with holders of subordinated debt together with costs in relation to raising of additional capital.  Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been a National Pensions Reserve Fund investment manager since March 2002, managing a North American equities portfolio. Goldman Sachs Asset Management was appointed under EU public procurement rules.The NTMA recognised Goldman Sachs International as one of its sixteen Primary Dealers in Irish Government bonds in February 2010. The Primary Dealers each make continuous two-way prices in designated benchmark bonds in specified minimum amounts and within specified maximum bid-offer spreads. They have exclusive access to the NTMA's bond auctions. These are not contractual arrangements and the NTMA does not pay fees to Primary Dealers.Anglo Irish Bank, which intends to change its name to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited following its merger with Irish Nationwide Building Society, has retained Goldman Sachs International, since July 2006, as the sole prime broker for its AIAC Long/Short Equity fund. The prime broker provides a range of services that relate to cash or security positions including centralised securities clearing facilities, acting as settlement agent, providing custodial services, financing of margined long or short cash and securities positions and associated reporting services.

In view, amongst other things, of the poor quality of some of the submissions, Revenue anticipate that this will take at least another 2 to 3 months to complete.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.The Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection and seizure of controlled drugs at importation. It has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports and airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier. Revenue's annual Corporate Plans reflect the actions and targets outlined in the current 2009-2016 and in the earlier 2000-2008 National Drugs Strategy. The Revenue Corporate Plan for 2011 states that Revenue will contribute to the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 targets through increased drugs supply detections in 2011 with improved intelligence and enhanced Memoranda of Understanding programmes.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a permanent customs presence at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and at the main ports and the staffing resource at these locations is kept under ongoing review. It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principle of freedom of movement within the EU. Of specific relevance is the abolition of routine and systematic customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the Union. This is particularly relevant in the case of airfields where traffic is predominantly intra-Community.In this context, Revenue's approach has, of necessity, been to balance the freedom of movement principle in relation to persons and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions. In this regard all enforcement interventions in intra-Community traffic across the European Union are by necessity carried out on a risk and intelligence basis. International experience has also shown that this is the most effective and productive approach in the fight against drug smuggling.Customs controls at regional airports and public and private aerodromes are risk-based and are carried out by mobile customs enforcement officers. Attendance by these officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, local traffic frequency and routes and on other profiling indicators. Attendance can also result from specific intelligence relevant to a particular location. Flights with origins and destinations attracting a high-risk rating attract particular interest. Attendance by customs enforcement personnel covers the full range of flight times and is adapted to take account of emerging trends and any increase or changes to traffic at particular airfields. There were 606 enforcement visits undertaken to regional airports and public and private aerodromes in 2008, 694 in 2009 and 635 in 2010.Revenue's Customs Service liaises and shares intelligence on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement agencies such as An Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, Air Corps and foreign customs and police services. It participates on a regular basis in European bilateral and national surveillance operations focused on specific drug smuggling methodologies and routings. Some of these operations are specifically directed at light aircraft and helicopter movements. Both Customs and Gardaí meet regularly and work closely together to improve co-operation with the operators of airfields to help them prevent the use of their facilities by persons involved in international drug trafficking.I am aware of the criminal case referred to by the Deputy, which was the subject of a previous Parliamentary Question. I am not in a position to comment on the operational aspects of any given case. However, in 2007, in the light of concerns following that particular drug seizure, the Customs Service carried out an extensive review of controls at private airfields and have implemented the recommendations arising from that review. In this regard I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that current controls and monitoring at these locations are effective and proportionate and in line with best international practice.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The Deputy may be aware that under the terms of the government recapitalisation, both pillar banks produce a quarterly report which incorporates figures for balance sheet volumes, sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs. The data contained in these reports will continue to be reviewed and analysed by my Department and the Credit Review Office to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.The most recent quarterly report by the Credit Reviewer which was published in May gave information on the balance sheet share of lending by both AIB and Bank of Ireland at end March 2011 and compared this with January 2010. The Hotel and Restaurant sector was 17% of the SME balance sheet in January 2010 and remained at the same 17% level in March 2011. Therefore I would conclude that the hospitality sector is not disproportionately affected in relation to credit.The Deputy will be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.As I have said before the Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank's decision to refuse or reduce credit. This is another means of ensuring that the money is lent to the productive sector. I would strongly advise anyone who has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank's own internal appeals process to seek a review by the Credit Review Office. Last week, I raised the threshold for reviews from €250,000 to €500,000 to bring more credit refusals within the scope of the Credit Review Office.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working with both banks to develop staff who are well versed in the issues facing exporters especially in the emerging sectors and are capable of cashflow based lending.Last week I published some of the suggestions sent in by members of the public in response to my Credit Suggestions Initiative on how to improve the number of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) applying for credit.  The public has now been invited to comment on the published list with a view to improving and refining them and my officials will be working on the assessment of the suggestions at the same time.

Employees of the institutions are not public servants for the purposes of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  As I said in my reply to question 19918/11, I will ask the institutions to write to the Deputy to provide the information on the numbers employed in each over the past five years.  Conditions of employment, pay and redundancy are a matter for the normal human resources and industrial relations policies of the various institutions but are subject to certain restrictions and approvals either by me as Minister for Finance or by the NTMA/NPRFC as shareholders.As the Deputy will be aware, regarding the general issue of bank remuneration, I have asked the NTMA to request a review of remuneration policies and practices by each of the covered institutions.  In that regard, the institutions have been asked to consider measures that could be taken to realign staff expectations with regard to remuneration and benefits in the current economic environment and financial circumstances of the banks.  The review exercise is ongoing and the NTMA expects to receive the requested information shortly from all the institutions in order to allow a comprehensive evaluation to take place.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question has been the subject of an ongoing Revenue audit.  In September 2010 the taxpayer's agent agreed a basis for settlement with the Revenue auditor — essentially involving the set off of underpaid tax, interest and penalty against relevant contracts tax credits, with a small balance to be refunded.  At that meeting, the agent said that he would recommend this settlement to the taxpayer.  However, despite multiple contacts by the Revenue auditor with the taxpayer's agent and with the taxpayer, the audit has still not been formally agreed.  There has been no indication from the taxpayer or his agent that they disagree with Revenue's computation of the underpayment amount (against which the relevant contracts credits are to be set off) and no alternative computations or proposals have been forthcoming.Prior to the commencement of the audit, the Revenue Commissioners made a partial refund to the taxpayer in respect of relevant contracts tax credits. A statement did issue to the taxpayer in September 2008, from the Collector General's office, showing a credit balance of €18,262.  However, this statement clearly indicated that the question of any refund of this credit balance was subject to Revenue's right to collect additional tax due in respect of outstanding or incorrect returns.  When the additional tax liabilities were identified during the course of the audit, the Revenue auditor proposed that the credit balance of relevant contracts tax would be offset against the additional liabilities under the audit settlement. The taxpayer's agent, as part of the proposed audit settlement, agreed this offset.At all times the Revenue Commissioners have sought to make the taxpayer and his agent aware of the position in the case and on the basis of the facts set out above, neither the taxpayer nor his agent could reasonably have anticipated any significant refund being due.  The taxpayer is advised by Revenue to now engage with the Kildare District so as to reach closure on this matter.

At this point, no funds have yet been drawn down under the agreement. The agreement provides that the interest rate on the amounts drawn down will be based on the Sterling Pound mid-market semi-annual swap rate at the time of drawdown plus a margin of 2.29% per annum.  At the time that the UK loan facility agreement was signed the overall interest cost was calculated at about 5.9%, similar to the blended rate calculated by the EU Commission for the troika loans at the time our Programme was agreed last year. The actual rate will depend on the market rates prevailing at the time of disbursement.  I have not formally raised the issue of an interest rate reduction with the UK Government to date.

Discussions on the terms and conditions are continuing. The interest rate on each will be based on the 3-month Euribor interest rate, a market reference rate of good standing, plus a margin yet to be agreed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The IMF loans to Ireland under the EU/IMF Programme come from the quota subscriptions of its member countries and a new arrangement whereby certain countries and institutions provide a back-stop facility. This is in sharp contrast to the EFSF/EFSM which access the general capital markets for funds through the sale of marketable bonds when funding opportunities present themselves.Under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, the official name of the fund used, interest is due quarterly at the IMF's standard interest rate.  The interest rate is the IMF's basic rate of charge plus surcharges which are based on the size of the loan relative to the country's IMF quota. An amount of 1% is charged over the SDR interest rate to give the basic rate of charge. In addition a level-based surcharge of 2% for amounts over 300% of the borrower's quota is added. This surcharge is modified after three years such that a further 1% is added. This added surcharge is referred to as the time-based surcharge. In addition to the interest charge there is a once off up front handling fee of 0.5% for all disbursements. Repayments in respect of each disbursement are made by way of 12 equal semi-annual payments that commence 4½ years after disbursement.The SDR interest rate is reset weekly and is based on a weighted average of the three-month Eurepo rate, three-month Japanese Treasury Discount bills, three-month UK Treasury bills, and three-month US Treasury bills. The current SDR interest rate is 0.58% but could change significantly over the life of the programme.I am informed by the IMF that its surcharges are automatically placed in its reserves to protect the value of assets that member countries place with it. It says that the security of these assets means that the IMF's cost of funds is low, being a weighted average of 3-month Treasury bill rates for the US, Japan, and UK, and the 3-month eurepo rate. This low cost of funds is passed on to borrowing countries as a lower interest rate. As of July 11, the interest rate due on Fund credit is 1.6% on the first 300 percent of quota, and 3.6% on amounts above 300 percent of quota.I understand from the NTMA that the total amount of interest and surcharges over the basic SDR rate due under the extended arrangement, assuming all disbursements are made as scheduled and all repayments are also made as scheduled (with the last repayment in 2023), is estimated at SDR 4,115 million, which is equivalent to €4637 million based on the July 11 SDR/€ exchange rate. Unlike the EFSF and EFSM, it is possible to pay the IMF borrowing back early without penalty, should circumstances allow at some point in the future, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.In November, the EU Commission agreed that the methodology used to calculate the cost of funds from the EFSM would be designed so as to generate a cost of funds from the EFSM at a rate similar to the cost of IMF funds. At the time it was calculated that the IMF floating rate translated to a Euro fixed 7.5 year rate of 5.7%.  This 5.7% interest rate was calculated using market rates in November. This figure was indicative only, based on market conditions at that time, and not a commitment.The gap between the interest charged to Ireland on its EFSM borrowings and the 5.7% is explained by the cost of funds in the bond market. The financial assistance programme envisages a weighted average maturity of 7.5 years for EFSM loans to Ireland and the EFSM achieves this by issuing bonds of different maturities. In general, bonds with longer maturities will have higher yields, or costs of funds. This has been reflected in the borrowing to date.To date, Ireland's nominal borrowings from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism under the EU/IMF Programme amount to €11.4 billion. The weighted average interest on the EFSM borrowings to date is 5.91% with a weighted average maturity of 6.87 years.  Details of these loans, including the nominal interest rates for the EFSM, which is the rate used to calculate the amount of interest due on the loans for Ireland, as supplied by the NTMA to my Department, are set out in the table.LenderNominal Loan amountAmount DisbursedDate  of Draw downMaturityfrom date of receipt.Interest Rate used to calculate ongoing payments(Borrowing Cost including margin but excluding fees)EFSM€5.00 billion€4.973 billion12-Jan-114 years 11 months5.425%€3.40 billion€3.39 billion24-Mar-117 years6.175%€3.00 billion€2.986 billion31-May-1110 years6.425%Overall Totals / Weighted Averages€11.4 billion€11.35 billionn/a6.87 years5.91%**This rate is based on the coupon of the bonds issued by the EFSM to finance the loan, plus the margin of 2.925%.Notwithstanding the data supplied, I am advised by the NTMA that the appropriate interest rate to use to assess the overall cost of a particular loan is the all-in cost of borrowing or yield.  On this basis the overall EFSM weighted average interest rate, including all costs on loans drawn down to date is calculated at 5.99%.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax which replaces the income and health levies. It is intended to broaden the tax base in an equitable manner. It has a wider base and a lower rate when compared to the combined impact of the income and health levies.  USC receipts are collected by the Revenue Commissioners as a component of income tax.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that receipts from the USC amounted to €1,218 million in the first six months of 2011. This compares to a projected yield of €1,241 million for the first six months so receipts were close to target.Monthly profiles of receipts from the income and health levies, as they had previously applied, were not prepared as these levies have been replaced by the USC. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate with any precision the amount that they would have generated in the first six months of the year had they remained in place or to compare this to the amount that has been collected in USC receipts in the first half of the year.Had the income and health levies remained in place, it is expected that they would have generated €1.5 billion and €2.1 billion, respectively, in receipts in 2011 or €3.6 billion in total. Receipts from the USC combined with arrears in respect of the income and health levies were estimated to generate €3.6 billion in 2011, thus ensuring revenue neutrality in 2011.  However, as I have indicated over the course of the year as a whole, receipts from the USC and arrears in respect of the income and health levies are expected to generate the same amount as would have been generated had the levies remained in place.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 121, inclusive, together.The Deputy will be aware that the radical restructuring of the Irish banking system which I announced on March 31 and the very fundamental recapitalisation of the Irish banks involves many complicated capital markets and legal decisions.  We have embarked on perhaps the most complicated systemwide banking restructuring ever and doing so in the rapid timeframe involved requires considerable expertise and resources.  Making the right choices is critical to ensure best value for the State.  Equally, the raising of capital when placing shares and the like invariably involves significant underwriting and other fees.The engagement by banks of advisors is not only typical in this situation, it is also necessary to help make the best decisions and prevent making costly errors.  We would expect banks to be conscious of obtaining best value and before engaging advisors, to make comparative choices as part of their procurement process.  Recognising that the State is now a significant shareholder in the banks, my Department has however since March streamlined the use of advisors by eliminating considerable duplication and where appropriate utilising the services of the advisors already engaged by the banks which has permitted considerable saving to the taxpayers.  There are however occasions where it is necessary for the State to have its own advisors where the interests of the state taxpayer and the banks might not be fully aligned.The added value for the State in having these advisors has substantially outweighed the cost. The Deputy is reminded that €4.4 billion of burden sharing has already been secured. As I stated in a response to question number 18684 on 5 July from the Deputy,  I have been informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that it expects to recoup the external advisory fees associated with the NTMA Banking Unit's involvement in the oversight of the capital raising exercise from AIB, Bank of Ireland, ILP and EBS.  The Deputy will also be aware that, in relation to Bank of Ireland, the State is receiving fees totalling circa €100 million in relation to the capital raise (underwriting fees, contingent capital instrument fees, VAT etc.).Turning to the questions relating to the EBS, the Deputy will be aware that the EBS is an independent economic entity which operates at arm's length from the Government. Nonetheless, as I said previously, we would expect it to be conscious of obtaining best value and before engaging advisors to make comparative choices as part of their procurement process.  EBS selected BNP Paribas as dealer manager for the execution of the Tier 2 transaction. Having previously executed a buyback transaction for INBS, BNP Paribas had valuable knowledge of the Irish subordinated debt market. When conducting an offering of this sort, an institution is required to hire a dealer manager with sufficient market expertise and knowledge in order to aid in structuring, pricing and execution of the transaction.  No financial advisor was used on the Tier 1 transaction as this did not involve the same level of financial structuring and execution.EBS used Arthur Cox to advise on Irish legal aspects of the transactions. EBS did not seek quotes from other firms as Arthur Cox had acted for EBS in the previous buyback transaction which was only completed in February 2011.  In particular, the Tier 1 redemption was complex and it was considered most efficient in terms of time, cost and potential litigation risk to use lawyers that understood the detail of the original deal.  It was likewise considered most economic to use the same legal firm for the Tier 2 transaction to avoid duplication of time and cost. I should add that lawyers from the UK and Luxembourg also provided advice given the nature of the transaction and were appointed on a similar basis.

These institutions continue to be managed at arm's length basis, notwithstanding the large shareholding the Government holds.  This is important from the point of view of ensuring that their operations are managed by their respective boards and management on a commercial basis with a view to securing the maximum return to the taxpayer. The Deputy should note that four of the institutions have been merged earlier this month.  I do not therefore intend to compile the data sought by the Deputy at the level of detail he is seeking, and to do so in response to a large volume of parliamentary questions each with its own variation on the information sought will involve an undue burden on official time.However, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and I have indicated, in answers to other questions today, that I am asking the institutions to compile data on staff numbers and remuneration practices and details with a view, as part of the remuneration review presently being conducted by the institutions at the request of my Department, to improving transparency on the issue.  I will forward the information in due course to the Deputy, when it has been supplied and examined by my Department.  As part of the review underway, the Deputy will also be aware, that the institutions have been asked to consider measures that could be taken to realign staff expectations with regard to remuneration and benefits in the current economic environment and financial circumstances of the banks.

The USC is designed to apply across income levels in a smoother progression.  It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It should be noted that there are certain exemptions and reliefs from the USC.  Persons in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection such as the widowed person's contributory State pension are exempt from the USC.  In addition, there are also concessions for medical card holders and persons aged 70 or over who are not liable to the top rate of charge.It is not possible to properly analyse and compare individual cases without knowing the details of the income and circumstances of the individuals being compared.  However, it is true to say that after Budget 2011 a widowed person will still pay less tax than a single individual on the same income.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to carry out a review of the USC.  This review has already commenced.

While many tourist related services were made subject to a new temporary lower reduced VAT rate of 9% from 1 July, it is not possible to extend this treatment to all goods and services that had been subject to the 13.5% rate.While hairdressing services apply at the new temporary 9% rate, services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauty salons, will remain subject to the 13.5% rate.  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this continuation of reduced rate application is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as ‘parked' items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As the services provided by beauty salons are part of these parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.It is for this reason that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 introduced a 9% VAT rate in respect of tourist activities such as restaurant and hotel accommodation services, while other tourist activities such as tour guide services and the short-term hire of cars, boat, caravans and mobile homes remain liable to VAT at the 13.5%.  However, it should be noted that in the majority of EU Member States services consisting of the care of the human body apply at their standard VAT rate of up to 25% in some cases, compared to 13.5% in Ireland.

SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.Both pillar banks provide my Department with monthly figures on balance sheet volumes, sanctioned facilities and geographic and industrial breakdowns of their SME lending. The Deputy may also be aware that under the terms of the government recapitalisation, both banks also produce a quarterly report which incorporates figures for sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs. The data contained in these reports will continue to be reviewed and analysed by my Department and the Credit Review Office to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.  I expect the pillar banks which have received considerable Government support to develop and offer a range of products to support SMEs and to ensure that lending targets are met.As I have said before the Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank's decision to refuse or reduce credit.  Invoice discounting is included in the definition of credit facility which can be reviewed.  I would strongly advise anyone who has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank's own internal appeals process to seek a review by the Credit Review Office.  Just last week, I raised the threshold for reviews by the Credit Review Office from €250,000 to €500,000.

Its publication last May is very timely as it will feed directly into the debate of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector which I launched in mid-April.  Professor John Coolahan, Chairperson of the Advisory Group to the Forum, at its recent three day session in mid June, noted that "It is also fortunate that a number of reports have been available at this time which deal with relevant and cognate issues". He cited the Irish Human Rights Commission report as one of these reports.  The Advisory Group has met with officials from the IHRC and discussed the report with them. The IHRC report sets out thirteen recommendations and these will be considered as part of the evidence available to the Forum.

These recurrent funds include core recurrent grants, grants in respect of the "Free Fees" Scheme, funding in respect of increased student intake, supplementary funding requirements, and other miscellaneous initiatives that may require funding.The majority of post-primary teachers qualify through the institute of technology/university route, by completion of a suitable undergraduate degree, and the Postgraduate Diploma in Education.  Undergraduate degrees for this purpose are generally of 3 or 4 years duration.  The cost of providing undergraduate degrees varies from programme to programme.  However, I am advised by the HEA that the approximate annual cost of providing a Bachelor of Arts degree would be in the region of €7,000 per student.  Concurrent Bachelor of Education courses are generally of 4 years duration.  The approximate annual cost of providing the B.Ed. is in the region of €9,000-€10,000 per student.Costs for both primary degrees and concurrent degrees are met through the student fee (paid through the Free Fees scheme), core grant funding and the student contribution.  The cost of providing a 1 year postgraduate diploma in education for post-primary teaching is estimated to be in the region of €8,000.  This is met through a combination of student fees and recurrent funding from the HEA.

Amongst these are initiatives at both pre service and in service level including the introduction of a new Post Graduate Diploma in Education for teaching at post primary level delivered in full through the medium of Irish and a new post graduate programme for a Diploma in Irish Language Education (Primary Teaching) which will provide specialised skills in Irish to those who have already completed a teacher education programme. The Strategy also envisages the provision of short-cycle and on-line professional development for serving teachers.A working group has recently been established, under the auspices of the Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht, to scope out and agree the steps required to implement the strategy over the 20 year period.  Implementation will also have to take account of the availability of resources.  This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and will deliver on the achievable goals and targets proposed.In relation to the current provision of professional development, it is policy to provide services through the medium of Irish to teachers in Irish-medium schools.  Every effort is made by the teacher support services including the PDST, Project Maths to provide a high quality service to those teachers within the resources provided.  An tSeirbhís Tacaíochta Dara Leibhéal don Ghaeilge is a full time team dedicated to providing support to teachers of Irish in all post primary schools.  Other supports include summer courses and online resources, as well as a wide range of supports provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	652	The generally accepted definition of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) refers to the teaching of a curricular subject through the medium of a language other than that normally used for instruction.  As Irish is the language of instruction for all subjects in Irish-medium schools, teaching through a language which may not be the normal language of communication of the student is a permanent feature of the teaching approach in these schools.While there is a wide range of supports available for teachers in the Irish medium sector, the post-primary teacher support services do not currently provide specific CLIL in-service training.  An tSeirbhís Tacaíochta don Dara Leibheáil (STDL) don Gaeilge is primarily engaged in an intensive phase of support related to assessment changes, however, it also offers support which is specific to the needs of Irish-medium schools and into which elements of CLIL are incorporated.  An Chomhairle Um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta (COGG) has also been very active in recent years in commissioning materials in the Irish language to support the teaching of subjects in second-level schools.  Such textbooks and ancillary resources are integral to the CLIL approach. In addition, in 2010 my Department supported a National University of Ireland, Galway conference on CLIL which was aimed at looking at new methods for teaching Irish, and for teaching subjects through Irish.  The conference was open to both primary and post-primary teachers.The 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 contains a number of actions relating to improving the quality of Irish teaching.  Amongst these is a recommendation that from as early as possible in Phase II, it is proposed to move towards a situation, beginning in the infant classes in the primary sector, where partial Irish language immersion will be offered to all children.A working group has recently been established, under the auspices of the Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht, to scope out and agree the steps required to implement the strategy over the 20 year period.  Implementation will also have to take account of the availability of resources.  This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and will deliver on the achievable goals and targets proposed.

As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.  The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.Circular 0042/2007 announced that the proportion of marks available for oral assessment in the certificate examinations would be  increased to 40% with effect from 2010 in the optional oral test in the junior certificate, and this change will take effect from 2012 in the Leaving Certificate examination.  The intention of the increase in marks for oral assessment is to promote a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.The Leaving Certificate model of oral examination is not replicable at junior cycle level due to factors of examiner supply and school disruption.  However, as part of the junior certificate review, the overall assessment arrangements are also being reviewed.  I expect the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on the direction of reform in the autumn.

Following these inspection processes the inspectors facilitate feedback meetings during which the strengths of the school or subject department are acknowledged and clear recommendations are communicated in relation to the further improvement of educational provision in the school. A draft report issues to the school for factual verification and, following completion of this stage, the school is invited to respond to the report, in writing. The report is subsequently published on my Department's website.Responsibility for the implementation of recommendations arising from inspection reports rests primarily with the board of management and the principal and staff of the school. Schools take action to progress the recommendations for improvement noted in evaluation reports through the school's management structures and procedures including its school development planning and review arrangements. The great majority of schools have the capacity and expertise to devise specific action plans and to coordinate initiatives by the board, the management and teaching staff to address any recommendations or shortcomings identified through external inspection or indeed through internal school self-evaluation.My Department has made a significant investment over the last decade in supporting schools to engage in school development planning and school self-review and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) continues to provide high quality continuous professional development and support for teachers, at primary and post-primary levels. Schools may seek support, in specific circumstances, from the PDST for assistance with school improvement following inspection.In a very small number of schools, the weaknesses identified through external inspection are so significant that intervention is required to assist the school improvement agenda. In these cases officials from my Department engage with the school to ensure that actions and interventions are tailored to the particular circumstances and context of the school.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that further materials to support school self-evaluation and school improvement in all schools will be issued, by the Inspectorate of my Department, early in the new school year. These resources for schools will complement the existing Looking at Our School guidelines on school self-evaluation in primary and post-primary schools.

Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. The SENOs are a valuable local resource to parents in this context.The Inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the evaluation of primary and post-primary schools and centres for education and for the provision of advice to the educational system and policy makers. The inspectorate works to improve learning outcomes for students in schools and centres for education.  I do not intend to revisit or combine the separate roles and functions of the inspectorate or the SENOS.

The legislative proposals followed extensive consultations with survivors of residential abuse and the groups which support them, together with a public consultation process.While some former residents advocated a simple distribution of the available money others support the establishment of the Fund. I believe that the Fund should target resources at services to support the needs of former residents that suffered abuse.  The report on the consultation process and the General Scheme of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill are available on my Department's website and I believe that the availability of the detailed arrangements proposed for the Fund will remove any misconceptions regarding the scope of the Fund.  I will be meeting with groups representing survivors of residential institutional abuse to discuss the proposals later this month and I am confident that the proposals will receive broad support.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.The qualifying criteria for the allocation of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02.  The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	663	Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  The decisions announced included the uniform application of the distance requirement, cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR), the minimum number of eligible children required to establish and retain services and the introduction of charges for eligible primary pupils.In the case of the cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR) there are broadly two aspects to this change. The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the application of the distance eligibility criterion to all children travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This change to school transport provision means that the distance eligibility criterion will be applied uniformly and equitably on a national basis.The practical impact is that children categorised for transport under the CSR who reside less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school will lose their transport eligibility. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport at an annual charge, currently €200 per pupil, subject to a family maximum of €650 per annum. There is no exemption from this charge.  An annual charge for eligible primary pupils will be introduced from the commencement of the 2011/12 school year. This charge is set at €50 per pupil with a maximum family charge of €110 for primary pupils. Eligible pupils who hold valid medical cards will be exempt from this charge.  Eligible children with special educational needs will continue to travel free.

Bus Éireann is monitoring the situation and this figure may change if late applications are received or current applicants do not purchase tickets.It should be noted that over 123,000 pupils on 6,000 routes availed of school transport services in the 2010/11 school year. As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.

I can assure the Deputy that the ongoing response by my Department to the Ryan Report is receiving my full attention.  The Deputy may be aware that I have recently outlined the Government's plans to progress issues raised in the follow up to the Ryan Report.The final cost of the response to residential institutional child abuse is estimated to be in the region of €1.36 billion.  The Government believes that this cost should be shared on a 50:50 basis, between the taxpayer and those responsible for managing the institutions where horrendous child abuse took place.  I will be meeting shortly with groups representing survivors of residential institutional abuse and representatives of the religious congregations in relation to the measures announced and to further the stated wish of the Government that an equitable settlement is reached.

My Department is finalising arrangements to introduce concessionary transport, in certain circumstances, for ineligible children with special educational needs from the beginning of the 2011/12 school year.  Detailed information on the updated scheme will be available on my Department's website shortly.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	677	In 2010/11 there were 876 Canadian students in Irish higher education institutions, making Canada the 8th largest source country for international students in Ireland.  I understand that most of the Irish universities, as well as a number of the Institutes of Technology, also have student exchange agreements with Canadian universities.   The Canadian Embassy supports a number of programmes for Irish academics to encourage curriculum development and research on Canadian or Irish Canadian issues.  The Ireland Canada University Foundation operates the Dobbin Scholarship Programme of visiting research scholarships to Irish and Canadian scholars and its Irish Language Programme supports the teaching of Gaeilge in Canadian universities. UCD hosts the "Craig Dobbin Chair of Canadian Studies" which enables a visiting Canadian professor to work in UCD for a 2 year period.   Other organisations that contribute to academic exchange include the Association for Canadian Studies in Ireland, the Canadian Association for Irish Studies and the Ireland-Newfoundland Partnership.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 185 together.Changes to the Primary School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money review of the scheme.  The decisions announced include the uniform application of the distance eligibility criterion, the cessation of the Closed/Central School Rule (CSR), an increase in the minimum number of eligible children required to establish or retain a service and the introduction of charges for eligible primary pupils.In the case of the CSR there are broadly two aspects to this change. The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance eligibility criterion to all children travelling under the Primary School Transport Scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. The practical impact is that children categorised for transport under the CSR who reside less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school will lose their transport eligibility. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport subject to the terms of the scheme.  Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that 63 schools in Donegal and 410 nationally will be affected by this change.The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of children commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility to children who meet the distance eligibility criterion and who are travelling to their nearest school. A sample survey undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review showed that the majority of pupils are in fact attending their nearest open school, so this change will not have any practical impact on these pupils.A further change which will take effect in September 2011 is the increase from 7 to 10 in the number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to retain or establish a school transport service. In general, this means that the minimum number required to establish or retain a service broadly represents a return to 2002 levels. As is currently the position, a Remote Area Grant is payable for eligible children for whom no transport service is available.  This change will affect 7 schools in Donegal and over 120 schools nationally.An annual charge for eligible primary pupils will be introduced from the commencement of the 2011/12 school year. This charge is set at €50 per pupil with a maximum family charge of €110 for primary pupils. The charge of €50 represents some 5% recoupment of the actual cost. Pupils with valid medical cards will be exempt from this charge. This charge is being introduced to ensure that school transport services are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.It is essential to stress that the wider context within which all these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and these measures are an integral part of this.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form, including those relating to nationality and/or immigration status, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant.  However, it is the student's own nationality and his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirements for a grant under the Student Support Act, 2011.  Accordingly, the student in question is advised to apply to his/her grant awarding authority to have his/her eligibility for a grant assessed.

The school was advised by my Department that the 31,688 approved places were fully utilised and that no additional PLC places were available.Each application is examined by my Department on its merits, taking into account current and previous allocations, current and previous demand and uptake, the overall places available and the overall demand from providers generally. Regard is also had in this context to ensuring appropriate provision on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.County Mayo has an allocation of 725 PLC places for the 2011/2012 academic year.  There are currently 13 PLC providers in Co. Mayo, 7 schools managed by Co. Mayo VEC, including one in the same town as the school referred to by the Deputy, 4 voluntary secondary schools and 2 community and comprehensive schools.  Given the number of providers offering PLC courses in County Mayo my Department considers that sanction for an additional provider is not warranted.

Due to the scale of demand for funding under the scheme, it was not possible to fund all applications. The school was advised accordingly.In relation to the Deputy's reference to funding for emergency works, it is open to the school concerned to submit an application for such funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is solely for unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils. An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening. Details of the Scheme concerned, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on the Department's website at www.education.ie.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.The child to whom the Deputy refers is currently in receipt of home tuition. Allocation of home tuition for the next school year will be subject to applicants meeting the eligibility criteria.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has advised that a school placement is available for the child in question from September and the parent should liaise with the NCSE in this regard.The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	683	At one time the churches, including the catholic church, were required to make a local contribution to the national schools under their patronage to meet the day to day running costs, essentially capitation. There was no requirement for a local contribution to capitation at second level.The requirement to provide a local contribution was discontinued in 2001 in respect of capitation funding.  Prior to 1999 a local contribution of 15% for primary schools and 10% for post-primary schools was sought for capital projects built on land not owned by the State.  In 1999 the then Government announced a significant change in the way local contribution was levied, introduced a ceiling on the local contribution and reduced the percentage to be paid locally on school capital projects.In recent years, a number of measures were taken to reduce further the local contribution burden, these were:No local contributions were sought for special education projects in mainstream schools, even where the land was not owned by the State.No local contributions were sought for projects delivered under the Small Schools Scheme or Permanent Accommodation Scheme, a single all inclusive grant was paid under these schemes.A rolling five year period was used to reduce local contributions for Summer Works Scheme projects.In October 2010, the previous Government approved the discontinuation of the policy of seeking a local contribution for all new primary and post-primary projects commencing construction and the rental of temporary accommodation.  Under an arrangement dating back to the introduction of the Free Education scheme in 1967, the Boards of Management of voluntary secondary schools are required to pay a portion of the salaries of teachers they employ. This is known as the Teachers' Salary Grant and amounts to €562 per teacher. This sum is deducted by my Department from the capitation grants due to voluntary secondary schools who do not charge fees. The Teachers' Salary Grant is repaid directly to my Department by voluntary secondary schools that charge fees, as they do not receive any capitation funding from my Department. This grant amounted to €4.98 million in 2010.

Parents can  contact SENOs directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which assists parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date.  From the details supplied by the Deputy it appears that the NEWB and the NCSE are involved in the case and should liaise with officials in my Department as appropriate or if necessary to progress securing a placement for the child in question.

Of the 40 new schools, one new post-primary school will be located in the North County Dublin/South County Louth area.  I also announced the introduction of new arrangements for the recognition of both primary and post-primary schools that will provide an opportunity for all patrons to seek to apply for patronage of these schools.  My Department will shortly inform patron bodies of the details of the first schools that are to be established. Applications for patronage of the new schools will then be sought.  Officials from my Department's Forward Planning Section met last September with members of the committee referred to by the Deputy.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The Irish application for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) co-financing assistance in support of workers made redundant at the S R Technics aircraft maintenance facility at Dublin Airport in 2009 was for a total of €11,455,174, of which the approved EU contribution is €7,445,863.The only expenditure data available to my Department at this stage related to the monies actually paid out directly by the Department itself. To date, the Department has paid out a total of €538,626 for enterprise supports and third level programmes under the SR Technics EGF programme. The EGF programme allocation not yet drawn down is therefore €10,916,548. Activity on the ground continues to be delivered under a range of headings.  As stated in my previous reply to Parliamentary Question 15079/11 of 14 June 2011, it is not yet possible to provide a detailed breakdown of incurred or committed expenditure on the EGF programme while new or additional claims from various service providers are still awaited or are being processed.We still have some months left to run during which eligible interventions can be undertaken in the SR Technics programme. The Irish authorities have until 9 March 2012 to submit a final report for the execution of the EGF financial contribution including a statement justifying EGF programme expenditure to the European Commission.  An independent administrative and technical support group was contracted by the Department on 9 June 2011 to assist in the collection and collation of all relevant financial and management information data that will further inform progress on the ground and that is required for the production of the final report on the implementation of this EGF programme to the European Commission.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year. The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a review process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.

It was the practice in the case of such amalgamations to provide transport to the amalgamated schools and it is likely that this was conveyed as part of the overall process. Given that there were in excess of 800 schools covered by such amalgamations, and given the time remove since the date of many of these amalgamations, it is not feasible to source individual school records.

However, it will be available to the school for the commencement of the 2011-12 school year. The Department has secured the use of a building in Kildare town which was previously occupied by a former Vocational School. It is intended that this premises will provide permanent accommodation for the school in the long term.The school has indicated its preference to relocate to another premises in Kildare town, but the Department is satisfied that the long term needs of the school can be met through the upgrade of the VEC building in Kildare town which will be available to the Department at a nominal figure.  In a recent meeting the Department outlined to the school's representatives its plans for the long-term accommodation needs of the school in Kildare town.

One of the nationality criteria is where a student has been granted permission to remain in the State as a family member of a Union citizen under the provisions of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 and 2008 and Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.  Where such family members are given permission to reside in the State by the Department of Justice and Equality, they will be issued with a residence card bearing the title ‘4EUFam'.The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for a student's local grant awarding body — the relevant local authority or VEC. The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details contained in an individual's application form, including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant.However, the nationality requirements for a grant are set out in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and in Article 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2011. It is the student's own nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not the nationality requirements are met.  The student in question is advised to apply to his/her grant awarding authority for assessment of eligibility or otherwise for a grant taking the totality of the provisions of the governing legislation into account.

Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their accommodation brief.  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing measures to reduce water usage such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc. To this end, as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, schools were invited to apply for Water Conservation measures and funding of almost €10m was made available to promote water conservation measures as part of this initiative.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The Deputy will be aware that late last year my Department issued guidelines addressed to public bodies and aimed at facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises in competing for public procurement opportunities. These guidelines maintained the existing threshold for advertising public works contracts in excess of €50,000 on the e-tenders website.   The main reasons for setting the threshold at this level is to open up public procurement opportunities to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and to achieve value for taxpayer's money through a competitive and transparent tendering process. It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used.It is worth noting that there are a number of guidance documents and model form contracts aimed at facilitating public bodies in carrying out public works contracts. This information can be found on the construction procurement website www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie     These new public procurement guidelines will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	703	The Implementation Body for the Public Service Agreement 2010 — 2014 published its first progress report on 15th June last.  The Body found that, over the twelve months to end March 2011, sustainable Exchequer pay bill savings in the order of €289 million had been achieved, driven primarily by a reduction in public service staff numbers of 5,349 over the period. It is assumed the Deputy is referring to public service pension costs and not costs relating to the State Pension (either contributory or means-tested) paid by the Department of Social Protection.  Public service pension costs have increased over the period.  However, this is not a direct function of or causally linked to the Croke Park Agreement but, rather, represents costs which would arise in any event.  The cost increase is not due to the Croke Park Agreement but is essentially caused by increased longevity (i.e. fewer pensioners dying) and more people retiring normally.The Body's report, correctly, foot-noted the pension increase over the period but, equally correctly, did not seek to relate it to the Croke Park reform process.  The Body's Report also footnotes the costs associated with the voluntary early retirement and redundancy schemes which were offered in the HSE last year.  It should be noted that any voluntary early retirement scheme incurs up-front once-off costs while the savings remain sustainable into the future.As regards the payments to those who left under the most recent exit mechanisms, i.e. the HSE scheme and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER), the total amounts paid out in terms of lump sum and severance, including statutory redundancy, was of the order of €106 million.  The associated ongoing annual pension cost is of the order of €46 million.  Increased pension costs associated with the schemes decline over time as early retirees reach the age at which they would have retired in any event. In addition, some of those who retired under these schemes did so outside the relevant period within which the Croke Park Agreement was in operation, i.e. before March 2010.

The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001 which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire- Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area commenced with the signing of the valuation order on 5th May, 2011. This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013.It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas as soon as possible. The necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway with the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.  It is not possible to say at present when revaluation will commence in County Meath. While progress has been affected by the difficult conditions in the property market in recent years, nevertheless, the launch of the Dublin City revaluation is a significant advance and the Commissioner has indicated that he is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	705	The National Procurement Service (NPS) in the Office of Public Works is tasked with supporting procurement-related savings across the public service.  An area with potential for achieving savings for buyers and suppliers in the whole procure-to-pay process is the widespread adoption of electronic invoicing for public sector bodies and for business to business transactions in Ireland.In examining the potential for the implementation of electronic invoicing, the NPS has met with a number of public sector bodies which are considering implementing this technology, or which have already commenced pilot projects.  The NPS has also met with a number of service providers in the marketplace and looked at the implementation in other EU Member states (Denmark) and has been in contact with the European Commission in relation to the current projects under way in this area. Savings are achieved by reducing the administrative overhead involved when dealing with paper invoices; this applies to both the public and private sectors.While progressing developments on the initiative the NPS was requested by the European Commission to establish a National Multi-Stakeholder Forum on eInvoicing. This has been done.  Standards in e-invoicing are due to be agreed at European level later this year. At this time the NPS will be in a better position to decide on the appropriate approach to acquiring this service for the wider public sector. It is vital that the systems offered, by the various service providers, are interoperable so that suppliers can use one system to send invoices to all the public sector bodies with which they have dealings. It is hoped that the Forum will allow for consultation and can provide agreement and direction on eInvoicing initiatives.

Once staff are employed by a public service body they must be subject to the provision of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 irrespective of the sourcing of the funds from which they are paid.  In summary, it is the nature of the employing body, not the source of the funding, which determines the application of the provisions of the Act.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21303	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Matters to do with public procurement procedures fall to be considered by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who has overall responsibility for the Government's public procurement procedures. Matters concerned with the implementation of public procurement procedures in respect of particular contracts fall to be taken up with the relevant Government Departments in respect of the various contracting authorities operating under their aegis, including matters related to the self-certification process under local authority framework agreements which are a matter for my colleague the Minster for the Environment, Community and Local Government.All construction related projects involving public expenditure must conform to Department of Finance Public Procurement procedures. These procedures state that contracting firms including subcontractors must be compliant with all employment rights legislation in respect of pay and conditions of employment when engaged on public works contracts thereby creating a level playing field for competing tenders. Issues concerned with compliance regarding taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners.The standard public works contract between a contractor and procuring authority requires the contractor to undertake to ensure that the wage rates and other terms and conditions for all workers, including employees of sub-contractors comply with statutory provisions in the area of employment law.  Under current terms of public procurement contracts, the contractor is obliged, for the purposes of the reporting requirements during the course of the contract, to make a statement to the contracting authority, certifying compliance with the employment rights legislation in respect of each payment due under the contract.If anyone is aware of specific instances where public contracts have been awarded to firms that are not complying with pay and or other terms and conditions of employment, there are a number of ways in which the matter can be investigated through either, the relevant public authority that awarded the contract, through the dispute settlement system in respect of vindication of an employees rights such as through the Rights Commissioner service, or directly with the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). NERA has statutory authority to share information and carry-out joint investigations with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21303	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	709	An annual Exchequer allocation is provided each year for the operation of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs). The Exchequer allocation is made in the context of the overall public finances and in 2011 amounts to €27.242m, of which €15m in Capital is available for direct grants and training, mentoring and advice services to micro-enterprise clients.  The bulk of the non-capital allocation to each CEB pays the salaries of the Business Advisors and other staff who provide direct advice and mentoring to client companies. This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate.The CEB Central Coordination Unit (within Enterprise Ireland) works closely with the CEBs throughout the year reviewing individual expenditures to ensure that the funding allocated to the CEBs is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds.  Some Boards may choose to commit all of their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means that their funding is committed relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some funding until later in the year so that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  Should it arise during the year that some Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocation, for example where an approved grant is decommitted late in the year if the project has not started, it is reallocated to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds within the year.Substantial funds have been allocated to the CEBs in 2011 having due regard to the pressures on exchequer finances.  While I accept that it is vital that CEBs continue to promote and support enterprise development there is undoubtedly a high level of demand on CEBs resources at present, and due to the finite nature of public finances, it is not always possible for a CEB to provide financial assistance to every eligible project that presents itself.  This is an operating reality with which all CEBs are already familiar.

The names of those companies and their location in Ireland are set out in the tabular statement.  The IDA's strategy includes winning as many new jobs as possible each year and giving equal priority to maintaining existing jobs.  To address the need to maintain jobs in Ireland, IDA is actively encouraging its client companies to engage in transformation initiatives, and is assisting them in programmes to:Improve company-wide competitiveness.Enhance use of new technologies.Grow the skills of the business.Engage in Research, Development and Innovation.Develop new business processes.Make company operations more energy efficient.The combined influence of Ireland's increased competitiveness in business costs, commitment to our 12.5% corporate tax rate, transformation of client operations and activities, national Infrastructure development, Government's investment strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and development of growth markets will continue to attract and increase the level of inward investment in Ireland.New and established multinationals continue to invest and re-invest in their operations making Ireland one of the global locations of choice for mobile investment projects from the world's leading companies.  In 2009, IDA launched a major marketing campaign aimed at the North American market, which includes Canada.  As part of the marketing campaign, television (CNBC & Bloomberg), internet, newspaper and airport advertisements were placed, highlighting Ireland as an innovation hub with a population famed for its ability to respond in a creative manner to unique challenges and requirements.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21303	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	711	In 2010 my Department commissioned a study to   measure the information obligations arising for employers under Company Law, Employment Law and Health & Safety Law. The companies that took part in the survey outlined a number of areas in which information obligations posed the greatest difficulty.  These information obligations were then measured to identify the specific administrative burden cost of compliance.The overall administrative cost to employers in the Employment Law area was estimated at €71.4m, of which €61.5m was attributed exclusively to the record-keeping requirements under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. This requirement would be expected to be even more onerous for employers operating in sectors regulated by EROs/REAs, as the hours worked in these sectors must be further identified if they occur on Sundays, during unsocial hours, during non-rostered times or overtime hours.  My Department is currently working on proposals to alleviate the burden that the record-keeping requirement under the Organisation of Working Time Act presents for compliant businesses.In addition, a number of the proposals contained in the Action Plan that I have proposed for radical reform of the JLC and REA mechanisms are aimed at simplifying the system in a way that would reduce the burden of supervision and compliance and also ensure a degree of coordination and oversight over the system so that necessary record-keeping requirements   are kept reasonable and proportionate across all sectors.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	715	The High Level Group on Business Regulation was set up in 2007 to provide a fast-track mechanism for business to communicate specific, concrete red tape issues to the Government and follow through on their implementation.  The Group works to identify the administrative burdens placed on businesses arising from regulation and to determine ways to reduce and simplify these burdens or eliminate them where they are unnecessary.  The Group focuses mainly on the burdens on small and medium sized enterprises.   To date, the Group has processed 48 red tape issues brought to its attention by business, and is continuing to seek practical solutions to a  further 20 issues.  Details of these 48 items at set out in Appendix A.  In addition to this work, the High Level Group was involved in validating the administrative burdens identified with my Department in 2009 and 2010 as part of the target to reduce administrative burdens by 25% by 2012.  My Department has already reduced measured burdens by 22%, or 90% of the target to be achieved, which represents an annual saving of almost €187 million for business.  Details follow at Appendix B.I expect I will be in a position to announce the initiatives that will make up the remaining 3% before the end of the year.  Some of these reductions are as yet potential savings.  Making them real savings requires businesses to adopt these newer, more simplified approaches that have been made available.  All firms are encouraged to ensure they gain the full benefit of this work by reading the guidelines provided, and adopting the low cost options.  There is no requirement for the High Level Group on Business Regulation to publish annual reports, although two reports have been published since 2007.  In the future, updates on the work of the High Level Group will be published via the Department's website.NoSuggestionStatusSavings1

When redesigned forms are complete it will seek the opinion of the High-level Group. It should be noted that in most cases the contents are not negotiable, in that CSO, on behalf of Ireland, is obliged to compile data (under EU law) to a strictly defined standard.Not measured8Revenue — technical adjustmentsRevenue should develop the concept of “technical adjustments” whereby tax can be paid late without penalty or interest in the case where a transaction has been handled incorrectly in errorProcessed — Revised Code of Practice published, effective from October 1st, 2010.A technical adjustment will not attract a penalty where Revenue is satisfied that due care has been taken by the taxpayer, and the treatment concerned was based on an interpretation of the law, which could reasonably have been considered to be correct.Not measured9Revenue — D/Finance — Withholding taxAbolish [Professional Services] withholding taxProcessed — not possibleNIL10Revenue — D/Finance — D/Justice — Sales/Retail LicencesReduce the administrative burden associated with these.With regard to the licensing of mineral oil, off-licences, wine and video, every year at renewal date the licence must be reapplied for and must be signed by the Company Secretary or Director.  It has been suggested that, in order to improve efficiency, the requirement to fill in new forms would only apply if some element of the licence changed. Furthermore, it has been suggested that licence periods should be increased to 3 or 5 yearsProcessed — Revenue’s role in relation to Excise Licenses is essentially administrative and, within the parameters of the existing law with effect from 29 June 2009, considerable streamlining has been applied to the Excise Licence application and renewal process.  These developments reduce the administrative burden associated with Excise Licence obligations for up to 40,000 licence holders. All licence renewal forms have an automatic Tax Clearance facility applied to them and it is also possible for licence holders to renew and pay for their licence using the Revenue On-line Service facility. These developments have considerably improved excise license processing efficiencies.  67% of liquor licenses were renewed in October 2010, the peak period for liquor license processing, compared to 47% in October 2008.Not measured11D/EHLG — Waste Collection PermitsNew regulations now allow waste collectors to apply for a single permit from one designated authority.Processed — being measuredBeing measured12D/EHLG — Business User ForumsSmall Business Forum Report recommended the establishment of a “Business Users Forum” in each Local Authority in order to improve consultation and responsiveness to businesses.  Have these been established?Processed — Each county/city council has established a Business Support Unit (or similar arrangement) to act as a point of contact for businesses to ensure co-ordinated response (e.g. planning, water and roads).County/City Councils have recently been asked to expand representation from the business sector (e.g. the local Chamber of Commerce, IBEC/Small Firms Association etc.) on the County/City Development Boards’ economic development subcommittees to enable them to act as Business Users Fora to improve consultation/responsiveness by local authorities and other relevant agencies to local businesses.Not measured13D/SFA — PRSI classes and GuidanceCombine PRSI and Tax data for employees:  PRSI classes should be simplified and clear guidance provided to employers; this should be combined with tax rates on the tax card.Processed — During 2010 a Steering Group, led by the Department of Finance, examined the universal social contribution proposal. The Steering Group discussions were informed by issues such as simplification of PRSI.

A number of guides and guidelines have already been produced — the various Safe Systems of Work Plans (SSWP); Codes of Practice under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005; further Guidelines, Checklists and a Toolkit for Small Business on the “Simple Safety” series.The BeSMART tool has also been produced which is likely to bring savings of at least €64m per annumBeSMART and other initiatives to save business €106m per annum22CSO Point of ContactEach Department should have a liaison officer as a point of contact with the CSO.The CSO DG has written to Government Departments. Nominations for Liaison Officers have been received.Not measured23CSO Quarterly Earnings SurveysReduce the administrative burdens associated with this activityThe Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey (EHECS) is the main quarterly survey on earnings and employment costs in businesses. The CSO plans to reduce the sample size of this survey. This will result in a reduction in the number of small enterprises included in the sample and will therefore reduce the overall burden on business. The reduced sample size came into effect from the Q2 2009 reference period.The CSO has worked with a number of payroll software providers in modifying their software to meet the requirements of the EHECS. The modified software enables businesses to automatically generate reports in response to the survey. Once the initial set-up has been done, use of this software should result in significant reductions in burden for businesses. The software is currently available from software providers.Not measured24CSO— Vehicle Destinations FormCSO form on vehicle destinations very onerousThe EU largely determines the data required. Given the increasing demands for spatial-transport data in general and freight data in particular it is very difficult to see any way of cutting back in this area.NIL25CSO — ASICSO: why is Annual Services Inquiry necessary in addition to quarterly surveysASI data collection is governed by a number of EU regulations.Further, a new overarching piece of legislation concerning structural business statistics has recently been passed by the European Council and should come into effect this year.  This legislation will increase the data demands that Ireland is required to provide to the European Commission and the European Central Bank.NIL26CSO — ProdcomProdCOM form does not take account of format in which data is heldRequirements of ProdCOM are defined by an EU Council Regulation.NIL27Revenue-Revenue WebsiteTechnical guidance available on the Revenue website should be time-stamped and obsolete content removedA new version of the website was launched in December 2008.  The new website has been designed to make accessing information and services as easy and intuitive as possible. Information and services are now gathered in logical clusters under the primary headings: Personal Tax; Business & Self Assessment; Tax Practitioners; Customs; Taxes & Duties; and Online Services. The content is extensively cross-referenced and navigation and search facilities have been substantially improved. Work is ongoing on the updating of duty and tax manuals.Not measured28Revenue-D/Finance-VAT Returns(i) Paying VAT on a monthly or two-monthly basis causes problems for firms’ cashflow.(ii) Revenue are the only people who always get paid; can Revenue allow more time;Dealing with this on a cash receipts basis is a simple solution(ii) Abolish VAT on an accruals basisRevenue(i) In 2007, Revenue introduced less frequent filing of VAT3 returns for small traders.  Cases whose annual VAT liability is €3,000 or less per annum, now file VAT3 returns twice a year.  Cases whose annual VAT liability is between €3,001 and €14,400 per annum, file VAT3 returns three times a year.  The changes currently benefit over 90,000 traders.  Revenue regularly reviews the VAT liability of cases, examines its customer base and transfers traders to the less frequent filing programme where eligibility criteria are met.(ii)  There are approximately 65% of traders currently accounting for VAT on the Cash Basis.  A person or business applying for VAT registration who wishes to use the Cash Basis rather than the Invoice Basis must apply at the time of registration, in writing, for permission.  Alternatively, application may be made to the local Revenue District subsequently, again in writing, to change from the Invoice Basis to the Cash Basis.  If a trader is found to be eligible for the Cash Basis he/she will be notified of the date from which the accounting procedures have changed. The trader will be liable to account for VAT on all cash received on and after the approved date of change, but will not have to account for sales for which he/she had already accounted while on the Invoice Basis.Revenue has recently reiterated its long-standing message to business that there should be an early and full engagement with Revenue when problems start to emerge in meeting tax payment obligations. Revenue’s approach to individuals and businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties is set out on our website www.revenue.ie
1. D/Finance(ii) Many small businesses already avail of the cash receipts basis of accounting for VAT.Anything that improves firms cashflow situation in relation to the payment of tax, disimproves the Exchequer’s cashflow situation.The proposal is already in place for many SMEs.  VAT is normally accounted for on the basis of invoices issued regardless of whether of not the trader has been paid for the supply in that period.  However, SMEs with an annual turnover of €1million or less can avail of the cash basis of accounting which provides traders with the option to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis. This means that the  trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is actually received.  The VAT cash accounting option assists a significant number of firms and focuses in particular on small firms in the critical area of cash flow.The manner and frequency of VAT returns is determined by EU VAT law, with which Ireland must comply. In this context, cash-basis accounting arrangement cannot be used to replace the normal VAT arrangements across the board.€5.4m29Revenue—VAT Issues (a)Existing compliance records should be recognised when VAT registration applications are made• The customer service standard that applies to VAT registration is 100% within 10 working days.• The standard for other registrations is 100% within 5 working days.• Issues regarding delays experienced are examined when raised with Revenue.Not measured30Revenue—VAT Issues (b)Simplification of the revenue system is necessary in some cases; e.g. S4A relief.  This relates to delays with the VAT registration process and possible inability to avail of S4A shiftThe Section 4A Relief referred to in the suggestion has been repealed.Not measured31Revenue—VAT Issues (c) The process for handling requests for tax registration and VAT numbers should be improved. Registrations applied for by accounting firms should be fast-tracked; account should be taken of due diligence already undertaken under money-laundering regulations, etcThe e-registration project has been deferred due to budgetary constraints.NIL32Revenue — Visits to Start-up BusinessesRevenue visits to start up businesses should be re-instatedRevenue cannot commit to visiting every new business.  However Revenue is willing to support new start-ups with information sessions, etc.  ROS marketing, District, and Collector General staff regularly attend conferences aimed at business groups (either organised by Irish Taxation Institute, Local Enterprise Groups, etc) in order to deliver our key message.  Revenue also supports and liaises with IPASS/Payroll clerks, MABS, Citizens’ Information, etc.Revenue regularly attends conferences (e.g. ITI and Local Enterprise Group, meets with agents, payroll association etc. Further, it has a stand at the Ploughing Championships every year that deals with a significant volume of enquiries.Not measured33Revenue — Reward for use of ROSCompanies should be rewarded for use of ROS.  There should be incentives for using the on-line tax system; e.g., by way of a one month extension• Phased implementation of mandatory e-filing commenced from 1 January 2009.• As an incentive to encourage the take up of ROS services, with effect from 1 January 2009 the dates for paying and filing RCT, PREM, VAT and CT via ROS have been extended to the 23rd day of the month (in comparison with paper filers which have filing dates of the 14th (RCT, PREM), 19th (VAT) and 21st (CT), respectively).Not measurable34Revenue-TariffsOral information by Revenue in respect of tariffs should be prohibited; only written information should be permittedStaff in Revenue’s Customs Division receive telephone queries on an ongoing basis and are generally in a position to give an opinion as to the correct classification based on the information provided by the trader.  This is a valuable customer service and is of considerable assistance to traders despite the fact that on rare occasions an opinion delivered in this way and without sight of the goods may prove to have been incorrect.  For this reason, it is standard practice to caution traders that this is not an appropriate mechanism where doubt exists or greater certainty is required.Where the classification is unclear or where a trader requires a greater degree of certainty as to their exposure to duty, there is a facility known as Binding Tariff Information (BTI).  The BTI process is explained on their website2
NIL35D/Finance-Revenue—Tax Clearance Certs Ensure that all public sector organisations accept online TCCsRevenue:In 2003, Revenue introduced a TCC on-line verification facility as a customer service initiative to expedite contract and payment processing by public bodies.  The facility allows public bodies and applicants to view a current TCC on line, with the permission of the applicant, through the use of a tax number and PIN number supplied by Revenue to the applicant.  Revenue issued a letter to all Government Departments in December 2007 to increase the awareness of the availability of the on-line TCC verification facility among public bodies.  In addition the TCC on-line application and on-line verification facility is prominently positioned on the home page of Revenue’s redesigned website.The e-Tenders website guidelines have now been revised to include information on the online verification system.D/Finance: Will further promote this measure in public procurement guidance.€300,00036D/EHLG—Risk-based Enforcement in the Waste SectorEnforcement should be risk-based.Under the implementation of the RMCEI-EU recommendation on inspections-local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement now carry out risk-based inspections.Not measured37D/EHLG-Coordination between Waste Sector RegulatorsThere should be better co-ordination between regulators across the whole waste sector.This is being done.Not measured38D/EHLG-EPATarget for Reduction of Administrative BurdensThe EPA should consider setting an overall target for reducing the regulatory burden on businesses in Ireland; as in Denmark and the UKTo be pursued by the High-Level Group, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EPA in the context of the overall Government 25% reduction target.Not measured39D/Transport— HGV Cordon PermitsHGV cordon permits in Dublin city must be applied for daily. Can this not be made weekly, monthly or annually? Often the vehicles using the cordon are making regular and frequent known trips to city centre retail premisesThe HGV Strategy has been very successful at reducing the number of HGVs in the city while still allowing city centre business to operate, at this point Dublin City Council would be reluctant to change the way the system operates, however, they are prepared to meet with any interested parties to discuss how the system could be made easier to use, while not compromising its effectiveness.Changes to the current system would undermine the policy objectives underpinning the HGV Cordon Permits system.Any further relaxation of administrative requirements in this area has the potential to run counter to the stated policy objectives of the HGV Management Strategy.NIL40D/Taoiseach—Regulatory Impact Assessments & Administrative BurdensRIAs are very important; they need proper attentionDFurther progress needs to be made in relation to RIA, in particular in relation to the issues of quality and publicationOngoing engagement with Departments through the RIA Network and through the RIA Helpdesk will help to address both quality and publication issues. Revised RIA Guidelines are available at http://www.betterregulation.ie/eng/Revised_RIA_Guidelines.pdf. Comments made by business and other stakeholders on published RIAs and queries as to why RIAs have not been published should also be effective in driving improvements.NIL41D/Transport—Road Haulage PermitsThe Road Safety Authority plans to introduce a centralised permit system for the movement of wide and long loadsThe Minister for Transport made new Regulations that came into operation on 4th May 2009. These Regulations introduce a streamlined permit system to be administered by An Garda Siochana for the movement of wide and long vehicles on the major interurban routes and to Cork, Ringaskiddy and Rosslare Ports.Not measured42D/SFA—Social Welfare(i) Claimants say they are being told not to take up jobs until social welfare paperwork, currently running 4 weeks behind schedule, is completed(ii) Form-filling around short-time is onerous; and employer normally ends up doing most of this work(iii) What are Directors’ rights as employees in cases of liquidation in regard to PRSI; can they claim redundancy?; this is a grey area; need a set of clear guidelines(i) Those who take up work before their jobseekers’ claim is processed will be paid any outstanding payments up to the date of the commencement of any period of employment.(ii) The requirement that an employer individually stamp weekly payment dockets for customers working on a casual or short-term basis has been removed.The number of forms to be completed has also been reduced.(iii) In relation to redundancy payments only those directors who have been insurable at Class A, i.e. employees of the company, will have redundancy entitlements.NIL43D/SFA—Short term working rulesShort-time working rules currently don’t allow people work 4 days; this should be allowedThe application of the jobseekers payment scheme conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis is being kept under review.NIL44D/ETE—Single WindowForfás and Jacobs & Associates have carried out a study of the administrative costs of importing and exporting in IrelandThe Forfas report concludes that the cost/benefit of proceeding with a single window does not support further action at present.  The study found that businesses consider the administration around importing and exporting to be relatively straightforward.NIL45D/EHLG—Widening the Scope of EnforcementThe scope of enforcement needs to be widened beyond regulated facilities and collection services if the perception of sham regulation or paper regulation is to be avoidedTo be kept under review.NIL46CSO—Reduction of EU requirementsNegotiate reduction in EU statistical requirements.This is not a realistic objective. The CSO already does all it can, in a European context, to influence the reduction of burdens on business.  Furthermore, national users are demanding the same broad data.NIL47D/ETE-Revenue—Redundancy Rebates Offset against Tax LiabilityAny employer who has made staff redundant could offset the 60% refund due to them against any tax liability which arises, whether PAYEConsider the addition of a tick-box on the original RP50 form, to authorise DETE to pay Revenue directlyUnder Redundancy legislation, a rebate is paid to the employer in instances where the employer has paid his employee(s) their statutory redundancy lump sum.  It is very important therefore that the paying authority, tangible evidence that the employer is in agreement with having the rebate cheque made out instead in favour of the Revenue Commissioners.  The only real evidence for this is a letter from the company.  Even if, in IT investment terms a tick box solution was possible, it is unlikely that this would provide sufficient cover legally as anyone could tick a box on a form.  There is also, quite apart from the issue of legal cover or that of IT investment involved, the fact that it is too late for the applications already in the system for which the offset option would be most at issue as these applications are already lodged. Overall, the requirement which was born out of a need to facilitate employers, of sending a letter and cc’ing this to Revenue, would not appear to be over-onerous.  Any counter measure to be developed — be that IT related or otherwise — would potentially work to the detriment of employers in terms of imposing further delays in the Redundancy processing area. Revenue Update 2010 Where a business/individual is awaiting a statutory redundancy rebate and has particular difficulties in meeting their tax obligations because of a delay in receiving the payment, Revenue has put in place an arrangement where the business/individual provides authorization for payment of redundancy rebate direct to Revenue.The Redundancy Rebate arrangements are available on Revenue’s Website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/collection/debt- management/redundancy-rebates.pdf.€1.2m48CSO—Revenue — VIESReduce (EU) VIES (VAT) frequency of returns.The VIES return has a critical part to play in the fight against VAT fraud.  The EU Council adopted a Directive, effective from 1 January 2010, which increases the frequency of some VIES returns, i.e. monthly returns are now required from a trader whose intra-Community supplies of goods in any quarter exceeds €100,000 (threshold will be €50,000 from 1 January 2012). Over 1,700 traders have changed from quarterly to monthly filing and the majority file electronically using Revenue’s On-line System (ROS).  Revenue is continuing to encourage those who file paper returns to file via ROS. In addition, there is a new requirement for a trader who supplies services to business customers in other Member States to file VIES returns on a quarterly basis from 1 January 2010.   The implementation of this requirement is progressing on time with over 600 traders currently registered.Not measured

I. No. 533 of 2010, (European Communities (Provision of Services) Regulations 2010) and S. I. No. 555, (European Communities (Court Orders for the Protection of Consumer Interests) Regulations, 2010). The Directive is not concerned specifically with casual trading but with the provision of services in general.  The service in the context of the Deputy's question is the regulation of casual trading by local authorities which results in the provision of casual trading licences to traders to sell goods in public places.On 17 December 2009, my Department issued a detailed notice to all 88 local authorities entitled to make by-laws under the Casual Trading Act 1995, outlining the obligations arising for them under the Services Directive.  This notice was drawn up in my Department following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General.  Arising from this notice, some local authorities raised issues in respect of their obligations under the Services Directive.  My Department is engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in an attempt to clarify these issues.  When these issues have been clarified, my Department will write to all 88 local authorities informing them of the position.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Áth Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 90 private transport operators.  Funding for the scheme was frozen by the previous Government at 2010 levels of expenditure as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and the 2011 Budget.  The Department, therefore, is not in a position to make payments in excess of that level of expenditure during 2011.The Department has written to all companies operating the free travel scheme and has had discussions with a number of them regarding the current position of the scheme and in order to try to minimise the impact of the cap on expenditure on our customers.  The Department has not proposed any changes to the operation of the scheme.  The Government is undertaking a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for all Departments.  All the schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection, including the free travel scheme, are being examined in that context.  The outcome of this review will inform the Department's decisions in relation to expenditure on schemes in 2012 and into the future.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours a fortnight or 19 hours a week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.The current number of families in receipt of FIS is 28,223.  A breakdown of this number by county is set out in the table that follows this reply.  Current data on those who may qualify for FIS but do not claim is unavailable as it cannot be derived from administrative data sources.  In the past, the ESRI has produced estimates that point to relatively low take-up of FIS, but it is not clear if this represents the up-to-date position.  In recent years, there has been a growth in the FIS claimload.  It is not apparent whether this reflects better take-up or simply a larger employment pool.  Recent work commissioned by the Department suggests that the take-up problem may have improved, partially because of initiatives to improve information and make the payment more attractive.CountyFamily Income SupplementRecipientsCarlow509Cavan584Clare711Cork2,959Donegal1,383Dublin6,470Galway1,343Kerry883Kildare1,070Kilkenny430Laois527Leitrim187Limerick1,290Longford396Louth1,063Mayo914Meath928Monaghan513Offaly580Roscommon418Sligo423Tipperary1,227Waterford938Westmeath617Wexford1,172Wicklow628Others60Total28,223

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	736	My Department operates a wide range of schemes under which a person may be entitled to receive a payment if they satisfy all of the various conditions for receipt of that payment. The conditions for receipt of a primary weekly payment, such as Disability Allowance or State Pension, typically include experiencing a prescribed contingency, such as unemployment, disability or old age, and satisfying either a means test or social insurance contribution test.In cases where a person satisfies the general conditions for more than one type of primary weekly payment in general they will be entitled to receive only one primary weekly payment. For example if a person has a disability and is aged 66 years or more, they will not receive both a disability and an old-age payment. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, a person who has a Widow's Pension and who becomes ill may be entitled to receive a reduced rate of Illness Benefit in addition to her Widow's Pension, if she also satisfies the conditions for receipt of Illness Benefit.  Increases in primary weekly payments may be paid in respect of a qualified adult dependant and any qualified child dependants.In addition to primary weekly payments, a person may be entitled to a monthly child benefit payment or an annual payment such as back to school clothing and footwear allowance, provided they satisfy the conditions for receipt of those payments.  In the case of some couples, all payments may be made to one member of the couple while, in the case of others, each member may be personally in receipt some payments but not all (child benefit is normally paid to a mother).In the light of this and the fact that individual payments are delivered across a range of computer systems, it is not possible to extract the data requested in respect of the largest payment issued to any one person in the State.  The average payment varies across the various schemes operated by the Department. The most typical rate paid to people of working age is €188 per week, while the most typical rate paid to people aged 66 years or more is €230.30 per week.The lowest rate of payment arises in cases where a person is in receipt of a means tested payment, such as Jobseeker's Allowance, and has means assessed against them, for example from part-time employment, spouse income or capital. The lowest rate of entitlement that can arise from the application of means test rules varies, depending on the particular payment type. For example, the lowest rate of payment made under the Jobseeker's Allowance scheme is €1 per week.

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.The annual intake of appeals has increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010, an increase of 18,362 (130.5%) and currently it appears that another 30,000 will be received in 2011. In an effort to reduce processing times, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to a 3 further full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the yearI am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals conducts its business under constant ongoing review and the processes are continuously being enhanced to achieve better outputs, in particular to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.In that regard  some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced Appeals Officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.

It is expected that in excess of 80% of customers entitled to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance in 2011 will automatically receive the allowance.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is paid in respect of eligible children between the ages of:2 and 17 years of age, andbetween the ages of 18 and 22, if in full time education.In order to qualify for an automated payment the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and the Department were satisfied that the household satisfied the means test for the scheme. The scheme commenced from the 1st June 2011 with the entitlement created based on the preceding weeks entitlement.  If the Department establishes that any person received a payment to which they were not entitled, the Department will seek to recover that amount in full.

For this reason, eligibility is at present confined to those on the live register for 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.  Persons already in employment or engaged in community employment are not eligible for these positions.  Eligible persons will be identified by the Department of Social Protection by applying the following conditions:A person must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months, andCurrently be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, andBe fully unemployed.This person (details supplied) does not meet the eligibility criteria at present. The operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, will be kept under review and will inform the evaluation process in due course.

The person concerned has been notified of the Appeals Officers decision.  Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  The legislation also provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in the case of the person concerned as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 7th July 2011 and the appeal will, in due course, be referred to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

She appealed this decision and in that context she was examined by another Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  In the light of this, it was decided to afford the person concerned an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal and to furnish any further medical evidence that she wished to submit in support of her appeal.  She did this and, at this stage, the Social Welfare Services have been requested to submit relevant documents to this office on her case.  On receipt of their response her appeal will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.

I understand that this dissatisfaction resulted from the lack of tourist footfall at the facility due to its location at a distance from the town centre.Vacation of the Ceardlann, which was completed in December 2010, cost in the region of €102,000 which consisted of:some €80,000 associated with obtaining vacant possession from tenants; andsome €22,000 associated with obtaining planning permission for the redevelopment of the Ceardlann as a mini-business park.In light of significant budgetary constraints, Údarás na Gaeltachta is not in a position to undertake the redevelopment of the Ceardlann.  However, the matter is being kept under review.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	763	My Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  In line with contractual obligations, services have been available in all of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) covered under the Scheme since October 2010.My Department has put in place robust monitoring arrangements to ensure that the NBS network delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  Performance delivery data, which is submitted to my Department by 3 on a monthly basis or as required, is critically analysed by independent technical consultants, Analysys Mason Ltd.The monitoring arrangements provide information on a wide range of key indicators including broadband availability in each cell of the network, actual contention and latency values.  Utilisation thresholds are set for each element of the network and upgrades of the network and its capacity are automatically triggered at contractually agreed levels of traffic to ensure that the quality of the broadband service is maintained.  In addition, a sample selection of customers is monitored for quality on a monthly basis.  Download and upload speeds are sampled at a number of locations monthly to ensure that minimum speeds are met or exceeded.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3 with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I can inform the Deputy that my Department has not licensed hydraulic fracturing in the Upper Shannon catchment area.  In February of this year, following an open competition, my Department awarded two year onshore Petroleum Licensing Options to two companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous or Lough Allen Basin.  The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity.  This potential had been identified in earlier exploration, but was not considered commercially viable at that time.  The Licensing Options specifically exclude exploration drilling but shallow geological sampling is permitted.Exploration activity under these authorisations is at an early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to an application for a follow-on exploration licences that would be required before exploration wells could be drilled.  In the event that hydraulic fracturing was envisaged as part of a possible future exploration or production programme, then that activity would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including an appropriate public consultation phase.My Department requires drilling operators to comply with best international practice when carrying out drilling operations both on and offshore Ireland.  This includes verification that all equipment, systems and procedures are in place to allow operations to proceed safely and without polluting the environment.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	765	Ireland's fiscal and non fiscal licensing terms for oil and gas exploration and production were last reviewed in 2007.  The review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland's licensing terms in comparison to other European countries that Ireland competes with for exploration investment.  The outcome of that review was the introduction of a profit resource rent tax of up to 15% on top of the 25% corporation tax rate that already applies.  The revised terms apply to exploration licences issued since 1st January 2007.While I will keep the licensing terms under review in light of relevant future developments, at this juncture I believe that my Department's focus should be on attracting a larger share of international exploration investment, to Ireland to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made.  I would of course be happy to engage with any Oireachtas Committee that might decide to consider this issue.  However, at this stage I have no plans for a moratorium on the issuing of petroleum exploration licences.

Bord Gáis Éireann has advised me that, as set out in its annual report, it has entered into Gas Supply Contracts with the Corrib partners with the aim of securing competitive supplies for Irish customers.  The terms and conditions of commercially negotiated contracts in place between Bord Gáis Éireann and third parties are strictly operational matters for the company and not publicly available.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	767	I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 to 286, inclusive, together.RTÉ is responsible for the rollout and operation of the Saorview TV network.  Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, sets out RTÉ's powers and responsibilities in this regard.  The Act provides that RTÉ must roll out a national digital TV network to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, I understand from RTÉ that the analogue network covers 98% of the population and the Saorview network will also provide 98% population coverage from 51 transmitter sites at or shortly after switch-off of the analogue signal, which is to take place in Quarter 4 of 2012.Information on the Saorview transmitter sites is available from RTÉ and its website —www.saorview.ie.  While I have no direct function in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy’s query to RTÉ and have asked the company to send him the detailed information that he is looking for as soon as practicable.  In addition, at this point, I can state that RTÉ has indicated that all 51 sites are now operational and currently provide coverage to 97% of the population.  Some of the transmitters closest to Northern Ireland are operating at lower powers to prevent interference into the UK (Northern Ireland) analogue TV network.  The power levels of these transmitters will be increased to full power at or shortly after analogue switch-off on the basis of a cross-Border co-ordinated approach agreed between the Irish and UK authorities.In relation to those areas that cannot be served by Saorview transmitters, I understand that RTÉ proposes to offer a ‘free to air' satellite service and that this is designed to reach the last 2% of the population.  The RTÉ decision to provide a satellite service is being made by RTÉ on a commercial basis.  RTÉ has indicated that this service in conjunction with the DTT network will provide coverage to virtually 100% of the population.  The satellite, which will be used to provide this service, launched in late 2010 and is currently undergoing tests.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 to 290, inclusive, together.The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) has been open for applications since 9th May last and will remain open until 29th July next.  An official notice regarding the launch of the Scheme was placed in the Government Notices section of the Irish Independent on the morning of the launch.  In addition, a Press Release was issued to all national and provincial newspapers and the launch of the scheme received prominent coverage on national and local radio.Prior to the Scheme's launch my Department spent a considerable time liaising and meeting with the various Regional and Local Authorities with a view to harnessing their collective network of local and community contacts to promulgate the message about the RBS within their respective areas.  I am happy to report that this approach has proven to be very positive with the various Authorities putting in place measures aimed at raising awareness in areas which they consider are most likely to benefit from the Scheme.  The approach taken has included arranging information meetings at community level, coverage by local media, links on websites, notices distributed to libraries and other local public offices and information distributed in community notices.  Representative bodies such as Irish Rural Link have also played an important role in raising public awareness of the scheme through their contacts at community and national level.  My Department will shortly be again engaging with the Regional Authorities as well as all members of the Oireachtas to further promote the scheme in advance of the closing date of the 29th of this month.With regard to the Deputy's questions concerning a minimum broadband speed threshold for applicants, the Scheme is open only to applicants in rural non-National Broadband Scheme areas who are unable to obtain a broadband service from a commercial operator.  EU State Aid rules prohibit the Scheme from including members of the public, who already have, or are capable of having, a broadband service from a commercial operator.There are procedures in place for situations where broadband subscribers have complaints or issues relating to the quality and/or consistency of the service they are receiving.  They should raise these formally with their Service Provider in the first instance and, where this does not lead to a resolution of the problem, refer the matter to ComReg, the independent regulator for the sector.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	769	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy programme on behalf of my Department.  The energy poverty strand of Better Energy aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low-income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures.  An additional €10 million was provided for low-income housing retrofits in the recent Jobs Initiative.  This will enable over 20,000 low-income homes to benefit from energy efficiency retrofit measures this year.There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the scheme over the last three years.  The success of the scheme in 2010 has led to increased awareness and demand, and a subsequent increase in waiting times.  This has resulted in SEAI having to prioritise lower cost measures in homes, in order to secure and address the maximum number of vulnerable homes this year.Surveys were carried out on eligible homes and homeowners were informed of measures that their homes may be suitable to receive.  Correspondence will issue shortly from the SEAI to clarify the measures currently available to applicants.  The SEAI is currently working with community based organisations (CBOs) and private contractors to prioritise delivery in the coming months to those homes which have been waiting for the longest period, subject to budgetary availability.  Queries in relation to individual applications can be addressed to the SEAI hot line — 1800 250 204 where all queries from scheme applicants and public representatives are dealt with immediately.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	770	As the Deputy will be aware, the performance of salmon rivers is assessed on an annual basis by the Salmon Standing Scientific Committee (SSC).  The estimated number of one-sea-winter adult salmon spawners in the River Suir from 2005 to 2010 is described in the annual assessments of the SSC.  Copies of the annual reports are available on the Department's website.  The estimate for 2005 was 9,000; 2006 — 9,900; 2007 — 17,400; 2008 — 17,500; and 2009 — 15,000.  These annual estimates indicated that the average over 5 years was less than the conservation limit requirement of 15,771 and so no harvest was permissible.  In 2010 the estimated number of spawners was 18,281, resulting in the specification of a total allowable catch for the current 2011 season of 1,473 fish for the River.The Suir Estuary forms part of the Waterford Estuary, into which the Nore and Barrow Rivers also flow.  I understand that stocks in the River Nore demonstrated a recovery with a growing surplus identified since 2009.  The salmon stock in the River Barrow, I am informed however, continues to be below its conservation limit.  Approval was given for the conduct of a survey, by inland Fisheries Ireland and the Waterford Estuary Fisherman's Association, in Waterford estuary in 2010.  The main objectives of the survey were stated as:1. To determine genetically the current extent of Irish river of origin salmon captured in Waterford estuary and to also determine the presence, if any, of salmon from other countries in the estuary.2. To capture salmon over an extended period in summer and autumn to determine river of origin by genetic analysis within the Barrow / Nore / Suir river complex to provide a qualitative assessment of salmon stock abundance on the river Barrow where no stock estimate is currently available.I await a report on the outcome of the survey.In the future event that stocks are shown to recover in each of the rivers of the Waterford Estuary, and it is established from the results of Genetic Stock Identification that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted within the rivers and estuary, it should be possible to exploit the identified surplus within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive as transposed by the European Communities (National Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 94 of 1997).

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services.  The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of market failure.  Such interventions, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the recently-launched Rural Broadband Scheme, are subject to State Aid clearance by the EU Commission.  Accordingly, the State, when it does intervene in the competitive market, is prohibited from doing so in served areas where it would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.Between the significant private and public sector investments over recent years there is now a situation where all areas of the country have access to at least a basic broadband service.  I am aware however, that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that are not currently capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The Rural Broadband Scheme, which is currently open for applications, aims to identify the remaining individual premises in rural Ireland, including county Laois, outside of the NBS areas that are unable to obtain a broadband service and to provide a basic broadband service to those premises, where requested.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme is available on my Department's website (www.dcenr.ie) or through contacting my Department on lo-call 1850 678100.  In addition, under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.I recently convened a meeting of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair.  The Taskforce comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  Its purpose is to discuss how best to deliver the optimal policy environment and to identify a road map for the speedy delivery of high speed broadband across Ireland.  The Taskforce will consider issues such as appropriate targets, investment plans, and the role of Government policy and actions in driving and facilitating investment.  I expect that the NGBT will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.

Strong, vibrant rural communities are essential to the well-being of the entire country.  The Community Division within my Department was established to promote and support the sustainable and inclusive development of communities — both urban and rural.It has responsibility for a range of programmes and schemes targeting community, local and rural development, designed to tackle issues such as depopulation, deprivation and social isolation.  Details of all these schemes can be found on my Department's website www.environ.ie.  In addition, Ireland’s Rural Development Programme 2007 -2013 represents substantial investment in our rural areas and the agriculture sector. This programme includes investment of €427m, which is 55% co-funded by the EU, towards improving the quality of life in rural areas and diversifying the rural economy. This investment is being rolled out through the network of local development companies who are implementing the various measures under the programme.  General post office network issues, including the closure of post offices, are a matter for the management and board of An Post.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The charge is levied on a fixed liability date in each calendar year and payment becomes due two months after that date.  There is then a further month's grace period to pay the charge, giving a total of three months during which the charge may be paid before penalties for late payment commence.  Given this length of time and the relatively modest nature of the charge, it is not considered that an instalment payment plan is merited in this case.The Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority, and interpretation and implementation of the legislation is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance.  I have no plans to amend the payment arrangements with regard to the charge on non-principal private residences at present.

It goes on to exempt certain properties and owners from the charge, the most significant exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.In a case where a person owns a property in which he or she does not live and his or her sole or main residence is a rented property, there would be a liability for the charge in respect of the property owned by the person unless it is otherwise exempt under the provisions of the Act.  The Act does not seek to differentiate between such residences left vacant by the owner or made available for rent as the case may be.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I am not aware of the practice as outlined in the Question.  Local authorities are committed to the delivery of a quality service to public representatives and the public in general, including in relation to access to information.  It is a matter in the first instance for each local authority to keep under review its own systems and procedures with a view to improving standards of service and addressing any deficiencies which may come to light at local level.In the context of the ending of the dual mandate, local authorities are required under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 to put in place arrangements to provide, inter alia, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas members by the local authority such as the local authority budget, draft development plan, etc.  Local authorities are also required to deal with requests for access to information by a parliamentary representative as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with a proper level of customer service.  In this regard, local authorities are obliged to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.My Department has gathered information from local authorities on a periodic basis, on the practical application of the arrangements established by the above Regulations.  Based on the information received, I understand that local authorities are generally complying with these arrangements. I will, however, continue to monitor compliance by local authorities in this regard.  In all of this, local authorities, as public bodies, are obliged to comply with the Data Protection Act 1988 as amended and any associated Regulations.  Consequently great care must be taken in ensuring that personal information is not released in contravention of this legislation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	779	RAPID operates in 51 areas nationally of which nine are within or partially within the area administered by Dublin City Council.  It is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with regard to projects under their responsibility within the different RAPID areas.My Department administers the RAPID Leverage Schemes, which are designed to support small scale projects identified locally by Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. These schemes are co-funded by relevant agencies and the schemes support projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities and the provision of playgrounds.Funding of €3.16m is being provided in my Department's Vote in 2011 to support a number of projects under the leverage schemes. This funding is being used to meet outstanding commitments, and new applications are therefore not being accepted at present. While I am continuing to give priority to social inclusion programmes administered by my Department, it will be necessary to ensure that there is enhanced coordination and efficiencies are achieved in relation to social inclusion initiatives into the future, including RAPID.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to complete ratification of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.  Delivering on this commitment by addressing the remaining legislative requirements to allow ratification to proceed is a high priority for the Government.The three pillars of the Convention are partially implemented in EU law by two Directives. The first of these deals with public access to environmental information and was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007.  The second, known as the Public Participation Directive, deals with public participation in decision making and access to justice. Several pieces of legislation have been used to transpose the Public Participation Directive, including:Section 33 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010;the European Communities (Public Participation) Regulations 2010;the Environmental Protection Agency (Amendment) Regulations 2010;the Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010; andthe Aquaculture (Licence Application) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2010.The effect of the measures taken to transpose these two Directives is that Ireland is largely compliant with the provisions of the Convention. The Office of the Attorney General has, however, advised that a number of further measures are still required before the ratification process can be completed. The drafting of the necessary legislation is at an advanced stage, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and it is my intention to include these provisions in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being progressed through the Oireachtas.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	781	I refer to the reply to Question No. 229 of 31 May 2011.  My Department issued Wind Energy Development Guidelines in June 2006.  A copy of the Guidelines is available on my Department's website www.environ.ie.These Guidelines recommend an approach which seeks to identify, within the development plan process, key areas where wind energy resources are good and capable of being exploited. Chapter 6 in the Guidelines comprehensively addresses considerations relating to the siting and design of wind farms to ensure the highest standards are applied in particular where landscape sensitivity is high as in scenic areas, natural heritage areas or special protection areas.Planning authorities are required to undertake a statutory public consultation process when making or varying a development plan.  This allows all stakeholders and interested parties the opportunity to make submissions while plans are at draft stage and before their adoption by the relevant planning authority.  It is also open to individuals to make an observation or lodge an objection in relation to an individual planning application for development, including a wind energy development.  My Department's guidelines, in addition, recommend that planning authorities encourage wind farm developers to engage in active consultation and dialogue with local communities at an early stage in the development consent process.

British Citizens may vote at Dáil, European Parliament and local elections.  Irish Citizens alone are entitled to vote in Presidential elections and referendums.  While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to extend the current arrangements for voting by non-Irish citizens.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	784	Regarding the reference to burdens on the retail sector, I assume that the Question is referring to the Environmental Management Costs (EMCs) that consumers have paid to producers when purchasing certain electrical items since the introduction of the WEEE Regulations in Ireland, and which will continue in place until they are discontinued in February 2013.  This system of EMCs was put in place to provide funds for the recovery and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) that was placed on the market prior to the introduction of the WEEE Regulations.  The recovery and recycling of EEE that was placed on the market after that time (August 2005) must be funded by producers as part of their normal business costs.  Retailers were entitled to retain a percentage of all EMCs collected for producers at the point of sale of items to consumers, under a voluntary scheme agreed between all the parties, principally to compensate them for the costs of setting up the system initially.The level of EMCs for each category of electrical items is set by the independent WEEE Register Society and there are currently EMCs remaining in just one category — large household appliances. Some of the factors that the WEEE Register Society takes account of when setting the EMCs are the costs of recovery and recycling and the levels of financial reserves which the approved WEEE schemes (WEEE Ireland and ERP Ireland) have in place; EMCs have been reduced year on year since 2005.  It should be noted that retailers, through EMCs, have been compensated since 2005 for their participation in the WEEE regime. They have benefited from the receipt of these charges even though the return of WEEE to retailers was, in some case, presumably relatively low given the level of new apartments and houses which were being equipped in the years following the introduction of the Regulations.The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment regime in Ireland is underpinned by a legal framework which is very specific in relation to the obligations of retailers and they have played a very important role in ensuring that Ireland has met its WEEE recovery and recycling targets as set by the WEEE Directive, most importantly through their requirement to take back WEEE from consumers on a one for one, like for like basis.While I am cognisant of the financial difficulties currently faced by retailers, I wish to make it clear that they must, like all sectors of society, comply with their legislative requirements even in these challenging economic times.  Incidents of leakage of WEEE from retailers' premises have been brought to my Department's attention and the Environmental Protection Agency is currently investigating this matter; I hope, however, that these are isolated incidents. I understand that proposals for a new compensation scheme are being discussed by retailers with producers and my Department will continue to engage with all parties on this issue. I would expect, that any such proposal would improve the collection, reuse and recycling of WEEE in Ireland and should not merely be compensation for complying with what is already required under existing legislation.

It exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.Section 4(6) of the Act includes an exemption for property in which a relative of the owner is living rent-free, as long as that residence is on the same property or within two kilometres of the owner's main residence.  This provision was intended principally to cater for situations in which accommodation might be provided for an elderly parent by a son or daughter, and follows precedent from Revenue legislation dealing with the home carer tax credit.

Following detailed consideration of the analysis and findings, my Department will shortly be communicating further with the European Commission Services to discuss the matter.  As the Forfás study is the subject of ongoing deliberation and consultation with the Commission Services, it would not be appropriate to detail its contents at this point.  However, I intend to publish the report simultaneously with the publication of a consultation draft of revised Retail Planning Guidelines which is currently under preparation in my Department and is expected to be published in the Autumn.

I am informed by the Chairman of the Tribunal that the existing arrangements are designed to ensure that the confidentiality provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 are fully respected.As the Deputy may be aware, I recently restored the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 to the Dáil Order Paper. I am currently considering a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage, and in that regard I intend to introduce an amendment to widen access to Tribunal decisions while at the same time ensuring that applicants can rely on their identities remaining confidential.

In that context, all claims involving Garda vehicles are handled by the State Claims Agency.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 315 together.I attach the highest priority to the fullest investigation of white collar crime and making the perpetrators of such crime amenable for their crimes.  I have expressed, both before and since my appointment as Minister, my unhappiness with the protracted nature of the investigations.  In so doing, I am not criticising those carrying out the investigations.  It is clear that the complexities of the matters being investigated create tough challenges for investigators and prosecutors.There is extremely close co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) in the investigation of such crime.  Immediately after I took up office, I sought and was given assurances that there are sufficient resources available to such investigations.  I have made it clear to those involved that if at any stage they believe that additional resources are required that will be responded to immediately.It was in the light of my concerns that, on taking office, I gave priority to the introduction of the Criminal Justice Bill 2011, currently at an advanced stage before the House.  It is my intention that the Bill's provisions will speed up investigations and prosecutions in this area, both future investigations and those currently underway, by improving a number of important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.The Director of Public Prosecutions is, of course, independent in the performance of his duties.  It would therefore be inappropriate for me to enquire as to the status of his consideration of investigation files submitted to him for decision.  I note however that he has welcomed my decision to introduce the Criminal Justice Bill.   In his view, until now it has been a surprising omission in Irish law that potential witnesses cannot be compelled to cooperate with an investigation, even where they themselves are not suspected of or accused of any wrongdoing.  In this regard it is his view that the power of an Irish criminal investigator is considerably weaker than that of a tribunal of enquiry and that the new legislation would plug this gap.

The Garda Commissioner, who has responsibility for determining the range of powers and duties of the Garda Reserve under section 15(5) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, has established a review and I look forward to its outcome.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	794	The term cyberbullying refers to bullying carried out using the internet, mobile phones or other technological devices. Cyberbullying is a complex issue which transcends the home or school environment. Cyberbullying generally takes a psychological rather than physical form but is often part of a wider pattern of "traditional" bullying.Specifically in relation to social networking websites, the first thing anyone should do if they have issues with content on a Social Networking Site is to report the matter to the website. A person can use the website reporting tools to do this and should also contact the service provider through its Customer Care or Report Abuse facility. In February 2009, the Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU were adopted on a voluntary basis by the major social networking website operators in the EU, in an initiative lead by the EU Commission. The Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU were developed to provide good practice recommendations for social networking providers to enhance the safety of children and young people using these services. The Principles provide that social networking services should, inter alia, provide a mechanism for reporting inappropriate content, respond to notifications of illegal or inappropriate content or conduct and should review their systems for examining and responding to such reports. The EU Commission has indicated that it will monitor the implementation of the Principles on an ongoing basis.I should also inform the Deputy of the Safer Internet Ireland project, which is coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) in my Department. This project, which is funded by the EU's Safer Internet Programme, comprises a consortium of industry, education, child welfare and government partners that acts as a Safer Internet Centre to provide Safer Internet awareness, hotline and helpline functions and activities for the Republic of Ireland.  The main aim of the project is to develop national initiatives promoting the safer use of electronic media and enhance protection of the vulnerable, particularly children and young people, against the downside of the internet. The Office for Internet Safety has published a number of relevant information guides which have been widely disseminated, including "A Parents Guide to Social Networking Sites" and "A Guide to Cyberbullying".As part of the Safer Internet Ireland project, the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), an Agency of the Department of Education and Skills, manages the Webwise initiative (www.webwise.ie) which is the Irish Internet Safety Awareness Centre. Webwise provides parents, teachers and children with educational resources, advice and information about potential dangers on the internet and empowers users to minimise or avoid these risks. The NCTE also operates the www.watchyourspace.ie website which provides advice for young people on how to manage their online activities to avoid problems. The ISPCC’s Childline service receives funding from the Safer Internet Ireland project to support it in responding to contact from young people who may have encountered difficulties in their use of the internet and other technologies, including issues such as cyberbullying. Another element of the Safer Internet Ireland project involves funding to the National Parents Council (Primary) which operates a national confidential helpline for parents providing information and support to parents if their children encounter issues on the internet, particularly cyberbullying.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The Garda Síochána Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit, operating within the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, is responsible for the investigation of criminal offences involving child pornography.  The Unit contains trained specialists and can be augmented by personnel from other units of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation if required.I am informed by the Garda authorities that any suspected offence involving the abuse of children through the internet or other technology, whether originating in this jurisdiction or coming to the attention of An Garda Síochána through international agencies or by any other means, is subject to thorough investigation and cooperation by An Garda Síochána.  Specialist computer software is available to An Garda Síochána and is utilised to gather information and intelligence on possible suspects operating in this jurisdiction.  The resources available for the investigation of this type of crime are continually monitored by the Garda authorities, and I am informed that they are currently considered to be sufficient.The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 provides penalties for child pornography offences which I consider to be robust.  The offence of knowingly possessing child pornography attracts a maximum prison sentence of five years or a maximum fine of €6,350 or both.  The maximum penalty for knowingly producing, distributing, printing, publishing, importing, exporting, showing or selling child pornography is a maximum prison sentence of 14 years or an unlimited fine or both.The internet is a worldwide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  There is, however, an existing  self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in operation in Ireland which actively encourages  the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public may report such material to the www.hotline.ie service of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Ireland (ISPAI).  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law,  ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the internet hotline in that jurisdiction and/or to the relevant law enforcement agencies for follow up, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.It might be noted that a draft proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was published last year by the European Commission and is currently being negotiated by the EU institutions.  Ireland's participation in the adoption and implementation of this measure has been approved by the Government and the Oireachtas.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	797	I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question 15254/11 which was put down for answer on Wednesday 15 June 2011.  The position remains unchanged and consideration is being given to the issue of the circumstances which may effect a change to the upper age limit for entry to An Garda Síochána.Recruitment to An Garda Síochána is governed by Statutory Regulations, namely the Garda Síochána (Admission & Appointments) Regulations 1988/2005. The recruitment age was considered as recently as 2004 when, on the recommendation of the Garda Commissioner, the maximum recruitment age was increased from 26 to 35 years.  This upper age limit of 35 was set having regard to equality legislation and also took into account the following criteria:(1) The cost of training(2) The need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost.(3) The operational requirements of the service in terms of having an age profile appropriate to the physical demands placed on members in the course of their duty.  Consideration is being given to changing the upper age limit, in limited circumstances, in a way which would be beneficial to An Garda Síochána. The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 already allow the Public Appointments Service to give due recognition to any satisfactory service by a person as a reserve member of the Garda Síochána.

Garda management is aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM).  I am advised by the Commissioner that this model provides a scientific, rational and pragmatic aid in the distribution on Garda personnel.  The model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and takes into account a number of factors including workload, population, response times, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	801	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's question was received in the Citizenship section of my Department in July 2008.  My predecessor considered the application in February, 2011 and decided to defer making a final decision in this case until mid 2012. The person concerned was notified of this position and the reasons for it.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	802	Law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products and the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  In tackling this trade, the strategy employed by Revenue Commissioners includes not only interception measures at points of importation, but also the targeting of this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. Revenue enforcement officers also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in 2010, 41 convictions were secured under the Finance Acts by the Revenue Commissioners for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products with total fines of €107,750 and 7 custodial sentences and 2 community service orders imposed. A majority of the offences in question related to sales of illicit tobacco product at inland markets.  Furthermore in 2011 to date, 19 convictions for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products were secured by the Revenue Commissioners with total fines of  €48,200 and 2 custodial sentences being imposed.The Revenue Commissioners are fully supported in this area of work by An Garda Síochána. Searches are regularly undertaken by members of An Garda Síochána, as part of intelligence-led operations led by Revenue, which have resulted in significant seizures of cigarettes. Apart from the high profile seizures, An Garda Síochána also continue on a District and Divisional basis to target those involved in the sale and distribution of illegal products, at markets and via door-to-door sales.  Finally I can assure the Deputy that tackling this form of criminality remains a priority for our law enforcement agencies.

The local Superintendent considered the person could not, without danger to public safety and security, be permitted to have the firearms in his possession.

In this context, "Peace Officer" includes a member of An Garda Síochána as well as other emergency workers.Persons found guilty of offences under that act are liable on summary conviction to a Class A fine (not exceeding €5,000) and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. The penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine determined by the Court or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years, or both.  The situation will be kept under review and I will have no hesitation in bringing forward proposals for additional sanctions if the need arises. I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the number of reported assaults against Peace Officers was 249 in 2010 and 150 to date in 2011.

The Deputy may recall that I referred to concerns of Judge Smithwick during my contribution in the Dáil when the relevant motion was being debated.  I indicated then that I would place copies of the correspondence in the Dáil library when it had been concluded.  This was done.As stated in my reply to the Deputy to his Question No. 155 of 22 June 2011, I spoke with the Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson, and with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to inform them of the content of my speech in Dáil Éireann relating to the Smithwick Tribunal and the motion passed by the Dáil on 1 June 2011.

In common with armies throughout the world, desertion from the Irish Defence Forces is regarded as a very serious offence.  This was especially the case at a time when the world was at war and our troops were on standby to defend our country from invasion.  In any consideration of the matter, we must also bear in mind the principle that such decisions cannot be left to the individual discretion of individual soldiers on active service and all soldiers must accept that there are consequences for desertion.Members of the Defence Forces who served during the "Emergency" were engaged in important service for their country and it is crucial that no decisions are made that would in any way diminish or undervalue their loyalty to the State and the service given by them to the State.  However, I accept that many of those who deserted, went on to fight against fascism in World War II and did so out of a sense of idealism and with a commitment to protect democracies from tyranny and totalitarianism.  Had there been a different outcome to World War II there is no reason to believe that this State would have been immune to invasion.  I am giving active consideration to the matter raised by the Deputy.

Chapter 2 sets out in detail the procedures that shall be used where an officer of the Permanent Defence Force, thinking himself or herself wronged in any matter by any superior or other officer, including his/her Commanding Officer, seeks redress under section 114(1) of the Defence Act 1954 or where an enlisted member of the Permanent Defence Force, thinking himself or herself wronged in any matter by any officer or by any enlisted person, seeks redress under Section 114(2) of the Defence Act 1954.  Chapter 1 of Administrative Instruction A7 deals with Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces and outlines the Defence Forces policy and procedures in dealing with sexual harassment, harassment and bullying. Chapter 1 also outlines complaints procedures that are available to an individual (both formal and informal methods by which to bring a complaint).The military authorities advise that making a complaint under Chapter 1 of Administrative Instruction A7 does not mean that an individual is making a complaint under Section 114 of the Defence Act.  However, at all stages an individual has the option of complaining under section 114 of the Act through the procedures outlined in Chapter 2 of Admin Instruction A7.  The military authorities advise that all complaints submitted under Section 114 of the Defence Act are dealt with under Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7.

In 2011, the Defence Organisation, like all areas of the public service, is operating on a reduced budget. The Programme for Government also sets out a target for further fiscal consolidation over the period to 2015.I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 30 June 2011, the latest date for which figures are available, was 9,595 comprising 7,802 Army, 785 Air Corps and 1,008 Naval Service personnel. In the context of the Employment Control Framework and the available resource envelope, the Military Authorities and officials of the Department are now in the process of agreeing a re-structuring of the Permanent Defence Force to ensure its capability to meet the roles assigned to it by Government. The appropriate numbers required by rank in the Naval Services and Air Corps and the number of vacancies to be filled have yet to be determined as part of these discussions.Overall numbers in the Permanent Defence Force, including numbers serving at various ranks, and those serving in each branch, will be subject to ongoing control and monitoring on a monthly basis. This is to ensure compliance within the overall parameters and controls set by Government for each sector. The ECF also sets out that it will be necessary to underpin the re-organisation with the required amendments to Regulations and Administrative Instructions.  The Government's decisions arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure will further inform the resource envelope available for Defence over the coming years and the priorities within Defence.

Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force was suspended in late 2008 pending a review of the best means by which to achieve the reduction of 3% in payroll costs that had been applied, in common with other areas of the public service, to the Defence Forces.  The present position is that, within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Defence Forces.  To this end, targeted recruitment was carried out in 2010 and 2011 based on a competition initiated in 2010.  All previous applications for recruitment within the system had been terminated at the end of 2009 and applicants were advised accordingly.The Military Authorities have advised that to the end of June 2011 a total of 277 General Service Recruits have been enlisted.  There are no plans for further general service recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force at this time.  There will be an intake of 30 cadets from the Cadetship Competition in 2011 and a number of technical appointments will also be filled.  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The reason for maintaining a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is to protect public health. This is based on strong advice from both food safety and public health professionals. There have been very serious health issues associated with the drinking of raw milk in Ireland and in a number of other countries.The introduction of S.I. No. 910 of 2005 to implement the EU Food and Feed Hygiene Regulations in 2006 had the effect of removing the existing legal basis for the prohibition of the sale of raw cows milk for direct human consumption under S.I. No. 9 of 1996. Consideration was then given to extending the ban to cover goats and sheep milk. A consultation process was held during 2008 to determine public views on the proposal to extend the ban to include goats and sheep milk. Seventeen responses were received. Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.While public health is the overriding consideration, it is also worth noting that legislation required to allow the sale of raw milk on a restricted basis would be much more complicated and would impose very significant extra cost on my Department in relation to oversight and enforcement. Failure to adequately oversee such high-risk business operations could result in serious national and international reputational risk, for instance in the event of an outbreak of TB being linked to the consumption of raw milk purchased from an establishment approved by the competent authority.It should be noted that the prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated. It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.  In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is fully justified. I do not propose to ban the sale of cheese or other products manufactured from raw milk, as the same risk to public health does not arise.Article 10 (8) of EU Regulation 853 of 2004 provides that a Member State may, of its own initiative and subject to the general provisions of the Treaty, maintain or establish national rules prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market within its territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption. Section 54 of the Health Act of 1947 (as amended by Section 25 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006) has been identified as the appropriate primary legislation for this purpose and the Department of Health has agreed to promote a Statutory Instrument under that Act on behalf of my Department. The latest indicative timeframe for the introduction of the S.I. is end 2011, which includes allowance for a 3-month EU notification period.

Ducks and eggs infected by Salmonella   Typhimurium are not fit for human consumption. Under Statutory Instrument No. 101 of 2008, the movement, sale or supply of poultry and/or eggs from affected premises is prohibited. My department does not operate a scheme of compensation for infected duck flocks.In 2010 my Department tested known commercial duck flocks for salmonella and a small number of these tested positive. On a strictly once off basis, and on the understanding that the outbreak was limited to these flocks, my Department agreed to a limited, ex-gratia payment as a contribution to the costs incurred by the relevant flock owners.  It was clear to all concerned that this payment was once off, that it was ex-gratia in nature, and that it did not signal the establishment of a scheme of compensation for any further infected flocks. In the current circumstances it will not be possible to extend this facility.Finally, as a result of this outbreak, my Department, in consultation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the IFA, devised Guidelines for Duck Table Egg Producers, which were circulated to all ‘commercial' flock owners. Operators in the sector have been advised that they should take the necessary steps to reduce the risks associated with disease outbreaks, by adhering strictly to these Guidelines and by carefully checking the source of any replacement stock and ensuring they are disease free.

For a number of years the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee has played a vital role in recommending management arrangements which contributed to the re-building of the stock and is a great success for the Irish fishing industry.  A representative of the Producer Organisations, the fishing co-operatives and of the processors were appointed to this Committee.Following on from revised polyvalent mackerel management and fleet policy arrangements implemented in 2010, it is appropriate that the management arrangements for all herring fisheries be reviewed. To this end, I requested proposals from the fishing industry on the matter, including form the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee. I have recently received these submissions and I will give them careful consideration. I intend to make a decision on the arrangements, which takes account of the views provided and the technicalities of the fisheries.  In that regard, I will take account of issues relating to pairing arrangements, including the submissions made and the practical and legal arrangements in place in relation to quota management and pairing arrangements.   Any new arrangement put in place will apply to the 2012 fishery.

Process products include enhanced local services to our farming clients and a more productive staff.  An important process by-product for the Exchequer is a staff surplus which is used, under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, to make further savings and enhance public services generally. Department staff in County Waterford can rely on this agreement which protects its employment and sets out agreed working arrangements including redeployment terms.

The next step in the process is that the applicant's approved forester would submit an application for approval to commence planting.  The granting of this second approval commits the Department, subject to the submission by the applicant of ownership and other necessary proofs, to pay for the planting when completed.  No such application has been received from the approved forester for the person named.  It is recommended that the person in question raise this matter with his approved forester.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The overall national strategy for dealing with TB includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme, the use of the gamma interferon test as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in problem herds and the depopulation of infected herds in some cases.These measures constitute an effective eradication programme, as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.65% last year and reactor numbers in 2010 were, at 20,211, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950's.  Reactor numbers and herd incidence have continued to fall in 2011.The eradication programme is scientifically based and my Department continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease. In this context, notwithstanding the fact that the existing programme has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine TB, my Department is examining whether changes to some of the testing arrangements could assist both in reducing the spread of disease from infected herds and improving the efficiency of the programme.Ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place and that disease is not spread from infected herds to clean herds are key factors in achieving the goal of eradication and my Department will continue to review and make changes to these elements of the programme as deemed necessary. Any changes will be made following consultation with the farming organisations.  I am very pleased with the reduction in the incidence of TB in recent years. It is essential that this improvement continues.

This matter has already been dealt with, on appeal, by my Department.  In the absence of new and substantive evidence to support the contention by the person named that he was a farmer in 1997, despite his statement to the contrary as part of his application, the decision to award him the non-farmer rate must stand.

My Department has made a number of contributions to the strategy including supporting the concept of educational initiatives to raise awareness among farmers and others on the benefits accruing from increased animal welfare standards. My Department also supports the view that a core component of the strategy should be the protection of the competitiveness of farmers while guaranteeing that existing animal welfare legislation is correctly enforced across Europe.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the provisions of the National Sheep Identification Scheme have recently been revised to provide for the introduction of Electronic tagging (EID).  These changes have been introduced following consultation with all stakeholders in the sheep sector including marts and farmers. In so far as possible and, consistent with EU law, any changes that have been introduced have taken account of what best suits Irish conditions.  In this regard,  I would remind the Deputy,  that for both the vast majority of Irish flockowners and of lambs there has been minimal changes in the move to the new system,  as lamb intended for slaughter and under 12 months of age remains exempt from EID.  Notwithstanding this, some 750,000 EID tag set have now been purchased and the sector, in general, is getting on with the use of this new technology, where required.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The reason for maintaining a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is to protect public health. This is based on strong advice from both food safety and public health professionals. There have been very serious health issues associated with the drinking of raw milk in Ireland and in a number of other countries.The introduction of S.I. No. 910 of 2005 to implement the EU Food and Feed Hygiene Regulations in 2006 had the effect of removing the existing legal basis for the prohibition of the sale of raw cows milk for direct human consumption under S.I. No. 9 of 1996. Consideration was then given to extending the ban to cover goats and sheep milk. A consultation process was held during 2008 to determine public views on the proposal to extend the ban to include goats and sheep milk. Seventeen responses were received. Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.While public health is the overriding consideration, it is also worth noting that legislation required to allow the sale of raw milk on a restricted basis would be much more complicated and would impose very significant extra cost on my Department in relation to oversight and enforcement. Failure to adequately oversee such high-risk business operations could result in serious national and international reputational risk, for instance in the event of an outbreak of TB being linked to the consumption of raw milk purchased from an establishment approved by the competent authority. It should be noted that the prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated. It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for human consumption is fully justified. I do not propose to ban the sale of cheese or other products manufactured from raw milk, as the same risk to public health does not arise.Article 10 (8) of EU Regulation 853 of 2004 provides that a Member State may, of its own initiative and subject to the general provisions of the Treaty, maintain or establish national rules prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market within its territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption. Section 54 of the Health Act of 1947 (as amended by Section 25 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006) has been identified as the appropriate primary legislation for this purpose and the Department of Health has agreed to promote a Statutory Instrument under that Act on behalf of my Department. The latest indicative timeframe for the introduction of the S.I. is end 2011, which includes allowance for a 3-month EU notification period.

A number of significant structural and legislative changes are key to effecting such reform.  This includes the establishment of a new agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE.Preliminary work on the establishment of the new child welfare and protection agency has been undertaken and this project will now be accelerated.  Issues which are being progressed include the legislative and governance arrangements necessary to underpin the establishment and operation of the agency.  My Department is also working closely with the National Director for Children and Families Service within the HSE on associated matters, including the need to disaggregate the existing resource base for children and family services from the HSE in advance of the establishment of the agency.  It is intended that there will be careful planning and preparation to facilitate as smooth a transition as possible to the new agency with suitable arrangements being put in place on an administrative basis prior to the assignment of operational responsibilities. Work is proceeding in relation to these matters and as further plans are developed details will be made available.

The legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, provides a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Any adoption from a Hague country must comply with the rules set out in the Hague Convention and with Irish law.All applicants for intercountry adoption must undergo a detailed statutory assessment process, which is undertaken by professional Social Workers, and must be approved by the Adoption Authority before a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt can be issued to them from the Authority.  According to information provided by the Adoption Authority, there have been no applications for registration of foreign adoptions from Belarus since 2007, when one application relating to an adoption effected in 2002 was made.Belarus has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Any applicant with a valid Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt who is undertaking an intercountry adoption should ensure the adoption complies fully with the Adoption Act, 2010 and the Hague Convention. Further information in this regard can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie).

In general most schools address the individual needs of these children without recourse to supplementary targeted resources. There is significant evidence from research, both in Ireland and elsewhere, that disadvantage associated with poverty assumes a multiplier effect and are exacerbated when large proportions of pupils in a school are from poor backgrounds (a ‘social context' effect).Schools and school clusters/communities are allocated supplementary resources and supports in accordance with their level of concentration of disadvantage under the Department of Education and Skills' Schools Support Programme under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion.  The National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for the School Completion Programme and Home School Community Liaison, which are major components of DEIS transferred to my Department with effect from 2 June 2011.The majority of the 692 schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme (SCP) operate meal provision as part of after school clubs and homework clubs. These measures are considered to be key elements of the supports provided by 124 School Completion Programme projects throughout Ireland.In addition to funding provided through the School Completion Programme, the provision of school meals is primarily funded by the School Meals Programme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection which is strictly for food items only. The School Meals Programme aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving. In 2010, expenditure by the Department of Social Protection on the School Meals Programme was €30.96m and the budget allocation for 2011 is €35m.Educational research has shown that good nutrition improves concentration levels of students and that students from low-income families are less likely to have access to an adequate diet. Providing nutritional meals for the most marginalised children and young people is a core function of breakfast and most homework clubs under SCP, however, the social aspect of such clubs cannot be overestimated.After school supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of children and young people, which aim to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into their many talents. Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork and Sport enable children and young people to develop a range of creative and sporting skills. These activities help to boost self-esteem, have positive consequences for the classroom and are particularly important for academically weaker students. Parents are also encouraged to become involved to help out in homework clubs.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I propose to take Questions Nos. 377 to 381, inclusive, together.In the area of youth, my Department has a specific role in providing youth facilities and in supporting and promoting non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people in out-of-school settings through which they can enhance their personal and social skills and competencies.  Particular regard is had to the needs of young people between the ages of 10 and 21, and to those who are socially or economically disadvantaged including early school-leavers, homeless youth and those who are unemployed or at risk of substance misuse.In 2011, my Department is making a total of €62.45m available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people by the voluntary youth work sector as well as the provision of a range of sport and recreational facilities and youth cafés. Youth work programmes and services are delivered to over 1.2m participants in the various programmes by some 1,100 youth work staff and by a volunteer base of over 62,000.In particular, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides targeted supports to disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  Universal supports are also made available to all young people via the Youth Service Grant Scheme, Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by Léargas — The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce — the President's Award.  These measures are providing positive developmental opportunities for young people, enhancing their personal and social competencies, increasing social inclusion and social integration and improving school attendance and re-engagement with the formal education process.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The 2011 budget allocation for the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department is €60.154 million on current expenditure and €800,000 on capital expenditure. This capital expenditure is provided under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund for youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities,  in 22 disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Since the Fund was set up in 1998, over €68m has been allocated to 230 capital projects including the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of youth and community facilities.The current funding provided by my Department supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector and is allocated across all counties. Some €600,000  has been allocated to Kildare Youth Services in 2011 for six youth projects under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme. These provide a range of programmes and services which are addressing local needs of young people such as social isolation, substance misuse and early school-leaving.  In addition, my Department is providing over €50,000 to Co. Kildare VEC in 2011 to support volunteer-led youth clubs in the county under the Local Youth Club Grants Scheme.

As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children's outcomes is a key objective. Studies undertaken by my Department, such as the longitudinal study of children in Ireland and the biennial State of the Nation’s Children  analysis have an important contribution to make to our understanding of the issues that impact on children’s lives.This ongoing research and the evaluation results of pilot projects to enhance children's development, such as those that are underway in Tallaght, Northside and Ballymun, jointly funded by my Department with a philanthropic organisation, will shape the formulation of appropriate policy responses and services for children. My Department works closely with other Departments and agencies with shared objectives to better understand the issues that impact on children and families. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection  to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.My priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families. Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are important services to achieve this aim and are underpinned by solid evidence as to their effectiveness in enhancing children's opportunities for social and educational development and supporting parents. The network of 107 family resource centres and other services that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department, also have a role in this regard.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	855	The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme re-commenced the week beginning the 13th June. Approvals are being issued to those applicants processed to final stage in the chronological order in which they were received in the Central Office in Tullamore. The first 497 of these applicants have been dealt with. Funding is being assigned on a daily basis. There are approximately 600 further applications in progress and awaiting approval in July.The key focus of the Minister for Health is to ensure that those who require nursing home care will be able to access it and, to this end, the Department estimates that almost 24,000 people will be in long-term nursing home care by year end. This would mean a net increase of around 1,700 people by the end of the year.  In order to fund this increase, and to offset other pressures on the subhead such as increases in average length of stay, cost increases etc., the Minister identified a range of savings and income sources, one of which is a potential saving of up to €30 million in non-service related spending. This funding will come primarily from capital spending which is running significantly behind budget so far this year.  Finally, the Minister met with Nursing Homes Ireland, whose members account for over 70% of all long-term care beds nationally, on the 3rd June 2011 to discuss the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

The agencies are required to comply with my Department's Frameworks for Corporate and Financial Governance.  The Frameworks are supplementary  to statutory requirements and to Government approved guidelines including the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.
All Agencies meet their legal and financial obligations with regard to control, compliance and internal risk processes linked to their requirements to publish Audited Accounts.  Broader agency best practice relating to non-statutory governance provisions are in place to varying but increasingly improved standards.  Officials of my Department ensure that the Frameworks for health sector agencies is adhered to by monitoring progress on an ongoing basis.

The HSE's National Recruitment Service introduced a centralised recruitment system for staff grade physiotherapists in 2008.  Information recently provided by the HSE indicates that 347 appointments (237 permanent and 110 temporary) have been filled from the panel.  The panel is still live and the HSE keep its operation under review and base decisions on further recruitment campaigns on a number of factors including potential vacancies and whether the current panel can satisfy current recruitment requirements.  Notwithstanding the above discussions are underway to create internship posts to allow qualified physiotherapists continue their professional development and thus take up posts in the community where there is considerable demand.

The focus was on maintaining activity at current levels, and on ensuring no breaches of waiting time targets for hip and knee replacements.  The efficiency measures were agreed with the Clinicians at the hospital.  The HSE is now monitoring the position very closely to ensure that the financial savings and other targets that have been set will be achieved.

This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister for Health, because am determined to tackle the delays in access to hospital services, whether for emergency or elective care. The SDU is also a critical building block in the Government's plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of introducing a system of hospital trusts and access to services based on Universal Health Insurance (UHI).I have appointed Dr Martin Connor as Special Advisor to the SDU and to the Board of the HSE. Dr Connor is an international expert, with a proven track record in health service transformation. He has extensive experience in the NHS and led a similar initiative in Northern Ireland with considerable success.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing.  Dr Connor has already begun to work with the hospital system, to put in place new arrangements to reduce waiting times in emergency departments and to improve access to elective inpatient and day case services. This includes a detailed analysis of the emergency and elective access system.Part of the SDU's task will be to help speed up access to diagnostic tests, including MRIs.  The SDU is, of course, at an early stage of its work as yet, but am determined that it will deal with the unacceptable waiting time across a range of areas, including access to MRIs.

The information given to parents is reviewed and updated regularly.  HPV information campaigns in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and EU Member states were reviewed which clearly demonstrated that uptake was highest in countries that provided clear, effective and accessible public information to parents.  Content for all the information materials was developed following best practice on informed consent and literacy standards, and using feedback from parents in the target group (1600 girls in 21 schools received their first dose of vaccine in May 2010).  The information booklet for parents also addresses key questions about HPV, cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine.  The website (www.hpv.ie) contains more detailed information including the patient information leaflet for the product used and links to other relevant national and international websites. 
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	884	There are over 100 types of Human Papillomaviruses (HPV).  Around 40 HPV types can infect the genital tract.  Some of these are low-risk types (e.g. HPV 6 and 11) which cause genital warts, while others are high-risk types (e.g. HPV 16, 18, etc.) and are associated with various cancers such as cancer of the cervix.Gardasil which is the HPV vaccine used in the HSE's vaccination programme protects against HPV types 6,11, 16 and 18.  Types 16 and 18 are responsible for 7 out of 10 cervical cancers and Types 6 and 11 are responsible for more than 90% of genital warts.  The vaccination programme will, therefore, protect girls from developing 7 out of 10 cervical cancers.  The vaccines are not effective in women already infected with those specific types of HPV.  All women, including those vaccinated against HPV will still need to be screened under the National Cervical Screening Programme as the vaccine doesn't protect against all forms of HPV.Data from the continuing long term follow-up of women (16 — 45 years) vaccinated with three doses of Gardasil indicates that immunity (protection against clinical disease) to the HPV subtypes present in the Gardasil vaccine is maintained for at least for five years.  Studies monitoring the persistence of immunity over the longer term are ongoing.  The results of these will indicate if a booster dose is necessary and if a booster dose is required the secondary school girls currently being vaccinated will be informed.

Nurse on Call were awarded the contract for the provision of agency nurses on foot of a competitive tendering process.  Since 13 March 2011, Nurse on Call is the contracted agency for the provision of Agency Nurses to HSE Dublin, HSE Mid-Leinster, HSE South and HSE Dublin — North East.Nurse on Call, prior to being awarded the large HSE contract, used to run a daily payroll which effectively meant that nurses could be paid whenever they wanted.  However, due to the increase in volume, it was necessary for Nurse on Call to switch to a weekly payroll in line with industry standard.  This has caused some problems as now all staff must adhere to a strict deadline of Tuesday at noon for submission of timesheets.  I understand this to be the root cause of the issues that have arisen.

The Executive has stated that there is no backlog of work in the central office and all complete medical card applications and reviews are being processed within 15 working days or less.At the moment, PCRS has 245 whole time equivalent staff. About 90 staff have moved to the PCRS to implement the final phase of centralisation and the HSE is seeking redeployment, under the terms of the Public Service Agreement, to increase this number to 150.  I have raised this issue directly with the PCRS and I expressed my dissatisfaction that the full complement of HSE staff was not in place on 1st July.  I am advised that they hope to have the full complement of staff in place within the next 6-8 weeks.The PCRS central office has a contract with Matrix Resources, Sandyford, Dublin 18, to provide resource assistance in response to seasonal increases in demand for PCRS services.  The contract commenced in 2005 and, in each of the years 2008 to 2011, Matrix has provided up to 20 staff to PCRS. The HSE has confirmed that, in order to ensure that services are not adversely affected during the current transition, contingency arrangements will be in place for a  total of 12 weeks, until the complement of 150 whole time equivalent posts are filled in PCRS.  For this contingency period, Matrix Resources has provided an additional 40 whole time equivalent staff resources to ensure the continued delivery of service to the public.Separate to the 12-week contingency arrangements for the centralisation process, another company, Rigney Dolphin, has provided telephone support triage services to PCRS since mid-2010, including medical card customer queries support, and continues to do so.

These include the following:The product must be a medicinal product authorised by the Irish Medicines Board or the European Commission.The product must be such that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription.The product should not be advertised or promoted to the public.The medicine mentioned by the Deputy is not a licensed product and therefore is not eligible to be added to the List of Reimbursable Items.  However, the HSE operates a protocol under which unlicensed medicines, which satisfy specific criteria, are made available to patients.  I understand that the product in question has been made available for the patient referred to by the Deputy.

The contract between the HSE and GPs under the GMS Scheme stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients and to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  I should add that General Practitioners who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Prelude	917	I propose to take Questions Nos. 457 to 461, inclusive, together.The HSE National Service Plan 2011 which was approved in December 2010 requires the HSE to operate within the limits of its voted allocation of €13.456 billion.  This represents a net reduction of €683m on the 2010 provision.  The HSE National Service Plan also commits the HSE to delivering service levels for 2011 which are broadly in line with 2010 levels.  Letterkenny General Hospital like all other hospitals is required to operate within its budget of almost €95 million for 2011 and to meet the service level activity targets that the hospital has agreed for 2011.The admission of patients presenting as emergencies through the A&E Department at Letterkenny is undertaken as promptly as possible and any delays in the emergency department for admission to a bed minimised.  This focus on managing the emergency workload is reflected in the excellent rating on Healthstat that Letterkenny General Hospital continues to receive when compared with other peer hospitals.  Every effort is made by the Hospital to avoid the cancellation of out patients clinics and the deferral of elective surgery.  However on occasion this may be unavoidable.  In the first six months of 2011 only one out patient clinic a month on average was affected.I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.In relation to issues around the recruitment of NCHDs, I have been informed by the HSE that arrangements are in place to ensure that services are maintained.  While it is not expecting any service  curtailment, it will continue to monitor the position closely in hospitals where there have been difficulties in filling posts.  Externally recruited doctors will be placed to support continuing service provision.

I will arrange to forward the Deputies' questions to my colleague, the Minister for Health for direct response in this regard.  Concerning the taxi rank infrastructure in the cities referred to, decisions concerning the location and operation of taxi ranks on public roads, as well as funding for the provision of taxi ranks, are primarily matters for the relevant local authority, as provided for under Section 84 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the taxi sector under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  With regard to taxi ranks the NTA's role relates to the issue of guidance on the planning, design and provision of ranks aimed at improving taxi services to the public, better designed pick-up locations for taxi operators and greater integration of taxi services with the wider public transport system. Last month I announced a Taxi Regulation Review in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. The terms of reference of the review are wide-ranging including the current regulatory policy and practices, licensing systems, enforcement and future dialogue with the taxi sector. The consultation for the review extends to all interested parties and stakeholders through an invitation for written submissions to be made before the end of July.

My Department is currently exploring efficiencies that can be made by bringing together aspects of the HSE transport arrangements, schools transport, the Rural Transport Programme and other transport services.  A pilot scheme study has been carried out, which I will publish shortly.     A Value for Money and Policy Review of the Rural Transport Programme has now been completed.  I have received a copy of this report, which I also intend to publish later this year, following consideration by Government. I will be incorporating the findings of both the Value for Money review and of the pilot scheme into the plans for the future of the rural transport programme.

The review will enable the necessary further reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.  It  will address a wide range of issues relating to the taxi sector including the current regulatory policy and practices, licensing systems, enforcement and future dialogue with the taxi sector.In my view the wide ranging membership of the Review Steering Group allows an appropriate contribution from stakeholders, and individuals who represent the interests of the taxi sector, including dispatch operators and drivers, and the interests of consumers, as well as, including the regulatory and enforcement agencies.  I should add that the consultation on the review extends to all interested parties and stakeholders through an invitation for written submissions to be made before the end of July.

The carrying out of works on these roads and bridges is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the council.A total of €439,676,000 is being provided to local authorities for regional and local roads in 2011.  This includes the additional €60 million provided by the government in May this year under the jobs initiative.  From this allocation, Kerry County Council is being provided with a total of €19,071,422.In July last year, local authorities were invited to submit proposals for funding in 2011 under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme.  Kerry County Council submitted 10 applications for funding in 2011.  However, Valentia Bridge was not among the Council's proposals.  It is open to Kerry County Council to prioritise the Valentia Bridge scheme for funding and to submit this project for funding under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme in 2012 when applications are sought in due course.  Alternatively, the local authority may fund this project through its own resources.

Regional and local road (RLR) grants are often announced in January but in any event are normally advised to local authorities no later than mid-February.  The latter timeline applied in 2010 when some extra time was needed to determine how best to structure the grants in response to the severe winter weather.  Notwithstanding a further severe winter in 2011 the RLR grants for that year were announced on 1 February.    In order to enable local authorities to commence work on their road programmes as soon as possible, they may incur expenditure of up to 10% of the previous year's allocation in respect of the Discretionary, Block and Restoration Improvement Grant categories, pending the allocation of the current year's grants.  In special circumstances, flexibility may also be provided to local authorities in relation to spending of a higher percentage of monies in advance of grant allocations.

Will the Deputy please advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within 10 working days.However, in the context of the current Capital Spending Review, it is clear that there will be little scope to advance in the short to medium term many of the infrastructural projects currently in planning.  Many of these projects have reached route selection phase.  I am aware that this creates difficulty for many landowners along selected routes due to so-called ‘planning blight'.  However, I am reluctant to cancel such projects given that there are projects designed for their long-term benefit to the state, and it will be important to be able to proceed with them rapidly when the State's finances return to equilibrium.I am currently considering what remedies may be possible in order to ensure that land-owners whose property is along a selected route, but where that project is unlikely to proceed during the course of the next National Development Plan, are not unduly impacted by planning restrictions.  I would welcome the views of the Deputy and any stakeholders on this subject.

Under the scheme, grants are provided to county councils for the construction and improvement of non-public roads which provide access to parcels of land of which at least two are owned or occupied by different persons engaged in separate agricultural activities, or provide access for harvesting purposes for two or more persons, or which will in the opinion of the county council be used by the public. Provision of assistance for non public roads has to take account of current serious financial constraints.  There are no proposals at present to amend the scheme in the manner suggested by the Deputy.
