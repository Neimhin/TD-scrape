#RobbieGallagher	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-party	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-dob	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	1	I dtús, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. I welcome the Minister and thank her for her attendance. I would like to highlight the issue of the Bose factory in Carrickmacross, which closed in May 2015 with the loss of over 150 jobs to the town of Carrickmacross. Bose had been in Carrickmacross since 1978 and was very successful there but unfortunately it has now transferred its operations to Malaysia and Mexico. Despite attempts by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to find a replacement, no new investor has been found to date. The building is now an empty shell. It is a fine facility which extends to 8,000 sq. ft. of accommodation of both office and production facilities. It has over 200 car parking spaces and it sits on a site area of approximately 7.2 acres. Indigenous jobs have been the backbone of County Monaghan to date. That has been the history. A few companies have worldwide recognition, namely, Monaghan Mushrooms, a leading light in the production of mushrooms, and Combilift, another name that is recognised worldwide. Unfortunately, all of these companies are under severe threat aas a result of Brexit and the constant and current decline in the value of sterling. There is now extreme pressure on the local economy and local business as a result of this. If ever there was a time in Monaghan for a need to diversify employment, it is now. We are at a critical junction in our history. An interesting statistic is that in 2014, 85% of leaving certificate students progressed to further education. That is very welcome. Unfortunately, only 24% of those graduates end up getting employment in County Monaghan. That is quite a worrying statistic. Our young people are being educated and moving on and not returning back home again. This statistic is very low by national standards. I get no pleasure in saying the record of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in attracting business to the county in general has been very poor. An example of this is that from 2009 to the first quarter of 2016, which is a seven-year period, only four visits have occurred. Four visits in seven years is a sad indictment which is even more emphasised when one considers the location of Carrickmacross. It is less than 45 minutes from Dublin Airport and there is a motorway almost the whole way to Dublin city. It also has good transport links to Belfast. It is a great place to live and housing is very affordable. It has a lot going for it. I plead with the Minister to redouble her efforts to encourage IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to look at County Monaghan as a viable location for any industry because we are hurting. The facility has being lying idle for over a year and a half now. We are under increased pressure owing to Brexit and the pressures of the declining value of sterling. We are at a crossroads. It is critical that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland refocus their efforts on trying to get replacement industry into County Monaghan in order that we can counteract the losses we have incurred and the hurt we are going through. I again thank the Minister for her time and attention. The members of Carrickmacross-Castleblayney municipal district would be delighted to have a meeting with at her earliest convenience to try to progress this issue.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I thank the Senator for raising this Commencement matter. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and Senator James Reilly have also raised the issue with me. I was very disappointed when Bose made the decision to leave Carrickmacross after spending over 37 years in County Monaghan. The impact of this closure was very difficult not only for the 140 full-time employees and their families but also for those who work seasonally at the plant and the wider community.Following the announcement of this closure, an inter-agency co-ordination group chaired by Enterprise Ireland was established to address the needs of the affected staff. IDA Ireland was a member of this group with Monaghan County Council, the local enterprise office, the Department of Social Protection and the education and training boards of Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath. The group helped to develop a demographic and skills profile of former staff at the BOSE facility. This was completed by IDA Ireland in partnership with BOSE human resources, HR, locally. This profile is central to IDA Ireland's marketing of the location to clients whose requirements it may match. Enterprise Ireland also actively markets the facility to its client base. As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am committed to finding a new investor for the site and to bringing new employment opportunities to Carrickmacross. IDA Ireland obviously has an important role to play and know that the agency is committed to attracting new investment to the north-east region. I am in regular contact with the agency and I have directed it to ensure every effort is made to market the facility and the town to potential investors. It remains the case, however, that the ultimate decision by companies as to where to locate in Ireland is always taken by their management. I emphasise that supporting regional job creation has been a priority of mine since my first day in office. I want to ensure regional Ireland benefits from our hard-won economic growth and that the jobs recovery is felt in every single county. As announced yesterday as part of the budget, my Department has secured funding for a number of measures that will improve regional competitiveness and help Border counties in particular to cope with the impact of Brexit. There are other policy tools at our disposal to help regional development. For example, the north east-north west action plan for jobs launched in November last year aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the north east. I have met this group. All regional action plans will also be supported by investment of up to €250 million in the next five years, including €150 million for IDA Ireland's regional property programme. In addition, IDA Ireland has committed to increasing investment by 30% to 40% in each region by 2019 as part of its strategy Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019. The north east has many strengths, including a talented workforce, its existing cluster of companies in international business services and engineering and its proximity to Dublin Airport. I am confident, therefore, that Carrickmacross, together with the wider region, will experience increased employment and investment in the time ahead. I would be very glad to meet the Monaghan group the Senator would like me to meet.

I welcome the contents of her statement. The old adage that "the proof of the pudding is in the eating" springs to mind. When we turn on the radio every morning and hear about job announcements, they are normally in Cork, Dublin or Galway. Good luck to those three locations, I do not have any issues with them. However, I would love to turn on my radio some morning and hear about a jobs announcement in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal or elsewhere. Until Government policy is very much pointed in that direction, I am afraid it could be some time before we hear those announcements on our radio stations. I will give those involved the benefit of the doubt. I look forward to IDA Ireland's commitment to increase investment in the regions by 30% to 40%. When one considers the statistics I provided this morning - the fact that there have been four visits in seven years - most people would admit that one would not get too excited about a 30% or 40% increase on that figure. We live in hope. I look forward to the Government keeping a special eye on regions such as counties Monaghan and Cavan and all of the Border areas that are suffering and that will continue to suffer hardship until Brexit washes itself through. I also look forward to the Government trying to encourage IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to, in turn, encourage investors to come to those locations.

I want to make it very clear that Government policy is to ensure there is regional development across the country. There is a strategic group in County Monaghan working to ensure that jobs are brought to the county and the Border area. I have met that implementation group. There are regional plans. Perhaps it would be a good idea for the Senator to get the regional plan for the area in order to ensure he knows what are the exact targets. I would be delighted to meet the group the Senator asked me to meet. I have met the county manager, the different educational people, the local enterprise offices, IDA Ireland and Enterprise representatives there. I will meet the group mentioned by the Senator. It is a targeted area and we will do everything we can to make sure that jobs come to County Monaghan.
#ColetteKelleher	unknown-#ColetteKelleher-party	unknown-#ColetteKelleher-dob	unknown-#ColetteKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath. I also welcome the increased health spending announced in yesterday's budget, particularly provisions for home-care services and people with disabilities. With more money, the major challenge now is to ensure the announcement translates into the much-needed services and supports for people who need them. This matter relates to the 25,000 people in Ireland who are living with neurological conditions and need rehabilitation every year and their carers. Despite spending more money than ever before on health care, there are still dire shortages in some services. I draw the Minister of State's attention to the lack of core services for people living with conditions such as stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Every year, over 25,000 people need rehabilitation and most of them struggle to get the services they require. Many need specialist services with skilled multidisciplinary teams to support them on their rehabilitation pathway. Without access to core rehabilitation services, people are left with preventable disabilities, cannot return to work and are accommodated in nursing homes which can often be completely unsuitable for their needs. This problem is at crisis level because services are under-developed and under-resourced. People with neurological conditions report the following problems with neuro-rehabilitation services. They include problems with availability and waiting lists, inequities in access, lack of clear pathways, lack of co-ordination and significant problems in navigating the system. It is bad enough to have been diagnosed with a stroke but the person must then try to find his or her way through a system in circumstances where he or she needs help. Other problems include lack of support and training for family members, lack of skilled neuro-rehabilitation health care professionals and failures in the Department of Health and the HSE to drive the necessary change relating to the growth and development of neuro-rehabilitation services. Recent media coverage has highlighted these issues and how people are suffering as a result. We have heard from people waiting over two years for a place in the National Rehabilitation Hospital as well as people travelling abroad for rehabilitation and, what is worse, losing any gains when they return due to a lack of appropriate neuro-rehabilitation services in the community. Many more never got the opportunity to get the rehabilitation they needed and lost a vital window of recovery that will impact them for the rest of their lives. The case I am about to outline is just one example.Mr. Colm Griffin was 36 years old, healthy and fit, and a qualified engineer. As a result of corrective surgery on an aneurysm in 2015, he had a stroke. The left side of his body was affected and he could no longer walk, use his left arm or dress himself. He was unable to drive or go to work. In Cork University Hospital, he got access to physiotherapy and hydrotherapy but otherwise the facilities were very limited. In February 2016, he got a bed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and completed 12 weeks of therapy. Although the individual therapists did their very best, his experience was one of deep frustration as there are huge limitations on the number of therapy hours there. He kept a timetable from that time and recorded an average of three hours physiotherapy over five days and just one hour of hydrotherapy. In addition, there was no access to the facilities after hours or at the weekend. Since he returned home, friends and family had to fund-raise to pay for private physiotherapy. Ireland should have 270 inpatient beds for our population but we have less than half of that number and none outside Dublin. We should have four regional inpatient specialist rehabilitation services nationwide but we have none. There should be at a minimum nine community neuro-rehabilitation teams nationwide, one in each community health organisation as a starting point, but there are only three, and these are only partially staffed. We have the lowest number of consultants in rehabilitation medicine anywhere in Europe. The lack of specialist and community rehabilitation services is impacting significantly on other areas of the health system, as the Minister of State knows, exacerbating the problem of delayed discharges from acute hospitals. The national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland was published in 2011 and it is unacceptable that there has been little progress in the development of new services since its publication. A long overdue draft implementation framework for the strategy was finally released, five years later, in February 2016. The Neurological Alliance of Ireland and others have serious concerns with the draft framework which lacks dedicated funding and any timelines. It also lacks accountability and the scope required to deliver real improvements that people need. It is essential that a revised plan is put in place. I wrote to the HSE which has stated it has long appreciated the need to review the issue. That is hardly good enough after five years. I would like specifics on what plans the Minister has in place to secure the 270 inpatient beds. When will these beds be in place? When will we have beds outside Dublin in places such as Cork? What about the four regional inpatient specialist services and when will the Minister put in place fully the nine community neuro-rehabilitation teams? We have waited a very long time and the people with the conditions are really in need and at risk. I would like some specifics and clear timetable.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue. As it is my first time debating with her, I welcome her to the Seanad and congratulate her on being nominated. We need voices like hers in the Seanad, particularly with respect to this morning's subject. I will respond here, but I will speak to her later about issues relating to her question. I thank the Senator for raising the matter of inpatient and community neuro-rehabilitation services and improving the patient pathway from hospital to home. I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position in that regard. A Programme for a Partnership Government places a particular focus on a number of key programmes and strategies, including publishing a plan for advancing neuro-rehabilitation services in the community. As part of a review of how specialist rehabilitation services are accessed and provided, the HSE and the Department of Health jointly published the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland 2011 to 2015. In addition, the rehabilitation medicine programme was established within the clinical strategy and programmes directorate of the Health Service Executive. With regard to the update, a steering group, led by the HSE social care division, has circulated a draft implementation framework for the national policy and strategy for neuro-rehabilitation services for consultation to members of the steering group and stakeholder agencies. This implementation framework will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level. The framework outlines key issues, themes and considerations. It makes particular reference to the need to reconfigure and develop community services within the HSE's community health care organisations and inpatient specialist rehabilitation services. It is planned that implementation of the neuro-rehabilitation policy and strategy will involve reconfiguration and development of resources with the community health care organisations to establish specialist neuro-rehabilitation teams within each area. Second, it will involve reconfiguration and development of specialist inpatient rehabilitation services in line with the rehabilitation medicine programme model of care and national trauma policy and integration of all specialist rehabilitation services within what is envisaged to be managed clinical networks. Moreover, each of the nine community health care organisations will establish local implementation teams; a neuro-rehabilitation network, based on a hub and spoke model, will serve population-based areas of the country; and managed networks will link closely with the National Rehabilitation Hospital, community rehabilitation teams, primary care and acute hospitals in their areas. Specialist inpatient services are concentrated at a national level in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The hospital provides a comprehensive range of specialist rehabilitation services for adult and paediatric patients. These are patients who, as a result of accident or injury have acquired physical or cognitive disability and require specialist medical rehabilitation. Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of disciplines to meet the particular needs of individuals. The objective is to assist with returning to life in the community with confidence. Approximately 1,000 people are treated on an inpatient basis at the hospital each year and approximately 5,000 people are treated on an outpatient basis. Many patients have a lifelong association with the hospital. The Government has also announced a major capital development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The project will deliver a 120 replacement bed ward block. It will include support therapies to paediatrics and acquired brain injury patients, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall. Its completion is the priority project in rehabilitation medicine. It is envisaged that the implementation of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services, along with the investment in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, will greatly contribute to improved care pathways for patients from home to hospital. This is a priority service issue, on which I am working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris. There has been talking about this for too long. We want to push on the agenda. I will respond to further questions. The Minister and I feel very strongly that we must invest in this service and do the job.

It is a great policy but it was meant to run to 2015 and we are now in 2016. There is an implementation plan, a framework, a steering group and reconfiguration. When will all these translate into inpatient beds and community teams, and when will the developments in the hospital be completed? Is there enough in the budget this year to do all of this? Should we see it fully implemented by the end of 2017?

Our problem will be the competing elements within the budget. The Senator can take it from me that this is a priority issue. I agree with her that this must translate into action in delivering the services. We have the plans and focus; therefore, it is up to us who are in a position to push it along. I accept that services are underdeveloped and hanging around for another two years would not be acceptable. I give that commitment, but I will go back to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris. Both of us will work on the issue. I hope to see some serious movement before Christmas. There is extra funding available.We are all, including me, competing for different slices of the pot for disabilities. This is within that sector. I will do my best and give a commitment today, given that we need to have these services developed. These are people with major issues in their lives and we must do something about it.

This matter relates to a patient who has been in St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, since January 2016. The advice from the medical people in May 2016 was that the appropriate facility would be Bloomfield Hospital. Bloomfield Hospital carried out an assessment and found he was a suitable patient. No decision has been taken since on the transfer. When I communicated with the HSE, its attitude was the matter was not under its jurisdiction. I contacted St. Vincent's University Hospital by telephone and correspondence and failed to receive a definitive answer as to how the issue would be resolved. The family is extremely concerned given they have been left with nothing in writing setting out exactly what will happen. This is the first time in six years that I have had to put such a matter to the Minister by way of a Commencement matter. I hope it is my last time. No family should be left waiting in this manner. That is why I am seeking the clarification.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	14	I thank the Senator for raising the issue. He is referring to an individual who is an inpatient at St. Vincent’s University Hospital. The patient has finished his acute phase of treatment and is on the hospital’s delayed discharge list as requiring long-term residential care. Government policy is to support older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. There will, however, always be a cohort of older people who require a long-term residential care option. The nursing homes support scheme is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care. Anyone who is assessed as needing long-term nursing home care can avail of the scheme regardless of their age. The scheme provides financial support towards the cost of the standard components of nursing home care. Patients contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The scheme aims to ensure long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The scheme has a net budget in 2016 of €940 million. This represents an increase of €43.1 million on the 2015 outturn. It is expected that the scheme will provide financial support to 22,989 clients on average per week in 2016. The purpose of the nursing homes support scheme is to provide a sustainable system of financial support for people in need of long-term nursing home care, which ensures such care is affordable for all who need it. Applicants are free to choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home in the State. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs. On the Senator's specific query, Bloomfield Hospital is a 114-bed mental health hospital registered as an approved centre with the Mental Health Commission. The nursing homes support scheme, however, does not extend to either the disability or mental health sectors and it would contravene the statute underpinning the scheme to support a patient in this facility. The HSE is endeavouring to support the discharge of patients who have been deemed medically fit for discharge and require alternative supports, be it long-term care, home care or transitional care. The HSE has provided a list of alternative facilities that accept national nursing home scheme funding. The man was offered a place in Rathdrum public unit but it is understood this offer was not accepted. The HSE is working with the hospital social work team to find a suitable placement and the Clonskeagh community nursing unit is being considered as it has appropriate single-room accommodation and would be more accessible for the family. I hope that is the answer the Senator seeks.

The information she gave in the last part of her answer is new to me and the family. In May, the medical team in St. Vincent's University Hospital identified that Bloomfield Hospital was the appropriate place. Nothing has been given in writing since, although the family has written to the CEO of St. Vincent's University Hospital. I have written to the CEO of St. Vincent's University Hospital and have spoken to Mary McGrath, the person who deals with patient complaints. We have received nothing in writing from anybody. The answer is not adequate and I need something in writing. The person was deemed unsuitable for a nursing home facility. This was the advice the family received in May 2016 and nothing further has been given to them in writing since then. The family has been left in mid-air on the matter for the past four to five months and nobody is putting anything in writing. This is the first we have seen of this position being offered and the first time the Clonskeagh facility has been mentioned. I do not understand why something cannot be set down in writing on what is the appropriate way to deal with the matter. While the family is supportive of St. Vincent's University Hospital and whatever decision is made, nothing has been put in writing as regards best management. That is why we are concerned.

I am returning to an issue I raised previously with the Minister's predecessor regarding the social welfare offices that were closed in rural areas and in the Connemara area in particular. As the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar is aware, when Deputy Joan Burton was Minister, there was a movement of community welfare officers, CWOs, from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection in 2011 and 2012, with the Department taking over more than 900 clinics that the CWOs previously undertook. The Minister at the time maintained that the service had been enhanced, with phone lines being preferable to clinics and CWOs visiting people's homes to meet them where needed. It was said that the restructuring of the services was to be done in a way that would not compromise the accessibility of the CWO and the person who succeeded them, as the job specification and the name have changed. We had a particular concern in Connemara with the closure of the service in Carraroe and the services in Oughterard and Spiddal being rationalised and moved to Galway city. The Minister at the time told us it was to provide for a streamlined and consistent service to the customer. The language used was interesting in that it proposed a "customer" rather than a client, and that anybody using the services of a CWO or social welfare office is regarded as a customer as opposed to a client.We were informed that where community welfare services had been restructured, alternative arrangements had been put in place to ensure "customers" - that word again - would be provided with ongoing access to the supports provided by the service and that, in general, this would mean that the frequency of available public clinics would be increased. At the time, with others, I raised issues about this because in rural areas where a service was being removed or moved to an urban centre, transport connections such as bus services were not available. The latter remains the case. For example, there is no bus service to Clifden, the nearest centre for people living in Carna, County Galway. Anyone wishing to go to the city would have to get a bus first thing in the morning, stay in the city all day and return at night. This is still the case. From places such as Carna, the bus service runs only a couple of days a week. People have told me they have been asked to attend at the centre in Galway on several occasions for three and four days in the same week in some cases in order to finalise their claims for supports from the Department of Social Protection. It has been said that in instances where people are not in a position to travel due to a lack of resources or transport, officials from the Department would call out to them to ensure that they were provided with a service. Somebody at a briefing on the family resource centres in the audio-visual room of these Houses last week said this does not happen when a request is made. My question relates to the closure of these offices, particularly in the context of exceptional needs payments that would have been paid over the three previous years. How much of a saving has the regional office made in exceptional needs payments to the people of Connemara since those offices were shut down? What is the level of overall savings made by the Department through the closure of those offices? Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Aire faoi theacht isteach agus tá mé ag súil go mór leis an bhfreagra a bheidh aige dom.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	23	I thank the Senator for raising this issue of the community welfare service, CWS, in Connemara and, in particular, the closure, in September 2013, of offices in An Spidéal, An Cheathrú Rua agus Cill Chiaráin. The Government has provided €30.3 million for the exceptional needs and urgent needs payment schemes in 2016. In line with all supplementary allowance schemes, the overall reduction in the live register and general improvement in the economy has reduced recourse to exceptional needs payments, ENPs. In 2012, 459 ENPs totalling €149,000 were paid in the three offices and 177 payments totalling €73,000 were paid up to the end of September in 2013. Corresponding details on payments since September 2013 are not available as all such payments are now included in the figures for Galway city and Clifden and are not separately identified. In 2012 a working group made up of staff from the CWS reviewed the ENP guidelines with a view to achieving standardisation and consistency in the treatment of applications across the country. This review was used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013. These guidelines provide maximum recommended amounts for specific items such as white goods, furniture and prams. The Department reviewed these guidelines in 2015 and no changes were provided to the recommended amounts. The guidelines assist Department staff administering the scheme and do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing a payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. The ENP scheme is demand led and continues to provide assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. Following the transfer of the service from the Health Service Executive, HSE, to the Department in 2011, the Department has re-engineered its business model to support the provision of integrated services across all business streams involved in the delivery of localised services. As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location. The change is a move away from the traditional model of one CWS officer serving an individual location and delivering the full range of services towards a sustainable team-based approach. Where the service has been restructured, including in the Connemara area, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with ongoing access to the supports provided by the service. In the Galway area, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone service and dedicated e-mail address are available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel - for example, due to illness - including arranging a visit to the client’s home as necessary. In addition, an appointments service is now in operation which is proving very successful in terms of efficient service delivery. The community welfare clinics in An Spidéal, An Cheathrú Rua agus Cil Chiaráin all operated from premises under the remit of the HSE. The amount of money paid to the HSE for the use of their premises is included in the overall memorandum of understanding between the Department and the HSE which covers the whole country. Savings from the closure of particular clinics have not been calculated and could only be estimated on an apportionment basis. Staff who were working in these locations at the time of their closure were transferred to Galway, two remaining in the CWS and the third transferring to employment services as a case officer in the integrated Intreo service. As a result, there were no staff-cost savings. I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer-facing services at a local level for all customers of the Department and would like to reassure the Senator that the changes to the services in Connemara were not undertaken as a cost-saving measure but instead were intended to enhance the integration of all of the Department’s localised services in County Galway. I am not entirely sure what the Senator meant by making a distinction between customers and clients, but I would be interested to understand it.

I suppose using the frame of a business model in respect of people engaged in employment services indicates the language that a client of a State agency now becomes a customer of the State agency. My concern is the use of that language. I am unhappy with the cutbacks that have happened in the ENP because even with the figures available from 2012 to 2013 it is quite clear they were cut back to a third of what they had been the previous year. I would guess that if the figures were available, we would see an even bigger cutback. One of the issues was the closure of the offices in rural areas. People looking for an ENP cannot afford to go to an office in the city. They feel compelled to travel into the city to go to the Intreo offices and in many cases feel intimidated in there. I know the Minister is a great proponent of the Irish language but many of these feel that the service is not being made available through Irish, for which they have to make a special effort to ask. It is very unfortunate that, according to the figures available, there has been such a huge reduction in the number of ENPs paid. Now that we are told the economy is improving, would the Minister reconsider reopening an office in the Connemara area to make it easier for those clients to access the Department's services for ENPs and other matters?

To me, a customer is somebody who goes into a business and probably pays money whereas this situation is the reverse. Health care always disliked the move away from the term "patient" to those of "client" or "customer". It is the term the Department uses and it is not trying to disparage those who rely on our services but to ingrain the idea of a business model in the operations of the Department. Perhaps it is not the right language. I visited the Intreo centre in Galway city a couple of weeks ago. It is a very impressive building and a very modern centre. I met some of the community welfare officers, including the lady who goes out to the clinic in Kilronan on Inis Mór, on the Aran Islands, and chatted with them about this issue. They are very much of the view that they can provide the service in Galway city over the telephone or by making house calls if needs be. For that reason, there are no proposals to open new offices anywhere in the country. The overall cost of ENPs has gone down across the country for two reasons: first, fewer people have recourse to these payments because fewer are unemployed and incomes are rising again; and, second, payments were standardised across the country. On the latter point, in the past, because these payments came from the old health board system, people in different parts of the country were receiving different amounts in respect of the same fridges, microwaves or whatever they needed. There were significant savings when ENPs were standardised.

It will not improve the quality of education being provided for young people. The numbers attending primary and secondary education next year will grow by up to 12,000, and the extra 2,400 teachers will not impact the pupil-teacher ratio but will rather just meet the demand of those 12,000 extra pupils. Irish classes are the most overcrowded in the European Union with a ratio, on average, of 25:1 in a class on a good day. Last week I raised in the Seanad the issue of a DEIS school in my area which has a pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1. I ask the Minister to re-examine the way the criteria for DEIS schools are implemented. That was not raised in the budget yesterday and it is an issue we need to tackle, especially in the light of the commitment to provide extra gardaí and the extra expenditure on education. Unless the educational needs of people living in disadvantaged areas are addressed, we will not see any improvement in terms of giving children every opportunity. It is incumbent on us to make that investment in children's education and not do nothing. The announcement in the budget yesterday only just meets the demand in terms of the 12,000 additional pupils. We need to go over and above that to ensure we give children the best education possible to allow them take up foreign direct investment jobs in the future. We want to give them the best in life. People cannot get their teeth cleaned if they have a medical card. This is Mental Health Week and getting one's teeth cleaned not only goes some way towards ensuring mouth cancer and other diseases are identified at an early stage but also to improving one's self-esteem. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to look into that issue. Up until 2008, one could get one's teeth cleaned twice a year. There is not much incentive to go to the dentist for a regular check-up. However, it might be an incentive for people to go to have their teeth cleaned, which would ensure their oral health was maintained. It would save the Exchequer in the long term because mouth cancer and other diseases can be identified at an early stage.

I will leave it at that. The budget failed to demonstrate a real and tangible commitment to decades of neglect in rural Ireland. If this is the best the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil combo has to offer on the centenary of 1916, it is surely time for an alternative. The 2017 budget patched together by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Independents clearly demonstrates a lack of urgency in addressing the real issues facing rural families and communities. Do they not understand that if we continue to do the same thing we have always done, we will get the same results? I refer to high emigration, unemployment, the working poor, struggling families, issues with schools, and post office closures. At a time when we need vision and bold ideas to rejuvenate rural Ireland and address regional imbalance, we get promises of another action plan and crumbs from the table of the Government. While it is welcome that some of the measures proposed in the Sinn Féin alternative budget have been taken on board, such as the improvements to farm assist and the 500 additional places on the rural social scheme, the failure to address the cost of living will leave families struggling. The famous five increases for pensioners and some social welfare recipients will not remain in their pockets for long when they pay their property tax, prescription charges, telephone and energy bills. More than the 85,000 people over the age of 65 years will continue living in deprivation under the Government. The Government was more about the two parties keeping each other on board rather than addressing the serious problems of rural Ireland. Young people on social welfare continue to be discriminated against. These are the same young people who are expected to clothe, feed and house themselves while looking for work and paying extortionate car insurance, all on €100 per week. They are not magicians. Sinn Féin is the only alternative that will genuinely reduce the cost of living and invest in public services and the only alternative that will build an all-Ireland economy while investing in long-term growth. We can only achieve that by building a tax system that is fair and equitable. Promises to close the door after the horse has bolted to address tax avoidance measures will ring hollow for those who have suffered most because the wealthiest in this country and beyond have been facilitated to make obscene profits without having to pay tax. The litmus test of the budget will be whether it provides beds for the sick and elderly lying on trolleys, whether it tackles the 530,000 people on waiting lists for appointments, whether it provides meaningful treatment and supports for children with special needs and adults with disabilities and whether it gives a break to carers or facilitates job creation that pays a decent wage.

There are good things in the budget and anybody with a fair mind would acknowledge that. However, I would like the Leader to address two issues which concern children. These are two issues in which we expected the advancements of the past few years would have been built on. One is the issue of class sizes and the second is the issue of free GP care for those under 12 years. When an improvement is made over a number of years, it is a reasonable expectation that this improvement would be continued.  In the past few years class sizes in primary schools have not been made worse. They have not been increased. In budget 2016 the pupil-teacher ratio was decreased at primary and secondary level. It was reduced by one point at primary level where the issue is acute. The expectation was that over a number of years, it would gradually be brought down. That did not happen in yesterday's budget. I am a little disturbed by that because surely when we now have resources to invest in areas that are clearly crying out for investment, class size is one of those issues that affects every school-going child in primary school and their parents. Many children in large classes will do fine because they can achieve in any circumstances but children with special educational needs or behavioural difficulties are the ones who will benefit from smaller class sizes. The vision of going from having the largest class sizes in Europe to progressively bringing down that pupil-teacher ratio is something I thought would continue from last year but it has not happened. I think we should have a discussion on that in this Chamber.  Again, we made a huge advance on the issue of free GP care for children under the age of six years. I felt at the time it was a major advance that also would be continued. Again, for some reason, free GP care for those under 12 years has slipped below the radar. The children of Ireland who had a reasonable expectation that their class sizes would have come down and that free GP care for those under 12 years would also have been introduced will be a bit surprised. Where is the Government's vision for those two areas?
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	41	I wish to speak about the insurance industry. Rises in motor insurance have been highlighted a lot in the past couple of weeks. I would like to talk about my personal experience two years ago when a protestor jumped on my car and falsely accused me of a hit and run and being drunk at the time. I reported it to the insurance company I was dealing with and lost my no-claims bonus for reporting it. When I rang other companies to get cheaper insurance, I was told that I could not go anywhere. I had to stay with the company and pay nearly three times the amount my premium should have been. It went on for 15 or 16 months. When my insurance came up for renewal, I rang the insurance company and was put through to the claims department. Thankfully, the person in question had made no claim because it was totally untrue and fabricated. It was in all the national newspapers. It was a terrible time for my family and me. What I found out by default from the claims department of this insurance company was that €21,000 was set aside for this lady if she did claim. She did not claim. This person could have claimed and I would have been told it had nothing to do with me anymore and the insurers would sort it out. If this is happening in the insurance industry, no wonder our insurance costs have gone up by 30% or 40%. It must be looked at and regulated. I have heard that this is happening in several insurance companies where they put this amount away once there is a claim or a reported claim. It is just not good enough. We need to debate the insurance industry, we need the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to come to the House and we need new legislation when it comes to the claims system.

As everyone knows, access to and quality of broadband are critical for business in rural Ireland. Never mind job creation, job retention is totally dependent on it. We have seen many dates come and go. We were told initially that 90% of houses and businesses would be connected by the end of 2015. The figure then changed to 85% by the end of 2019 and then to 100% by 2022. It now looks like it will be 2023 before quality broadband is rolled out. People and businesses need to know what the exact dates are for this because it is vitally important, particularly for rural Ireland. Perhaps the Leader might consider asking the Minister to come to the House to address us on this issue. In respect of the comments from my colleague from Sinn Féin, it is an awful pity Sinn Féin was not as enthusiastic about getting involved in the budget process during the formation of the Government. Perhaps if it had done so rather than sit on its hands, it might have less to complain about this morning.

The substantive point I want to raise today concerns the north west - Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. I am proud to say that in a number of weeks' time, a radiotherapy unit will open in Derry that will service 500,000 people in the region. It is an example of cross-Border co-operation endorsed by the entire community - Unionist and nationalist and is funded by the two Governments. It is an example of where we need to move forward. The problem is that this region of 500,000 people has no motorway, rail or air connection to the capital city. It is totally disconnected. If you get out the map of Ireland out, you will see motorways and rail and air links to Belfast, rightly so. You will also see such links to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. There is a complete blank spot. Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross? When we talk about Brexit and a strategy to deal with its implications, we need a commitment from the Government on co-funding the A5 project, which will come back on track in 2017, and in respect of the City of Derry Airport. The airport deals with 340,000 passengers every year, of whom 40% or roughly 150,000 are from Donegal, yet not one cent from the Government is going into that airport. We need the Minister, a former Member of this House, to come to the House and listen to the views of 500,000 Irish citizens in that region who are disconnected from their capital city and from equality in terms of the access that would be expected for citizens across this island.

He is right that the City of Derry Airport is used by a lot of people from Donegal, as is the A5. I think a lot more work could be done. I am a little concerned about the United Kingdom leaving the European Union and Brexit.It could have implications for funding for those vital cross-Border infrastructure projects. Sometimes we spend our time criticising the European Union and some of its ideas. However, I have discovered an idea which I think is absolutely wonderful. It is an interesting proposal. The proposal is to offer every 18 year old the opportunity to travel throughout Europe free of charge by train for four weeks. Up to 300,000 European 18-year-olds could avail of this popular inter-rail scheme for free. It could give many young people the opportunity to travel around Europe, to explore and to become European. I believe the House should support this initiative. It will cost up to €3 billion but it will get people out of their comfort zones to travel around Europe. I certainly agree with Manfred Weber, who said: "Europe is about emotions, to see other cultures, to see other languages." People all around Europe can get to know and learn to cherish each other. It is a wonderful idea. It is something I did 30 years ago and I enjoyed every minute of it. Perhaps if I had not travelled, I might have got a normal job and enjoyed myself. We should absolutely encourage this wonderful proposal. Well done to the European Union.

I had an experience once. I was stationary in a line of traffic on the East Link Bridge. The driver of an articulated lorry had not seen my car because it is low slung. The lorry came and crashed into the side of it. It is on video. The people in the box saw it. I reported it. The insurance company paid €1,100 for my car to be repaired. My insurance company never went after the person. Those responsible simply left it. They ignored it. It was desperate stuff. I was interested to hear Sinn Féin raising the question of the Bank of Ireland and the way in which the bank has bowed to pressure from the Israelis to cancel the account of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. This is absolutely appalling. Now we have the new Israeli ambassador apparently saying he cannot guarantee that the Israeli secret services will not use Irish passports in assassination attempts. I am relying on newspaper reports for this. It is horrendous and the Israeli ambassador should be called in and given a pretty severe talking to. I propose to table a motion critical of the Bank of Ireland for doing this and hope Sinn Féin will support it. It is extraordinarily undemocratic. This bank was rescued by the taxpayers of Ireland. It is acting in this arbitrary and undemocratic manner. It is a relatively uncontroversial thing. We are not criticising the Israelis. It is up to them if they want to put pressure on - that is their right. However, for an Irish bank to accede to it is disgraceful. I call on the Leader to consider giving time, even for an hour, to pass this as a measure of protest, although I need some time to formulate the motion. By the way, I apologise in advance. I may not hear what the Leader has to say because I have to do a radio interview, but I will try to get back in time.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	49	I agree with Senator David Norris and my colleagues in Sinn Féin on this matter. It is deplorable. It was a deplorable decision by Bank of Ireland. I am supportive of a motion being passed in the House criticising Bank of Ireland and calling on it to reverse its decision. It was wrong and there was no justification for it. I also want to raise an interesting issue that we need to be very careful of in the coming months. It relates to Palestine. In December 2008 there was a changeover of the American President. The opportunity was used and there was extensive bombing in the Gaza area. Over 1,300 people died. We need to send a clear message to Israel that the opportunity on this occasion from 15 December to 20 January should not be used in the same way as it was last time around. The outgoing United States President was not in charge in real terms and the incoming President had not taken over. The message needs to be highlighted that it will not be a free-for-all as it was in 2008. We need to be careful of this issue. I agree with my colleagues' comments on Bank of Ireland. At one stage the account in question had only €50,000 in it. It was purely for administration. It was a wrong decision by the bank.

A number of months ago a man in Ballinasloe was woken up by gardaí coming to his door. They took him out of his bed and brought him to prison in Dublin. Subsequently, when this was being challenged in the High Court, the Garda National Immigration Bureau backed out of the case. The man was subsequently deported to Brazil, where he was born. One might say that these things happen and that it is terrible, but this man was married to an Irish citizen. The grounds for his removal from the country, as I understand it, were based on misinformation given to the HSE about the status of his marriage. In recent times, the HSE has admitted that there were absolutely no grounds for the information given. Therefore, there was no reason whatsoever for his marriage not to be accepted as a proper and full legal marriage. To add insult to injury, the man is still in Brazil and the file on his case is still sitting on the desk of the Minister. His wife has had to go to Brazil to be with him. She has suffered extraordinary distress, as have her family and friends. It has affected all aspects of their lives, including the business that his wife runs. It is absolutely disgraceful that this should have been allowed to happen. It raises many questions about the procedures used by the HSE when it is given misinformation or spurious information. HSE staff acted on it against someone. They were in the wrong and did not give due process a chance. It also raises the question of whether the Garda National Immigration Bureau and Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service followed due procedure or checked the facts. All of this happened, even though the man in no way resisted any attempts to arrest him, etc. He gave the information that was correct. It was disregarded. His wife gave the same information. Nevertheless, those responsible proceeded to deport him. I am calling on the Leader to use his office to address this matter. If the Minister could be called in to debate the issue, I would be grateful. This is an immediate issue. I call on the Leader to intervene with the Minister's office, look at the file on the Minister's desk and give this man permission to come back to his wife, job and family in Ballinasloe. He should be allowed to continue his life with his wife, as he should have been allowed to do from day one. I imagine those involved will follow up themselves on the issues that pertain to the case and the way it was handled. It is disgraceful that this should have taken place. I call on the Government to act immediately to rectify the wrong.

It is a retrograde and a bad step. Some commentary has been positive but that has mainly come from the construction sector. Much of the commentary has been bad in respect of the scheme. If implemented, the scheme could lead to an extraordinary uptake of debt by individuals who wish to purchase a home. The scheme provides an incentive for people to take on debt. No Government should incentivise private individuals to take on debt by way of a scheme but that is what this scheme does. There is no incentive for people returning home. There is a total undermining of the Central Bank position on loan-to-value ratios and savings ratios. I can only guess that this initiative serves to undermine the Central Bank and to subvert it in respect of the savings initiative. The Central Bank did one thing in the aftermath of the financial crisis to try to help people. Many people have criticised the Central Bank for the limits of 10% or 20%. However, if the State subscribes to cultivating another housing boom, we are going to be back where we were before. That is wrong. This is going to push up prices on existing stock and it is going to help developers in parts of the country that are already over-housed. For example, in my county people cannot get a mortgage. How are they going to be able to avail of the scheme? The banks are simply not lending in certain parts of the country.The banks are only lending in areas where they know, through economic evaluations and models, they can sell on the property if the loan goes pear-shaped. Shame on the banks and, in particular, AIB, which is largely supported by the taxpayer. These are major issues which have not been addressed. This is feeding into a situation where increased lending rates internationally will cause a major crisis in the housing system again.

It was a major step forward for the agricultural community that, through the good work of the Minister, €150 million has been made available for low-cost finance. Loans from the scheme to provide working capital for the agriculture sector will have a low interest rate of 2.95%, a positive development. We have been looking for this for a long time. We have been on about the interest rate issue and the pillar banks. In Austria, farmers can get finance with an interest rate of 2%, but in Ireland one can pay anything up to 8%. The Minister has stepped into the market, making €150 million available in low-cost finance at 2.95%. This is an important day and has the ability to put cashflow and working capital back into this industry. That is what it required. Grain and dairy farmers have been looking for working capital for the past 12 months. We have a unique opportunity with this scheme. I encourage everyone in the agriculture sector to get involved in the scheme because it has the potential to lift us out of this crisis and, I hop, put us on a footing to go forward. The agriculture industry has the ability to repay and become a major driver in the economy.

I am very much against this. I was disappointed last night to see the head of the Restaurants Association of Ireland on Twitter mocking trade unionists who legitimately campaigned for the rate to be reviewed. I know that there is a new tradition in Fine Gael of mocking trade unionists. They had a good laugh at the weekend with their guest at their nice dinner.

The Restaurants Association of Ireland gains hundreds of millions of euro in subsidies each year, while it refuses to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission and the joint labour committee, JLC, system, re-established by the previous Fine Gael Government. It is an organisation, with the Irish Hotels Federation, which has effectively casualised employment in the whole industry. It is not possible to have a career in the hotel industry anymore, unless one is a manager, because one will only get a casual contract. This applies across all of the best hotels.

She was sacked simply for being a trade unionist. This was found out in an adjudication hearing at the Workplace Relations Commission. I understand the Irish Hotels Federation is now raising a fund to appeal that decision. These organisations are completely hostile to decent working rights in the sector. It is high time we had a proper debate on this matter. Will the Leader organise one? Will he also clearly condemn the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland for their refusal to engage with the JLC system?

It is certainly one for which it should answer. Despite some thinking we do not have a role to play in the day-to-day management of accounts, the bank should explain and, if possible, reverse this decision. I would also be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter of insurance which was also raised by Senators. Many Senators referred to the budget. To be fair to Senator Catherine Ardagh, she has been consistent on the importance of the funding and staffing of the DEIS, delivering equality of opportunities in schools, programme and how it is maintained and retained in some cases. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, was in the Chamber last week to debate the action plan for education, at which time he demonstrated his vision for the Department. Given that the economy is beginning to recover and more people are back at work, we need to examine how DEIS status is granted in the areas in Dublin to which Senator Catherine Ardagh referred and a number in my city of Cork. I will be happy to have the Minister return to the House to debate the matter. Senators Rose Conway-Walsh and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin referred to class sizes. It was announced yesterday in the Budget Statement that 2,400 extra teachers would be hired, an increase of 3.5%. There will be up to 2,500 additional posts in schools, including resource teachers and special needs assistants, as well as the return of career guidance teachers. Up to €160 million will be committed in the higher education sector. Education is pivotal in how we get the economy moving again. We must invest in it. The supports announced in the Budget Statement represent a beginning. Linked with them is the action plan for education and the new action plan for disadvantaged schools, to which Senator Catherine Ardagh referred and which the Minister will announce before the end of the year. There is also to be reform of the junior cycle programme, as well as extra career guidance posts. We are on a journey. We have haemorrhaged many staff from public services. At least we have now turned the corner in terms of investment. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, announced a comprehensive child care package, with an investment of up to €1.3 billion. Funding for early years education services has been increased by 35% to €466 million. A new affordable child care scheme will be introduced, with an increase in the Tusla budget. There is investment in children, particularly in younger years education programmes. Those who question the child care budget should look at the balanced and fair statement issued on it by the Children's Rights Alliance. Most people who discussed the budget on the airwaves this morning spoke about the housing scheme. Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill did not mention the issue of supply. Those of us who hold clinics and canvass meet people who have an issue in getting into the housing market or being able to obtain local authority housing. We need to start to incentivise the market to allow people to buy houses rather than compete against one another. However, I take the Senator's point which we may be able to address with the relevant Minister in the context of the Finance Bill. It is important that the benefit of a house purchase scheme go to the buyer, not the seller. I agree with the point made about the purchase of second-hand houses and the Central Bank's requirements regarding deposits. However, there are people who cannot put the money together and we must provide an incentive for them. There is still a home improvement scheme in place. As I said, we are on a journey, but it is equally important that we be fair and balanced in how we address the issues involved. Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin referred to the provision of free GP care for children under 12 years. As Members know, the Government's overarching policy is to provide free GP care for children under 12 years. There are talks under way with GPs on contracts. Senator Catherine Ardagh referred to a free dental cleaning and oral hygiene service.It is regrettable that we have not seen any movement on the matter. As part of Mary Hanafin's regime when Minister, the option was removed. It is important that we consider the issue in future years because dental work and good oral hygiene are important. Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the important issue of broadband provision. I will be happy to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to come to the House for a debate on the matter. Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn referred to cross-Border health initiatives. When I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the committee visited the North where we witnessed close co-operation. We can see that close co-operation in the link between Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry and Letterkenny General Hospital in County Donegal. We all welcome cross-Border health initiatives. Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn also made a point about transport, infrastructural developments and projects, a matter also raised by Senator Frank Feighan. Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn mentioned the A5 road project. I will be happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to attend the House to discuss the matters raised. Senator Frank Feighan also raised the matter of extending free travel to 18-year-olds across Europe. It is an exciting initiative that would afford students who have just left school an opportunity to travel and encourage them to explore. Senator Colm Burke raised the important issue of what might happen after the presidential election in the United States, particularly in the context of Israeli and Palestinian conflict. It is critical that President Obama's overseas policy be continued. Senators have differing views on Israel and Palestine, but it is important to recognise that the Palestinian people should not be subjected to harassment and torture. Whoever occupies the White House has a duty and an obligation to the world. I am not familiar with the case referred to by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh. If what he has said has happened, it presents a serious issue. Therefore, he should convey the details to the Minister.

As he rightly said, that is what is required. In response to Senator Paul Gavan, I am on record as saying the 9% VAT rate is important. We must continue to attract tourists post-Brexit. It is not about incentivising restaurants and hotels but offering an attractive package to tourists. What is of equal importance is that people who live here can afford to go to restaurants and spend their money in the local economy. I would be disappointed if a person working in the hotel industry was sacked because of his or her membership of a trade union or for being a trade unionist. Those of us who were members of and advocates for a union or who were shop stewards and representatives who attended branch meetings recognise the importance of and need for trade unions. I hope the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation will engage with the unions involved. As it is dialogue, not a monologue, both sides should interact. The Senator is right that for some employment in the hotel industry can be transient. There have been issues, in family-run hotels in particular, but the position has changed. It is important that people be offered continuity of employment in restaurants and hotels in particular. I, therefore, actively encourage both sides to engage. As I said, I would be disappointed if someone was sacked because of his or her membership of a trade union.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	69	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill. It gives us a great opportunity to convey our views, as Senators, on the reform of Seanad Éireann, the way it will progress and how it will work for the next 20, 30, 40 and 50 years. It is also important that we take stock of where we are. Nowhere was the way the Seanad is viewed by the public and organisations expressed better than in the past couple of weeks.Senator Michelle Mulherin will not thank me for raising one incident in particular which showed clearly how the Seanad is viewed by certain organisations. The Senator highlighted publicly, as an instance of discrimination against Members of this House, a letter she received from the GAA indicating that Deputies would be offered tickets for sale for the all-Ireland football final, but Senators would not. I got the same letter and I fully subscribe to the Senator's view on the matter. I understand any Member of this House from a participating county who sent in a letter and cheque received the same response. The GAA proceeded to roll out its former president and current MEP for the Ireland South region, Seán Kelly, who said the organisation had to draw a line somewhere. It certainly drew a clear line between Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann in this case. To make matters worse, RTE's Mary Wilson, in an interview with Senator Michelle Mulherin, observed that the latter was only a Taoiseach's nominee, as if to say Members nominated to the House in this way are different from other Members. In my time in the Seanad we have had several Members nominated by the Taoiseach who also worked in the media, including former Senators Eoghan Harris and Maurice Hayes, the latter going on to co-author the Manning report. None of those people was treated in any way differently by his or her colleagues. I can say with certainty that Taoiseach's nominees are not treated differently in this House. This particular incident affords us an opportunity to take stock of how we are viewed by the GAA and the media. In advance of the biggest day in the Gaelic football calendar, the GAA drew a clear line between the Dáil and the Seanad. Moreover, the Cathaoirleach was likewise discriminated against because he is the only officeholder who is not invited to be seated in the ard chomhairle in Croke Park on all-Ireland final day, with all the Ministers, Ministers of State, Garda and Army officials. All the other arms of State are represented there on these occasions but not the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann. The Bill and the recommendations in the Manning report will not change any of that. There will still be Taoiseach's nominees and this House will remain subordinate to the other House. The actions of the GAA squarely set out how we are viewed as a House of Parliament. The people who drafted the 1937 Constitution could not have envisaged what would happen in this Seanad. They could not have foreseen a scenario in which everybody would be represented, including the diaspora. We have lawyers, doctors, farmers, shopkeepers, business people and members of the media. A range of political parties is represented, as well as Independents. Moreover, no party or group has outright control in the Chamber. The drafters of the Constitution could not have envisaged an Upper House better than we currently have. Notwithstanding the proposals in Senator Michael McDowell's Bill or in the Manning report, the reality is that we will not achieve a better representation than we currently have. We will not get more organisations or parties than we have today. This Bill will make way for hundreds more organisations to put forward nominees, but it remains a fact that there can only be 60 people appointed. With no party having outright control, we are in the ideal position in this Seanad to make changes to how we do business. Instead, we seem to be putting the cart before the horse. We could go ahead and implement every provision in Senator Michael McDowell's Bill and every recommendation in the Manning report - many of them would not even require legislation - but there is little point in so doing if we do not have the necessary resources and funding. For example, there are only four members of staff for Seanad Éireann, two of them are almost always seated beside the Cathaoirleach. People can put forward whatever proposals they like, but unless there is backup funding, we cannot do what is proposed in the Manning report or any other report or Bill. The current Seanad could not be any more diverse and is not controlled by any party. If the Government really is committed to reform, it should go about the business of giving more power to this House to scrutinise legislation and deal with the various matters as recommended in the Manning report. The working group recommended, for instance, that the Seanad give particular attention to North-South Ministerial Council proposals and secondary EU legislation, consult with relevant bodies prior to and during Second Stage debates, investigate and report on matters of public policy interest, and consider reports from regulators and other statutory inspectors. Senator TerryLeyden has repeatedly called for a role for this House in the scrutinising of EU legislation, a proposal I fully support. It cannot be done, however, because the Dáil will not allow it. Instead, the other House has decided the European committee will deal with European legislation and scrutiny, with other committees also having a role. The view, apparently, is that we cannot have the same work being done by a committee and the Seanad, thus making the proposal a non-starter. Another proposal was that we might have a role in pre-legislative scrutiny, with Ministers presenting heads of Bills to the House for discussion before a potential redrafting of the legislation prior to Second Stage. However, as soon as it was decided to implement a pre-legislative process, that function went straight to a Dáil committee. The last Member of this House to chair a committee of both Houses was Pat Magner back in the mid-1990s. It seems there is no person in this House good enough to be Chairman of any of the 15 or 16 joint committees. As I said, most of the various proposals for Seanad reform could be implemented without ever changing the legislation. What is required, however, is a commitment by Government to provide the resources and staff necessary to do the work. The Acting Chairman has indicated my time is up. This Bill will put an enormous cost on the Exchequer - certainly €30 million, which is a substantial sum, and perhaps as much as €50 million. It will see the franchise extended to nearly half the world in order to have the same groups, organisations and parties represented here. We cannot have real change without a commitment to give more funding to enable us to do the business that is proposed to be done. We could start doing that work in the morning if there was the necessary commitment.

Much is said about the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the damage it has done to Irish women over the years, but the seventh amendment to the Constitution is another interesting one that rarely raises any comment. The interesting thing about the seventh amendment to the Constitution is that it was never legislated for. It was an attempt to widen the franchise for voters in Seanad elections. In the almost 40 years since there have been quite a number of commissions and reports. There was a referendum a number of years ago to abolish this Chamber, which I supported at that point. I remember debating with Senator Michael McDowell at the time at an event where we took opposing views on it. Both our positions have changed over the years. It was my interaction with this Chamber as Minister of State that changed my view on its validity and what it has to offer. There comes a stage where we have to put an end to the endless round of commissions and reports and actually do something. The issue with this Chamber is the perceived or otherwise disconnect between it and the electorate. This Bill tries to address that in many ways. There is potential in the Chamber to give a voice to people in society who do not often get a chance to have their voices heard. Much has been said about the diaspora and Irish citizens in the North of Ireland, but I am thinking also of groups such as Travellers and others who would benefit greatly from having representation in this Chamber on matters that concern them. One issue that concerns me in the Bill is the ability of an Oireachtas Member to be also a member of a local authority. Often in this Chamber Members speak about their constituency. Technically we do not have a constituency because we come into the Chamber as national politicians. We do not have a geographical constituency. If we were to go back to the situation where local authority members could run for the Seanad and have a dual mandate, we would dilute the national focus of the Chamber. Inevitably county council and city council issues would be brought to the floor of the Seanad. That happens anyway but it would be compounded by a situation where there is not that separation. One of the positive moves of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, was to propose the abolition of the dual mandate, which eventually became law in 2003. It provided that one could not be a Member of the national Parliament and a local authority member. It was very controversial at the time for people who were in that position and did not like it. It separated various areas of local administration and public representation. Council work was taken up by councillors and national work and national legislation were taken on by Oireachtas Members. I would have to be convinced that to go back to a situation where Senators could be local authority members is a positive move. In terms of what we are trying to achieve in the House, we work quite well together when we speak with one voice. I am keenly aware that politics is under more international pressure now. There is more pressure now on the validity of public life, the ability to make a case, and the ability to believe in something and stand for something than there has been ever before. Looking at what is happening in the United States, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, it appears to me that politics is in a complete mess. The fault for that lies with politicians and the political system. If we lose faith in the institutions of our political system, we are in a very dangerous position. We can see what is happening in the United Kingdom, where a very nasty scenario has arisen. I mentioned the United States and Europe also. When we change the way we do business in the Oireachtas, we have to proceed with caution, although there has been so much caution around this Chamber that it has led to nothing happening. I suggest the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and Senators take this Bill in good faith. We can work on its various elements as we proceed. If the Chamber is to have any validity in the future, its connectivity with the public has to be reinforced. I question the ability of a Senator in this House to have a dual function in a local authority because, if we are to be serious about national politics and talk about national issues, having a focus on the local authority area would not be a good move.

I am the first representative of those interests to have been afforded a voice in the Houses of the Oireachtas. At a time when our neighbours across the sea are retrenching from European partnership, when the party of Abraham Lincoln in the United States is calling for borders to be closed and trade links severed, now is the time for Ireland to send a message and reach out to its community across the globe. I can think of no better way of demonstrating to the Irish diaspora that Ireland wants it to be part of the State and our community than expanding the franchise of this House and building a Seanad that can have a meaningful impact, not just on these shores but much further afield. When the Irish people voted to preserve the Seanad in 2013, they did not do so out of any true affinity to how this House operated. The people gave the Houses of the Oireachtas the clearest mandate they have ever received to reform the Seanad. We must look forward and this Bill is a leap in that direction. Giving Irish citizens with current passports living abroad the chance to be eligible to register and vote on a panel of their choice for the Seanad would give a clear voice to the Irish emigrant community that I represent. It is estimated there are 3.1 million Irish passport holders living overseas. Affording them a vote in Seanad elections should be just the first step in redefining Ireland. A European Union without the United Kingdom, with which we have always shared common positions on trade, investment and taxation, will be one where Ireland needs to present itself as a nation of 70 million people and not as a small country on the periphery of Europe. The emigrant voice needs to be heard and we need to connect with that voice. Studies have shown that, over time, a 10% increase in immigration in a particular country is associated with a 1% increase of exports to that country and a 3% increase in imports from it. Networking and strengthening connections with the diaspora has consistently been shown to increase economic activity in the home country. Whether it is Israel becoming the world’s second largest venture capital market or India becoming a global technology hub, it is the diaspora strategies of those states that has been at the root of their success. We need to harness the Irish diaspora now more than ever to ensure more investment in this country, more jobs, and greater economic stability in the face of the inevitable economic winds this country will face as a result of Brexit. It is not just the economic benefits of providing the diaspora with representation in this House that should be considered but also the enormous cultural, political and social ties that have led to transformative changes in Irish society and that show why the diaspora deserve to vote for representatives of this House. Nowhere was this more evident than the same-sex marriage referendum where more than 70,000 returning emigrants were estimated to have flown home to vote and have their say in such a significant change to the country's social identity.Speaking in the Dáil in 1963, President John F. Kennedy summed up the interwoven fabric of the diaspora to the State’s development best when he said:If this nation had achieved its present political and economic stature a century or so ago, my great grandfather might never have left New Ross, and I might, if fortunate, be sitting down there with you. Of course, if your own President had never left Brooklyn, he might be standing up here instead of me.In describing the modern Ireland, he extolled the virtues of a truly global independent Ireland: For self-determination can no longer mean isolation; and the achievement of national independence today means withdrawal from the old status only to return to the world scene with a new one.His words have as much meaning today as they did in 1963. Ireland must stand on its two feet on the global stage and we need our diaspora to achieve that. I commend all those who have worked on this Bill and it is my sincere hope Dáil Éireann and this Seanad can see swift passage of the reforms in the Bill, empowering the diaspora with a vote and sending a clear message to Ireland's global community that we are listening and that we want their voices to be heard now more than ever.

I begin by thanking the Members of the Seanad reform working group and Senator Michael McDowell for drafting this Bill and also for the work which proceeded it. I thank them for their efforts in putting it into place. No doubt it is an interesting Bill and there are some fine aspects to it, but I suggest there are also many snags. People voted in the 2013 referendum to keep the Seanad, which showed a belief in the effectiveness and importance of this legislative arm. To honour the faith of the populace, it is important to keep the integral features of the House, while ensuring it operates effectively. The Bill, however, focuses almost entirely on the electorate with little emphasis on the processes of this House. The concept behind the vocational panels underpinning the Seanad electoral system has merit in bringing forward candidates who are genuinely from a particular business, professional or union background. I would have concerns, however, about additional eligibility requirements that the Bill imposes on nominating bodies, one of which is to have in place a set of corporate governance rules. This needs to be examined in the light of existing governance rules for nominating bodies. It is also fair comment that we are building a barrier to potential candidates by requiring seven years' experience in their chosen field, let alone adding another step to the nominating process. In terms of providing votes for Irish citizens overseas which, in theory, is laudable, I am not entirely convinced. I am on the record of the House previously as being a firm believer in no representation without taxation. It would be challenging to introduce and manage. Should someone who has not lived in this country for perhaps 40 years have a say in the make-up of the national Parliament? There are certainly practical issues that would arise in any significant extension of the voter franchise and these should be considered before we take steps to allow overseas voting. When one examines who is eligible to vote under this Bill, the estimated Seanad electorate would increase to some 5.3 million people from an original 120,000. I can be corrected if I am wrong about that. This would naturally dilute the role that the local authority members play in deciding the membership of Seanad Éireann - they would be reduced to 13 seats. Presently, 43 seats in the Seanad are elected by members of local authorities throughout the country together with the incoming Deputies and outgoing Senators. This electorate represents a direct and significant link between local communities and the Oireachtas. This is an important connection between local democracy and the national Parliament. The proposed Seanad electoral commission will replace the existing Seanad returning office, which, as my colleague pointed out, has very few staff. Will it be able to handle the projected 5.3 million voters? Where are the financial estimates on the proposed Seanad electoral commission and the burden it would place on the taxpayer? As I see it, there are some other snags also. Candidates would have to apply for one of the five vocational panels and even at that it could be very lop sided. One might have a huge number on one panel and not many on another. Obviously, it will not be evenly spread because candidates will have to apply and opt for a particular panel, and that will be as a result of regulations with the consent of the Taoiseach. There is a pre-Seanad electoral commission and then there is the Seanad one. The Senator can correct me if I am wrong about that also when he is winding up. There will be a different returning officer for each vocational constituency and also one or more returning officers for the institutions of higher education. I understand it will be one constituency as a result of the referendum that took place in 1979, a decision which no Government has put into effect. In applying for inclusion on the electoral register, under the Bill a person may express a preference for the constituency in respect of which he or she plans to cast his or her vote. As I say, one could have many people opting for one or two panels and maybe not so many for the others. I am not sure about the balance between them. I understand the desire to extend the franchise to Irish citizenship, and there is also the question of allowing more people to apply for a valid Irish passport - there will be some fun with this. There will be a ballot paper in electronic form for printing and a unique identifier for each individual, and the ballot papers will have a unique QR code printed on them. One could have fraud and all sorts involved here because it will be communicated through the post which will not be registered, although that is probably not too important. It imposes a huge responsibility on the Taoiseach of the day in deciding on this electoral commission. There will be an interim electoral commission and then there will be another one established, presumably when it is necessary. As Senator Paddy Burke said, there will be a significant financial imposition in that regard. We may have to suffer that, if it is the right thing to do when the time comes, but we will have some interesting times teasing this out on Committee Stage.

It is certainly a Bill that will encourage much debate in the House and reflection on the role of Seanad Éireann. One aspect baffles me in that, since the recession, the only institute of democracy within the State to come under the microscope of reform has been Seanad Éireann. Other institutions of State, including Dáil Éireann, how the Executive or the Cabinet forms its powerful position and local authorities have not been given the same scrutiny in terms of reform, powers and democracy. It has been the easy option to kick Seanad Éireann and to look at reforming it. The Taoiseach opted for abolition in the famous speech that he gave at a Fine Gael dinner in 2012 and there was a referendum. My party was the only parliamentary party that opposed the abolition of Seanad Éireann. We strongly opposed its abolition because of the principle of democratic accountability and oversight. Doing away with the Seanad would obviously lead to a democratic deficit, by removing the second Chamber and allowing the Executive to have more power. In other words, it would centralise power. Subsequently, the 2014 local government reform legislation was brought forward by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, the objective of which was to reform local government. However, that objective has not been met. A number of studies of it have been carried out. I carried out as part of a master's of finance degree I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the 2014 local government reforms, which included research and survey analyses in respect of local authority members across the political spectrum. It is very clear that said legislation has halted democracy. It has centralised power in the Executive and away from councillors in the local government setting. Local government is starved of financial resources. The reforms were within the realm of efficiency, and we know what that means. Efficiency without effectiveness of services means that costs are being cut. That is what has happened. In the spirit of the reforms contained in the Bill before us, we support any reformation of Seanad Éireann that would make it more effective in its role. However, I have concerns, some of which have been expressed, about the manner in which the reforms are being brought forward, particularly those relating to the electoral process. I agree with Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin that the House has a major role to play at national, not local, level. The manner in which the Seanad is structured can instil a greater level of debate on and scrutiny of legislation than perhaps the Lower House because of the local and casework demands on Deputies. There is a need to examine the way we do our business. If we are serious about reform, the first change we should examine is the manner in which we do our work on a week-to-week basis and consider some of the aspects that have been touched upon, including the scrutiny of European legislation and sitting four days a week. That could be a good start. A report I read recently indicated that over 95% of the laws made in Brussels that impact on citizens in Ireland go unchecked. They are filtered through the parliamentary committee system but those committees, owing to their workload, often do not have the time to scrutinise such legislative proposals and demands from Brussels. We could start with that aspect. There is an all-Ireland agenda which has to be developed in a better way, particularly in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. Those are matters in respect of which we could introduce reforms. The electoral reform of the Seanad is another area. I would be slow to disenfranchise local government any further by reducing the democratic power of local authority members in electing Seanadóirí to the House. There is another difficulty - political theorists, not just in Ireland but in other jurisdictions also, have reflected on this - where the same person has two votes to elect people to either Chamber. For example, the electorate would have a vote to elect a Member to Dáil Éireann and the same person would have a vote to elect a different person to Seanad Éireann. There are issues in that regard and it is a matter on which we need to reflect. Regarding the Taoiseach's nominees - I welcome Senator Billy Lawless who is here representing the diaspora - the Taoiseach and my party leader made excellent choices this time around in selecting Seanadóirí, particularly those from sectoral interest groups. We can criticise that and say it is undemocratic for the Taoiseach to do so, but it was Éamon de Valera who changed the manner in which 11 Members were nominated by the Taoiseach. I have been critical of this in the past, but that is not to say that in the future party politics would be the dominant feature in terms of the way a Taoiseach would put forward his or her 11 nominees. That process has to be changed. If we are to elect people representing the diaspora abroad, there should be one Seanadóir elected. I know the structure is different in the Bill, but these are issues we can tease out on Committee Stage. We will not object to the completion of the Second Reading of the Bill today, but we reserve the right to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage. I emphasise that local government in this country which is the point of democracy closest to the citizen is actually the weakest in Europe. We should not be proud of that. We will disenfranchise local government further if we remove the power of local authority members to elect 43 Senators. We have to examine the overall picture and not just engage in a knee-jerk reaction. I am all for political transformation and reformation, but it cannot be done on its own. It must be done in the round. There is a need to reform the way we do politics in this country and make decisions about spending public money, but we cannot do that in a knee-jerk fashion. Yesterday's Budget Statement was an opportunity to reform more areas, but it did not occur. We had a massive opportunity to carry out major reforms in the aftermath of the financial crisis of the past five years when there was a strong Government in power. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Some good things were done, particularly in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but much more needs to be done, particularly around value for money. As politicians, we often say we should spend more. All political parties want more to be spent, including those that criticise the Government. However, what is the point in spending more if we are not getting value for money for what is currently being spent? There are issues in that regard. This goes back to the power of the Executive, the debate in the Dáil and the debate in the Seanad - they are all interlinked. Local government has been reduced, with 80 town councils brought out of the equation and democracy, at the point closest to those councils, removed. This has resulted in a further centralisation of power. What has happened at local government level is that the power has been centralised to the county manager and away from councillors who were democratically elected. We should not rush to reform Seanad Éireann because it is popular to do so. We have to look at the overall picture if we are serious about reform. We can be populist about reform, but we have to be serious about it.

I am not sure that helps in terms of the optics. Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill on Seanad reform. We campaigned in the referendum in 2013 for it to be abolished, but the people made their decision and we respect that. Why, three years later, has there been no significant reform of this House despite all the talk at the time that the Seanad would work in a new way and be given more scrutinising powers? I am proud to be a Seanadóir in this House, as, I am sure, are the other Seanadóirí. This is an important arm of the Oireachtas where I can give a voice to the ordinary people on a daily basis. We are all honoured and privileged to find a job that matches our passion and to perform it in our daily lives. However, there are still many flaws in the operation and formation of the Seanad. That is why I welcome the Bill as it has many elements which have the capacity to make reforming changes which were demanded by the electorate following the referendum on its abolition. This Seanad is probably the most diverse in history in terms of the various opinions of Members. That is what makes it an interesting debating House.The reason for this diversification is the sea change in the electoral landscape of previous years, which has allowed greater representation from all sectors of society. This is good for the country and our democracy. More can be done to make the Seanad an even truer reflection of society and the Bill will allow for it. Allowing 30 of the 60 Members to be elected by popular vote is a move that we welcome. The electorate proved it is interested in the Seanad and recognises its worth to our democratic system. Therefore, it is most welcome, as part of the Bill, that the public should be given a direct say in who is elected to it, that is, a choice to elect who they want to represent them. Embracing our fellow citizens and holders of Irish passports from the North is also very welcome. We have campaigned for a long time for voting rights for our fellow citizens in all elections that take place in the Republic. We believe it is only a matter of time before it happens and we look forward to a time when we will have representatives from the Six Counties in a Thirty-two County Dáil Éireann. Brexit is a great opportunity to do it. On that note, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, who became the first Sinn Féin Senator to join us from the Six Counties, despite not even being able to vote in the election. We are very proud of him. Allowing the members of the diaspora to vote is also a very important step in keeping a link with our citizens who are forced to or otherwise leave the country and seek new opportunities elsewhere. We should never forget them and their links with the country. This proposed step would include them in our democratic process. Allowing more of our graduates to have a say through the university panel would also be a progressive step. Exclusivity was part and parcel of the Seanad for far too long. The public rightly had a negative view of the House and its operation as a closed shop inhabited by fuddy-duddies. The position in that regard has changed dramatically in recent years, which has been positive for our democracy. Our House - the people's House - has a positive role to play into the future. Many good people and positive contributors have come through the Seanad and many more will come through in the future. The Seanad could take on many extra responsibilities that would make a positive contribution to Irish society. I liken the House to a family in which the maturing children are demanding from their parents more responsibility and the opportunity to move on, embrace ideas and have their say. I support the Bill, but reiterate that three years is a long time to wait for reform.

Long after the fanfare of general elections and posters, my best friend's house across the road would be flooded with election literature for the Seanad. I often wondered, and asked, why it was absent from our letter box. Obviously, my father went to work at Guinness at the age of 15 years and did not go to college. Neither did my mother. Young people and children listen and I, as a Senator, remain conscious of that inequality. This insight as a child forever informs my understanding of the House. In October 2013 the people rejected the referendum proposal to abolish the Seanad. However, all participants and parties involved in the referendum were clear in saying the Seanad, in its current form, is elitist, undemocratic and unacceptable. In the discourse that has developed, the result is not viewed as a vote to retain the Seanad in its current form. The House must become fully inclusive, representative, relevant and accountable. After the referendum, the Taoiseach and the Government committed to reform the political system and to ensure the Seanad was a modern and effective second Chamber, yet, as we have heard from across the House, progress and change have yet to be achieved. The Seanad was created under the 1937 Constitution and, in the decades since, with few honourable exceptions, it has become synonymous with cronyism and corruption, particularly on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party. It used the system of political nominees to reward close political allies. The Seanad is also used as a safety net for those who fail to get elected to the Dáil. At no point has the Seanad provided a genuine check on the actions of the Government. Surely we can facilitate the direct election by way of universal franchise of all citizens on the same day as a Dáil vote. Surely Northern Ireland and diaspora representation could be the norm. Surely 50% of the representation in the House could be women. Surely groups in Irish society that are traditionally marginalised could be guaranteed representation. Given the many positive aspects of the Bill, Sinn Féin will support it.

I have listened, here and via the monitor in my office, to what many of the speakers have said. There is a real appetite for reform and an acknowledgement that there are deficiencies in the Seanad as it stands, particularly in terms of what the report describes as elitist and one which disenfranchises so many citizens. This must be addressed. The previous speaker highlighted his experience of it. The fact that so many third level institutions are excluded from the university panel electorate is not healthy. The absence of clear and defining guidelines or public understanding of the Seanad's distinctive role must be addressed. While I agree with a large number of the good points in the report, many need to be further explored and examined. I believe in the comment that a reformed Seanad must be seen by Irish citizens as having a legitimate voice and a role in the political process and that it should have adequate powers and functions. However, I will return to it regarding what it might mean depending on the level of access a diaspora would and should have. I agree with the concept. The Seanad is enriched by the presence of Senator Billy Lawless and our Sinn Féin representative from Northern Ireland. However, there is a major issue to be explored. Other speakers have discussed the logistics of achieving it. I refer, for example, to how all Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland and elsewhere around the world would be informed and how arrangements would be made to enable them to vote. The diaspora is not very different, in terms of being information technology, IT, savvy, from many of our own people. Many of them are older individuals who may not be IT savvy. The report alludes to county libraries making IT available. How would this be done with people abroad? I particularly think of many of our countrymen and countrywomen residing in the United Kingdom who went abroad and sent money home but find themselves in situations of hardship that make it difficult for them to access such facilities or have a full understanding of them. As other speakers said, there is so much more the Seanad could do. Scrutinising EU legislation is one example. The report alludes to committee work and bringing people before the Seanad. How would it impact on our existing committees? As somebody who was involved in the successful pre-legislative scrutiny of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which was held here in this Chamber, I wonder how we would manage the process without duplication and conflict with the committee system, which has worked well. Pre-legislative scrutiny is a very important process and I am very pleased that it has become standard. I think the principle of one person, one vote is certainly something to which most of us subscribe. I have heard what speakers have said about the power of local government and the concern about its further undermining. I believe there is a problem there in terms of the powers local authority representatives have and their ability to exercise those powers and a shift away from them to the more permanent office or board of management. That certainly is something that requires examination and needs to be addressed. This is not a criticism of the management, which I believe does great work on our behalf.  I do not want to spend too long going through the report. It says Seanad Éireann lacks a distinctive identity, too closely reflects that of Dáil Éireann and fails to realise the constitutional ambition to create a largely vocational Chamber. It speaks about achieving more balance of vocational representation and educating people. A bit that really disturbs me says that the level of knowledge and practical experience required of candidates in the Constitution should be defined in legislation. I would be very worried about that. It smacks of more elitism.

All I have to do is keep encouraging him and he will keep doing it. The ninth recommendation of the working group talks about giving consideration to North-South Ministerial Council proposals; giving consideration to secondary legislation of the European Union, which has been touched on; consulting relevant bodies prior to and during Second Stage debate, which I believe will cause problems; and investigating and reporting on matters of public policy interest, which I believe we already do. Much of the stuff that has been mentioned can be done without necessarily passing a Bill, as Senator Paddy Burke noted.  I believe we are going to have a serious issue around how we can have representation without residency or taxation. A total of 5.5 million people who do not reside in or pay taxes here could influence policy that would impact on the day-to-day lives of the citizens who live here without any consequences for them. That is not in any way to demean the value of the diaspora, which is very important to us not just from the point of view of creating more jobs and more industry but from a cultural point of view and all it has done for us. It is more a case of how we get that balance right between those we want to involve and the powers of this Seanad in respect of how it impacts on national policy. I believe there needs to be an input, but we have an awful lot of work to do to investigate how to get that balance right in order that the citizens who live and pay their taxes here and suffer the consequences of policy do not feel disenfranchised by a larger number of the diaspora which would have an input into that process. This is something that requires far more examination.  When I was a Minister, one feature of this House I found hugely useful and helpful related to commencing legislation. Many of the things to which Senator Paddy Burke referred and the issue of starting more Bills in this House can be done without necessarily waiting for this Bill to complete its passage and for the reform of the Seanad to take place. Many of the things we could do that would improve the working of the House and create far more relevance for the people can be done without necessarily waiting for this. I welcome the Bill in terms of the debate it has generated.

I compliment Senator Michael McDowell on pushing the Bill forward. When I became a Senator, he was one of the first people to whom I spoke about the Bill and he was very insistent on getting support for it. I also second the points made by Senator Billy Lawless about the Irish diaspora, of which I was a member for 20 years. I think I was more Irish abroad than I am in my own country. I support most of what the Senator said. Ireland is almost unique in not allowing even a bare level of voting access for the recently emigrated and it is my hope the Bill will go some way towards remedying that problem. My approach to this Bill is one of frustration that the reform of this archaic Chamber has taken so long and that this issue has not advanced more since we introduced it in July. I respect the points made by Senator James Reilly but, nevertheless, diversity is strength and movement. We need to move on with things. We cannot just think and debate forever. We need to put things into effect. The Manning report was the 12th such review of the powers and make-up of the Seanad. We have been debating its powers and electoral process for most of the history of the Republic. We passed a referendum to expand its democratic mandate through the enlargement of the university panel franchise by an overwhelming 92% as far back as 1979. It still has not been acted on. Having been a student of Waterford Institute of Technology, I have no vote in the process. Previous processes have been far too slow and even less effective. Reforming the Seanad was voted one of the most pressing concerns by the Constitutional Convention, second only to greater environmental protection. The Irish people voted to keep and reform the Seanad three years ago this month and we have still to make that a reality. This Bill is not perfect. The Green Party position would be to more radically change the nature of the Seanad to make it the primary body that scrutinises EU legislation with even greater freedom from Government dominance than that provided for in this Bill. We would like to see the Seanad have more power than it currently has to imbue it with greater importance not just by changing the way it is elected but by increasing public focus on its work by making it more crucial to the legislative process. We want to change the way business is handled and to expand its functions to include the development and facilitation of participative democratic functions. Some of this would necessitate a change to the constitutional nature of the Seanad but much can be achieved once the newly restructured Seanad outlined in this Bill is made a reality.  It is my belief that the Seanad can be a greater Chamber. There are plenty of examples of Senates around the world that play a crucial role in their democracies. The Australian Senate has long provided a crucial control in respect of the see-saw politics of the two-party system of the lower chamber there, while also allowing for the representation of alternative views. In much of Europe and elsewhere, Upper Houses have facilitated federalism and positive decentralisation. Although the US Senate has been undergoing some tough reputational times, it has often lived up to its reputation as the "greatest deliberative body in the world". Well structured upper chambers can play a key role in modern democracies holding governments and lower chambers to account and introducing new thought and new ways of doing business into the legislative process. In order to do this, some key characteristics are essential. They should be elected or composed in a different fashion from that of their respective lower chambers. They should make some effort to temper the partisan divisions that can dominate Lower Houses. They should be largely or completely popularly elected. They can also offer dedicated representation to groups in society that are otherwise under-represented. This Bill, in particular, does much on that front. The Seanad reform Bill that I have sponsored, with all of my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group, addresses many of these key concerns and lays out a vision of a more democratic and legitimate Seanad in line with its original intentions when it was conceived in the 1937 Constitution.The Bill will finally make a reality of the 1979 referendum result and democratise the university panels by merging them and admitting all Irish graduates into the franchise. The university panels have provided us with some of our more impressive political figures over the years, including Mary Robinson and Senators David Norris, Alice-Mary Higgins and Lynn Ruane. The University of Dublin panel in particular played a role in providing representation to minority communities during the early Republic. A reformed Seanad can play a similar role in finally granting those Irish forced to move abroad by the economic collapse some form of representation in their native political system through their inclusion in the Seanad voting panels, and with provision at long last of some form of national postal voting. That will bring us one step closer to ensuring we cherish all the children of the Republic equally. The Bill also finally restores the vocationality of the panels by requiring that candidates actually have some knowledge and experience of the topics they are elected to represent. It restores the balance towards the nominating bodies and away from the political parties in the Dáil. The Bill will create a renewed, more democratic and more informed Upper House and I urge all Senators and Deputies to give it their full support, as I intend to do.

I feel like a learner driver doing a driving test who might be struggling to get over the line and who wants to change the rules of the road as a result. I do not feel qualified to speak on Seanad reform as I am somebody who has just come in and still learning the process and procedures. When I see somebody like Senator David Norris in front of me, I feel even less adequate in speaking about it. Nevertheless, I see the need for reform. The last time I was asked a question about reform of the Seanad I had a ballot paper in my hand. To be accurate, the question was not about reform but abolition. It was a great pity that the question asked was "yea or nay, in or out, go or stay".

As a former councillor, I know the Seanad performs a great role and I would hate the vocational panels and input of councillors to be totally diminished to 13 seats. As a councillor, my greatest link with national politics and policy was through my interaction with Senators. Now, as a Senator, I see that role in reverse. The councillors of Ireland are at the coalface and they deal with the public. There is a very close relationship between the councillor and the Senator, more than with the Deputy, which in essence forms a link between these Houses and the people on the street and changing that would be detrimental. I must comment on my colleagues to my right. Once again, even in a debate of this nature, as a Fianna Fáil Member I had to take a snipe. I will not lower myself to snipe back and, in fact, will give a compliment. As Senator Máire Devine reminded us, Sinn Féin canvassed for the abolition of the Seanad, for which I thank them. If that party had canvassed for its retention, none of us would be here today. We owe the party a debt of gratitude. I really appreciate the contribution from Senator Billy Lawless and I am delighted that he is here. Nevertheless, I have a major issue with the Bill and the proposed inclusion of the overall diaspora and Irish passport holders. We have all shouted for boys in green in the Lansdowne Road stadium or what is now the Aviva who, when they arrived in Dublin Airport, may have had to get directions to the stadium. They had an Irish passport, but how Irish were they? There is a diaspora that is interconnected and not long gone, as well as some we would like to bring home. Giving them a vote for its own sake will not bring them home or give them any more of a connection with Ireland and how Irish governance is carried out. Today, we are discussing the giving of a vote in a Seanad election to up to 5 million people. We will still have vocational panels, where people will have a choice as to which panel they will work from. The logistics will not be possible. We could have a dry run for a presidential election, if possible, that would involve one ballot paper, and we could see how that works. I see the merits in the philosophy of including an entire diaspora - I agree with it to an extent - but the logistics in this scenario will not be possible. The way the proposal has been designed with the vocational panels, whereby people decide on which panel they wish to vote, is not possible. We could have a dry run with a presidential election involving one ballot paper to see how it goes. As I stated, I am only learning how this House works and should declare so far so good. I have been able to raise issues that I was not able to raise in the council chamber. I am thankful that in some, although not all, cases I have obtained positive outcomes. We have a major role to play in the analysis and scrutiny of European and national law, as has been mentioned. Where does that go? Perhaps our day could be more condensed and we could be more fruitful in what we do. The scheduling should be examined as much as how and why we got here. A Senator mentioned a knee-jerk reaction to reform in a contribution, but this is definitely the slowest knee-jerk reaction that could possibly happen. There is a need for reform and it is not a knee-jerk reaction. The Bill is to be welcomed and, although I will support it, I will keep my options open on Committee Stage, as my colleague noted. There will be a need for much scrutiny in much of the make-up of the Bill and there must be some amendments. In theory the Bill must be welcomed as there is a need for reform, although that should not just be for its own sake. It does not need to be the dramatic type of reform that seems to be the populist opinion. As was highlighted in the referendum about this Chamber, the populist opinion might not be the right one. In 2013, when politicians were to be kicked around the streets, who would have predicted the people of Ireland would vote to keep the Seanad? Nobody in their right mind could even imagine how anybody would vote for politicians at that time. The people have spoken and they want a Seanad. It is up to us, na Seanadóirí, to figure out how we do our business. I do not want to get carried away in how we decide to elect Senators and complicate matters. The last count I attended was so complicated, it was unreal. It is so complicated I did not even know I had been elected when it happened. From what I hear today, we are going to make this even more complicated. Perhaps I am reacting in a knee-jerk fashion, as I am still recovering from a campaign that hit the four corners of the country. I have a vision in my mind, with what is being spoken about here, of having to do a global campaign. We must think very strongly about how to include the diaspora. I have no problem with the idea in theory as it is a great idea. As some Senators have mentioned, I lived outside the country for some time. I was more Irish then and travelled for two or three hours in taxis to see Irish bands playing. If I had been at home and they were on the radio, I would have turned it off. The Irish diaspora can be more Irish than we are but we should not include them for the sake of it and complicate the process. One would not know what kind of Seanad we would end up with if 5 million people were voting. Some would wear green jerseys like the Irish soccer team players who did not know how to get to Lansdowne Road when they arrived in Dublin. What kind of Seanad would they elect?

It is the first Bill to which, with many others in the House, I have put my name as a Senator. I reiterate my strong support for its proposed reforms. Seanad Éireann has no mandate to continue in its current form. Every Senator sitting in the House following its retention by the Irish people in 2013 has a national mandate to campaign for significant change. The Bill is the final product of decades of reports, consultations and debate on what a reformed Seanad should look like. I am content as many of the criticisms levelled at the Seanad that it is possible to change within the current constitutional framework are addressed in it. This is a good and comprehensive Bill and I am proud to support it. I am sure we will all agree that a significant number of people believe they are not well represented in Irish politics. People see the infighting that has resulted from partisan and Government versus Opposition politics. They believe that the issues they care about and that affect them are lost in the fray and are the collateral damage of electoral competition. That is why ensuring the creation of a reformed and independently-minded Seanad is so important. The Seanad could be a forum for consensus, for cross-party policy-making and for the type of politics that focuses on citizens, not political point-scoring. Since the adoption of the Constitution in 1937, the people have been locked out of the Upper House of their Parliament. They have been kept at a distance, unable to participate and only able to observe. The Bill will open up the Seanad to the people and provide for another check and balance in policy-making and governance in this country. I am a strong believer in the idea of a fully participatory democracy. I believe in a democracy where every level of government constantly and consistently seeks new mandates from its citizens in the form of elections. That is why I have co-sponsored a Bill on the Order Paper to lower the voting age to 16 years in order to include young people in political decision-making. That is why, as president of Trinity College Dublin's students' union, I led voter registration drives that signed up tens of thousands of students to vote and thus ensure the greatest level of participation by as many people as possible in Irish democracy. I support the Bill because it will allow for a new forum where citizens can directly mandate their representatives to work on their behalf and express their vision for the future of the State. As politicians, we must support all efforts to build a stronger and more symbiotic relationship between politics and citizens. That is why I call on everyone in the House to support the Bill. My colleague, Senator David Norris, will have an opposing view on the following matter. I am a representative of the Trinity College Dublin constituency. I also campaigned to open up the university vote and was elected because people wanted to open up the Seanad to other universities.

I welcome the Bill. As a young fellow in County Clare, I always admired Senator Michael McDowell from a distance for his legal and political brain. I am not surprised that he champions Seanad reform. We have had other good champions in the Seanad, including Dr. Maurice Manning who lectured me when I studied politics at UCD for three years. UCD is where many people my age learned about politics, its intricacies and the value of the Seanad. As a UCD student, I came here as a guest of Dr. Maurice Manning. I sat in the Visitors Gallery and saw the workings of the Seanad at first hand. Like everyone else, I want Seanad reform but first we must check what works. We are quick to criticise ourselves and institutions, but we should consider what we have achieved in this Chamber. Some of the most influential people in Irish society have passed through this Chamber. We all know what Senator David Norris has achieved since the 1980s. His success is in no small part due to his membership of this House. If anybody suggested a reformed Seanad would not have somebody like him in it, I do not believe the people would want such a situation. We must be careful about how we pitch reform and what type of reform we embrace. The reform of local government was discussed for a long time and eventually it was reformed before the 2014 local elections. If one asks a current councillor, particularly one in a rural area, whether reform is good, he or she will reply in the negative and state that the municipal areas are too big and that the municipal district structure is broken, even though it was never right in the first instance. Also, the elimination of town councils came about on foot of a unilateral decision but many people would say swathes of urban Ireland are not represented at local authority level. I caution that we need reform but we must ensure that it is the right type of reform. I have only direct experience of Seanad Éireann since 2011. From what I have been told, the Seanad prior to 2011 was one of the best in recent history because former Senator Maurice Cummins was Leader of the House. Ge was prepared to push boundaries and do things differently. He brought in speakers, set up committees and considered ways to reform how the House conducted its business - all without a referendum.

That is a debate for another day. The Cathaoirleach has the pleasure of chairing the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, of which I am delighted to be a member. Its establishment was an initiative mooted by the previous Leader, former Senator Maurice Cummins. It was set up to examine and report on issues that affect Irish society and that are deeply held within the mindset of Irish people. One example is the groundbreaking farm safety report. It received national and international coverage in terms of pulling all the relevant stakeholders together. We advertised for submissions and received many. We opened the Seanad Chamber to between ten and 12 groups and they gave oral submissions. We based a report on all of the submissions and made significant recommendations. As one person involved in farm safety said, every time a line is written in the media about farm safety awareness is raised and, potentially, lives are saved. That is one initiative that was done in the absence of reform. I have no doubt that an awful lot more can be done in this Chamber without reform. Of course, we all want to see a lot more people partake in the electoral process. At the same time, I do not want the important and unique role played by councillors in electing Senators denigrated to a major extent either. I agree that the vocational panels are not as reflective as they could be.  I was nominated by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. I was elected to the Administrative Panel, which is supposed to reflect disabilities and voluntary community groups. I strongly represent the organisation that nominated me because I am legally blind, with just 16% eyesight.

I was nominated by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and elected to the disability panel. I am an example of somebody who reflects the panel to which I have been elected. I would like political parties to make a greater effort - they should be obliged to do so - to nominate people who reflect each type of panel. For example, the Agricultural Panel should deal with agricultural issues, but that is a broad church which includes environmental issues, food safety and marketing products made in Ireland. This country exports billions of euros worth of product as a result of agriculture and that makes the panel important. The Leas-Cathaoirleach was elected to the Industrial and Commercial Panel which he represents very well because of his background.

As politicians, we must always be critical of ourselves and want and strive to do better and make institutions better. Many more improvements can be made without reform. In 2014 the people voted to retain the Seanad.Many eminent people got involved in that campaign and pointed out what could and should be done and the people said they wanted a second Chamber. They wanted the Seanad to continue because there were people like former Senator Sean Barrett who put forward hundreds of amendments in the last Seanad. Many of them were accepted by Ministers. The then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, accepted one after another because former Senator Sean Barrett was recognised as being probably one of Europe’s greatest transport economists and knew what he was talking about. The Minister had the good grace to realise that his legislation would be vastly improved by accepting the amendments from people like former Senator Sean Barrett.

We have to respect that it is a different animal from the Dáil with a different but nonetheless important function. There are two aspects, first, electoral reform and how we elect Senators; and, second, how it operates and functions. We need to address both to achieve reform. The view of the public is that it does not get to vote on the Seanad and it wonders what the Seanad does, although when we had a referendum people wanted to keep it. There is a good case to extend the franchise on the basis that we need to have as much participation from people as possible. The proposal here is to extend the franchise to people with Irish passports, people in Northern Ireland and others living outside the State. The nation extends beyond the country’s boundaries; there are many who feel an intangible link that makes them feel Irish, no more so than when they are abroad and their identity is more challenged by contrast with other cultures. We stand very proudly over our culture. As a democracy, we should draw circles of inclusiveness. It is a healthy development in recent years that there has been more reaching out to the diaspora, not just for economic reasons. Those people have the same genetic history as us in general, although I know there are new Irish now. We can learn from the the diaspora and they from us. We celebrate when they succeed, in politics and business, as, for example, the Kennedys did, and we like to claim Barack Obama, rightly so. We are very proud.  I do not agree, however, with extending the franchise to people other than Irish citizens resident in the State. It would be important to have the diaspora represented here, but that could be achieved by Taoiseach’s nominees. There is a simple mechanism already. I am delighted that Senator Billy Lawless is here and that he contributes. He can give us the emigrant’s perspective. I know that he actively helps the young diaspora. An exception could be made for people who left in the past five or ten years. I agree with much of what Senator Paul Daly said. There is a real connection. For the most part I subscribe to the view that unless one is paying taxes in this country, one should not have the franchise for national or local elections.  I am concerned about the detail of how this would operate. The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned that over 5 million people who have Irish passports could have the franchise. The proposal for conducting elections through an e-mail to be printed, completed and sent back seems very casual compared with our approach to national elections and with the Seanad election as it operates now, local elections and referenda. There would be a lot of scope for personation. It is a fair and proper concern in the conduct of elections, to know that the outcome is a legitimate representation of the votes of people who were entitled to vote. This proposal cannot be stood over. What is the rationale for moving people from one panel to another when one is oversubscribed? A person may not have an interest in another panel or may not want to register. I could run on the education panel but if I cannot get onto it, I would have to get onto another. There could be an imbalance. The system is good. When I was a councillor, I received five papers and voted on all the panels. That is the best way to go. Does voting for the Seanad need to be scrutinised less than for other elections? The answer has to be "No".  The people spoke when they were asked if they wanted the Seanad to continue. I was not in favour of abolishing the Seanad. The people wanted a watchdog and that was the gist of their message. It does not need any great legislation or debate in here. Senator James Reilly, the former Minister for Health and for Children and Youth Affairs, spoke about this Bill. He was one of the few Ministers who allowed legislation commence in the Seanad. Why is that not happening? The Government has only five hours in the Dáil to put through legislation. That begs the question as to why more legislation is not commenced in the Seanad. Can somebody answer that question? This is not rocket science. Why does the Seanad not scrutinise EU legislation? This Bill is not reform. It is reform for more of the same. It will be unwieldy and the process will be confusing for those who wish to participate. Dividing the country into regions with one candidate from each will not be very balanced. All candidates may be from Dublin. I understand the tenor and intent behind this, but I can see trouble coming down the line. I see other problems in the legislation that I do not have time to deal with now, but I will do so on the next Stage.There is a lot of hoo-ha being made about reform. I agree with the Sinn Féin Senator, Senator Máire Devine. Why has it not happened? It can happen right now and that would be meaningful in terms of the operation. I agree with Senator Paddy Burke who stated we were putting the cart before the horse. Is this for real?
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	112	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and thank him for his presence and contribution to the debate. I compliment Senator Michael McDowell on putting the Bill before us and thank former Senators Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole, for their immense work in preparing the report of the working group on Seanad reform. While it is important to recognise that there was a referendum and that the people voted 52% to 48% to retain the Seanad, the fundamental question we should ask is a little like the one a person would hear when watching "Grand Designs" or Mr. Dermot Bannon on "Room to Improve". From where would we start from? The fundamental question I would pose, while not opposing reform, which is needed, is why we are starting with this Bill at this stage when the Taoiseach, after his visit to this House in September, has asked for an implementation group to be put together and on which he has written to the party leaders. I am not sure whether the Taoiseach has written to Senator Michael McDowell. At one level, we are ahead of ourselves. The reason we need reform has been well articulated previously and in this debate. It also emanates from the fact that many believe the Seanad is not representative of them because of its elitist electorate, which is a fair observation to make for those in the communities we all live in and who recognise that. At the same time, however, they fail to make a distinction between our role as Seanadóirí and that of Teachtaí Dála. Therein lies part of our difficulty in how we see ourselves and how we are defined under the Constitution. At the risk of causing a note of discord, perhaps the framers of the Constitution did not necessarily get the role of the Seanad correct at its inception and in how we see ourselves now and how we operate today. Undoubtedly, the powers and functions of Members of this House can and should be reformed and they have been in some way over the years, but the fundamental difficulty for many Members in the House rests in the franchise, in terms of the changing of the franchise, who can vote and how they vote. That will pose a difficulty. As Senator Martin Conway said, that will pose a challenge on Committee Stage. To be fair to Senator Billy Lawless who represents the diaspora as well as being here as an authentic, able parliamentarian in his own right, how does one extend that franchise and who does one allow to vote? As Senator Paddy Burke asked, how does one put that structure in place? What is important is that we will not be opposing Second Stage and we all want reform, or at least I want reform, about which I will be honest. The Taoiseach, in this House and since the referendum, has been clear on his support for and belief in reform. He has endorsed the Manning report and its implementation. That is Government policy and it is in the programme for Government. It would be remiss of us all, either as part of the implementation group, whoever its members may be, or as Members of this House, not to recognise that there are grave concerns about the Bill. Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill posed a good question. When we talk about the political system, we have not seen significant reform of the Dáil. As a Member of the previous Dáil, I was privileged to be Chairman of a committee which parsed, investigated and analysed much legislation, conducted pre-legislative scrutiny and held committee hearings on the protection of life during pregnancy legislation. We have seen copious volumes of reports on reform of local government, some of which have worked, but what we have seen in local government has been an erosion of the powers given to local authority members, which is not good. Like Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill, I share the view that local government is the closest form of government to the people, and we need to give more powers back to councillors. What will reform of this House look like in its final state? That question is why I would like to move to Committee Stage where we can have a constructive debate on the parts of the Bill which is fundamentally a good idea but is perhaps flawed at one level and I do not mean to be critical when I say that. To be fair to Senator Michael McDowell, we needed someone to take the ball and run with it. If we had not had that, we would be back to talking about implementation, going back to the 12 other reports on Seanad reform, and we would certainly not have the roadmap from the Manning report and this Bill today. Mr. John Downing, in a fine piece in the Irish Independent, wrote correctly that the shelves are groaning with voluminous reports. That is why it is important the Bill proceed to Committee Stage and that we have the implementation group put together by the Taoiseach. If we are to discuss widening the franchise, what will that mean in real terms? Who will be here and how will people vote to get representation in the Upper House? The one part we have not focused on and which I look forward to discussing on Committee Stage or in whatever guise we come back to this issue is the logistics of what reform means in terms of costs, staffing and how we can beef up the House. Fundamentally, we all demand that we scrutinise legislation and that, as I stated when the Taoiseach was here, we bring this House beyond the gates of this complex to the people. That means we should be open to doing different things. I note we have a Seanad consultative committee, chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, which I hope will take up different projects or different aspects of civic life and make positive contributions to them. Senator James Reilly stated his belief that we will have a serious issue around how we can have representation without residency or taxation, something referred to as well by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. We are in favour of reform. Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill spoke about sitting for four days. I wish him luck with that because I do not think he will get Members to come in for four days when they are already involved in constituency work and are doing other work around legislation. Senator Kevin Humphreys's point about climate change is one we should pursue. The value of local authority members is something we should continue to cherish. They have been treated badly and I do not say that as a representative of councillors. We have seen electoral areas increased, their pay reduced and their workload increased. The abolition of the dual mandate has not done what it was meant to do. It has not worked for the betterment of the people. The Bill is one we should support in moving to the next Stage. It is important that from there on we put together that roadmap and go back to the plan, the grand design, and see how we can build up the House. I thank Senator Michael McDowell for his work and commitment. Only for him, we would not be having this debate.

I thank Senator Michael McDowell for putting it forward as it provides us with an opportunity to debate Seanad reform which is absolutely necessary. The Seanad is the Upper House of the Oireachtas, but one would not think it is. Reform should include getting more media coverage for the Seanad. It should also include making the Seanad more valid. Much of the debate is about how Senators are elected. Senators are treated like second-class citizens in the House. I do not want to go back over the GAA ticket matter which was raised earlier by Senator Paddy Burke, but it is an issue. For example, Tuesday was budget day and all Deputies were given tickets for the Visitors Gallery for visitors to hear the Budget Statement. Senators, however, were not afforded the same luxury. That is ridiculous in the Houses of the Oireachtas as all Members are equal. One House is as important as the other. The budget is for everyone, not just for Deputies. The allocation of visitor tickets was unfair and not right. No Senator was on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. We had to fight to get on it which, again, was not right. Those are three small examples of how the Seanad is treated with which I do not agree. Much of today's and previous debates has centred on how the Seanad is elected. This should be dealt with on a broader basis. I do not agree with taking the vote away from councillors, as has been suggested. While there is talk about Seanad and local authority reform, there is never any talk about Dáil reform. Local authority reform reduced the number of councillors and abolished town councils. Deputies made that decision and councillors had no say in the matter. That is not right as councillors work on the ground and deal with constituents every day. Without them, we would not function as a state. One cannot just reform the local authorities and the Seanad without doing anything about the Dáil. I believe in extending the Seanad franchise to the diaspora and giving it a say. When I was an emigrant in London for four years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I always came home to vote. Apart from the fact my father would have killed me if I did not, I felt passionately about politics back then in my late teens and early 20s. As every emigrant cannot do that, there must be a way of extending the vote to the diaspora. However, it has to be carefully examined. If one looks at the electoral register, it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. If we cannot get the register right for general or local elections, how can we get it right if we extend the vote to the diaspora across the world? I also do not agree with online voting as this would open the doors to allow people to fiddle with the register. It was argued that only people who pay tax should get the vote. That is not necessarily right either but that would be important for the committee to examine. For the purposes of Seanad elections, the country should be divided into regions. I enjoyed and had a great time on the recent Seanad campaign, which one is not supposed to admit. I saw places I had never seen before from the Inishowen Peninsula all the way down to Cork. However, as a politician, I might not necessarily be relevant to someone on the Inishowen Peninsula. The Seanad electoral base should be divided into regions to allow Senators to represent one region, canvass it and get to know its issues. I agree with most of what Senators Paul Daly and Michelle Mulherin said. I support the Bill's sentiment and acknowledge the work Senator Michael McDowell has put into it. I support its passage to Committee Stage because some amendments need to be made to it.

That is the Bill I am presenting. While it is nice to hear Members compliment me for all the hard work I put into it, and although I did assist the Manning committee on the broader issues, I cannot claim credit for the actual drafting of the Bill itself. I pay tribute to those who were part of that process and who put much work into it. I am a little perplexed by the Leader's approach to this and the suggestion made earlier that we are putting the cart before the horse. I do not see that at all. There are many procedures in this House which can be changed. This House is the total master of its own procedures. It is not the total master of the resources necessary to give effect to the changes we make, however. Under the Constitution, each House of the Oireachtas is totally free to decide and change its own procedures. There is no significant constraint on us, apart from the question of resources to implement whatever we actually do. It must be remembered that there are inside and outside electoral panels for the Seanad. The Oireachtas Members panel, the inside one, has a designated guaranteed minimum under the present system. The Bill aims to get rid of that. Deputies and Senators would not have, and need not have, a guaranteed input into who gets into the Seanad. Accordingly, if we do change it to bring in a popular franchise of, say, 30 versus 13 in respect of the 43 panels, as suggested by the Manning committee, we can strengthen the rights of councillors by eliminating the right of the Dáil and the Seanad to grab a specified portion of the seats on each panel for themselves. This would decomplicate the local authority-Oireachtas Members elections in that way. Article 9.3 of the Constitution, an often forgotten article, states, "Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens". If one holds an Irish passport, it is an indication of citizenship and one owes a duty of loyalty to the State. The fact one might belong to a greater diaspora in the numbers mentioned by Senator Billy Lawless and be one of 40 million people does not mean one is a citizen or owes the State a duty of loyalty. If one does owe the State a duty of loyalty, the very least the State can do is recognise and reciprocate that duty. Accordingly, wherever one is in the world, if one owes that duty of loyalty to the State, there is no reason the State should not care about what one thinks when we compose the Legislature. The issue of taxation and representation is very well made as an argument. Under the Constitution, apart from making recommendations on finance legislation and money Bills, this House has virtually no competence in taxation matters.That is part of the democratic process and part of what the people voted for in 1937. We have different functions, but that is not one of ours. There is elaborate machinery in the Constitution to ensure the views of the Dáil on matters financial are absolutely paramount and that, at best, we are given the right to make a passing comment as it does what it does.

The amendment in 1979 was passed by 92% of people. They did not stipulate that there must be a single constituency, as provided for in the Bill and as proposed by the Government. They said we could divide up the seats differently. Senator David Norris might be interested to know that it is perfectly legitimate under the Constitution to hold that Trinity College Dublin would have a seat no matter what, or that NUI would have a seat, etc. That is something which can be dealt with. The issues raised by Senator David Norris can be discussed on Committee Stage. This is not a black and white or binary matter whereby everyone is in one constituency and no existing elements of the third level sector can be somehow protected.

It is not suggested there be online voting. It is suggested that part of the process be changed. As Senator David Norris will appreciate, the process is rather cumbersome at the moment for the universities. Registered letters go out and get left in post offices. Then people have to go chasing the registered letters. That procedure could be gotten rid of by allowing people to download their voting paper. However, these would have to be validated by a unique personal number to avail of that system. Let us remember this: Senator David Norris and I have one thing in common.

The NUI register has 113,000 people on it. The figure is extraordinary. Of that total, between 35,000 and 40,000 actually vote. The rest are lost somewhere in the diaspora. The point is that it is entirely possible to afford people a postal vote and to have a postal system without extensive electoral fraud. I do not believe there was ever extensive electoral fraud in a university election. Therefore, I do not believe there is any practical problem in providing a postal vote along the lines suggested by the Manning committee. I mention it because some Members of the House are afraid of what would happen if people in Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens and who owe a duty of loyalty to the State assert their Irish citizenship. If we give them the vote, it does not mean the barbarian hordes are going to be at the gates or will change the entire system in the country or in this House, for that matter. The basis of the Bill is the notion that candidates have to go and look for the votes to start with.

God only knows what they would be on the eighth amendment and so on. I am simply making the point. A number of Members of the House have it in the back of their minds that Sinn Féin will somehow undertake a vast vote-rigging operation in places on this planet where no one can see what is happening. That is not going to happen. It does not happen in the universities or anywhere else. Therefore, I do not see that there is a real problem. The Taoiseach came before the House and said he was in favour of an implementation group. The Leader asked what happened to it. The Leader may be asking me what happened to it but I do not know. He is the Taoiseach's spokesman in this House. I would like to see that implementation group set up. If the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage let us be clear about one thing: it is going to go through that process. It is not going to go into some kind of backwater to be left there unconsidered while we think of some other reason nothing should be done. I made this point the other day when the Taoiseach was here. It may well be that the establishment of all the registers and the enrolment of all the potential voters will take a period of time, inevitably. If we pass legislation in the life of this Seanad and Dáil, it may well be that we will have to provide, by amendment to the Bill, that the next election be conducted under the old system because there will not have been enough time to find out what Irish passport holders in Australia are all about. Those who fear for their lives here should consider the possibility that this will take time to implement. That does not make me any the less enthusiastic about it, but it does not mean that those who have been elected under the present system are necessarily going to see a radically new system next time an election takes place, especially given the reasonably pessimistic views about the longevity of this Dáil and Seanad. I thank the House for its indulgence. I call on the House to pass the Bill to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage, where all of the issues, including the issues raised by Senator David Norris, the issues about the diaspora, postal voting and whether there should be more or fewer council dominated seats in the Seanad can be considered. Those issues can be discussed at that Stage honestly and decently among people. We should no longer hide ourselves behind the complexity of the issue and use that as the reason for doing nothing. It is complex, but that is all the more reason it should be addressed as quickly as possible.

Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire. Tuigim go bhfuil cúrsaí gnóthach go maith na laethanta seo agus aimsir an bhuiséid agus mar sin de orainn. In the time since this Bill was first before the Dáil we have had a report from the Simon Communities of Ireland confirming that the problems in the private rented sector continue. The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, now has a total of 323,271 tenancies registered, representing 172,121 landlords and 704,332 occupants. We are introducing the Bill to help Fianna Fáil fulfil a promise made in its manifesto to introduce rent controls. Under the heading, strengthening tenant rights and implementing rent certainty measures, its An Ireland for All manifesto stated:Spiralling rent prices are driving families out of their homes, pricing young workers out of cities and alienating potential future investment in the city. We need to introduce measures to cool down the market and curb excessive rent rises. Tenants need enhanced security to ensure stability in their home. We will implement current rent certainty measures.As Fianna Fáil included it in its policy which it brought to the people, I hope it will support this Bill. If it does not, the public is entitled to ask when it will be in a position to support it. Mar sin, iarraim ar Sheanadóirí Fhianna Fáil a bheith linn inniu agus tacú a thabhairt don mBille. Rent certainty should have been provided for in yesterday’s Budget Statement. Every week this Bill is held up, it costs families €1,000 extra a year. Any support of the amendment which is a kick-to-touch device will end up costing families substantially. Those Members who vote against the Bill will have to explain their actions - more precisely their lack of actions - to the people. The Bill seeks to link rent increases with the consumer price index. In simple terms, this means rents should not increase more than the cost of living rises. There is criticism from some quarters that the consumer price index is not the best indicator with which to measure rent increases. They quote from the Central Statistics Office that it is not a suitable measure of the rise in the cost of living. If Seanadóirí hold this view, I ask them to support the substantive aim of the Bill, allow it to pass to Committee Stage and then propose amendments and suggest other more suitable indices. This is not a panacea for the overall housing problem. The private rental sector is deeply flawed and will require much legislation to fix, as well as action by all stakeholders to reform it into a sustainable model. Supply will remain a constant problem as there is a lack of units being built, a large number of tenants in private rental accommodation who should be elsewhere and a significant number of vacant units. For example, in Dublin there are over 40,000 vacant units. These are not social housing units but private properties which have fallen into disrepair with the owner unable to carry out work on the property or sitting tight, refusing to do anything with it. This is not ideal but in a housing crisis, it is lunacy to allow this to continue. Sinn Féin welcomes the initial steps announced yesterday to begin a scheme to provide rent payments upfront to renovate these vacant properties for rental. Rent certainty provides certainty for landlord and tenant alike. We are experiencing a continued rise in rents across the State. Rents were up 3.9% in the last quarter, the largest three-month rise since 2007. In 2007 there was a massive decline in rents which would also be avoided with the passage of this legislation. Many of the arguments against rent certainty claim the crisis has not reached such a level that legislation is required. The question is, when will it be a crisis for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael? A recent report by the Simon Communities of Ireland called for exactly what is contained in the Bill to be implemented. It highlighted how inadequate the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rent supplement were when there was a lack of available houses to rent under these schemes. When available properties were surveyed in Galway city for the report, there was an average of 12 available, a decrease of 21 properties, since the last survey was carried out in May 2016. Out of these 12 properties, none was within the HAP-rent supplement limits for a single person or a couple. There was one such property available in May. In the time since the Bill was voted down in the Dáil, the situation has become worse. It is not a problem which will be solved with the passage of time. Accordingly, I do not want to hear excuses from Fianna Fáil claiming it is too early for such legislation or we should wait for endless reports, consultations and studies before moving on the issue. Back in February 2016, the Fianna Fáil Seanad leader, Senator Catherine Ardagh, then a councillor, raised this specific issue when she pointed out the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, had taken 10,000 homes out of the private housing market in 2015 alone. Her statement continued:To put this into perspective, there were fewer than 10,000 new homes constructed ... The only new homes made available to the market under the Minister’s strategy are the paltry 28 new social houses.She then decried the issues in the private rental market, saying something needed to be done. The Government with its Fianna Fáil partners are the experts at kicking to touch. Water charges were kicked to touch, with bin charges being suspended for a period. Legislation for banded hours contracts can be supported in nine months’ time. All of this has nothing to do with waiting for the optimal time for these to have effect. The average rent for a one-bedroom property was 42% more than the rental accommodation scheme-HAP limits for a single person. Sometimes these figures can hide the reality, which is that a single person would need almost one and half times the payments available to him or her to pay rent for one month. This is a stark sign that the current system is not sustainable. One factor which exacerbates this problem is that many of the private rental properties in Galway and other areas with third level institutions are being rented to students. This is due to the lack of adequate student accommodation. In many cases the private rental sector is completely unsuitable for students and places pressure on parents. Many parents have had to take out loans or even use credit cards to provide third level accommodation for their children. The building of social housing is necessary, not only in terms of investment in our future but also in playing a direct role in easing the crisis in the private rental sector.Social housing tenants are in private rental properties and this is one of the causes of the market being flooded. If there was adequate social housing, just as if there was adequate student housing, it would free up thousands of private rental properties. The budgetary housing measures announced yesterday were nothing more than a sop to the construction industry. Since the first-time buyer scheme was mooted several months ago, house prices across the State have risen by 2.9%. It is not difficult to discern a pattern whereby developers simply factor in the cost of any scheme into the overall cost. Our Bill is common-sense. It is common-sense to provide certainty for all parties in the market. Where the Government failed to use the budget to positively impact on the thousands of households who rent from month to month, uncertain of their future, Sinn Féin has put forward a positive proposal. I am constantly hearing the question from our oppoents and colleagues in Fianna Fáil about where our positive proposals are. Here is a positive proposal that we are asking the House to support. The Committee on Housing and Homelessness, as well as many other charities and NGOs, have called for precisely this measure on many occasions. Accepting the Bill would let them know that they are finally being listened to. Nuair a tháinig foireann Shinn Féin le chéile ag tús an téarma Oireachtais seo, bhí muid uilig ar aon intinn go gcaithfí dul i ngleic le géarchéim na tithíochta ar bhonn uilepháirtí. Cosúil le mórán daoine eile, labhair mé leis na mílte duine le linn an fheachtais olltoghchánaíochta agus ba léir dom go raibh an fhadhb seo fós ag dul in olcas. Ardú meanma a bhí ann chuile dhuine ó na páirtithe uilig a fheiceáil ag obair as lámh a chéile chun teacht ar chomhréiteach ar an gcomhchoiste tithíochta. Ach ní leor an comhoibriú féin. Caithfear beart a dhéanamh de réir briathar agus tacú le reachtaíocht a thabharfas éifeacht don dea-thoil a tháinig amach as béil Fhianna Fáil gan stad roimh an toghchán. Tá dul chun cinn ag teastáil ó na daoine atá i gceist leis an mBille seo. Mar sin, iarraim ar Sheanadóirí gan bheith mar iománaithe ar an gclaí. Iarraim orthu a bheith linn ar an bpáirc ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an bhfadhb. Let us consider the issues on a more local basis. Organisations throughout the country are doing great work to support people who are in difficult situations of homelessness. Many of them cite issues in the private rental sector as having an impact on other issues. It is stark to read the annual report of COPE Galway, an organisation that does fantastic work to help people. The annual report from 2015 states the organisation worked with 659 households and that 369 children were affected by homelessness in Galway. The figures include 166 families, 493 single people and seven couples. Those involved tell us the most significant issue is a lack of housing. The impacts of this on the COPE Galway domestic violence services are severe. In 2015 the organisation worked with 380 women and their 180 children who were experiencing domestic violence. COPE Galway provided 780 outreach appointments, 205 court accompaniments and answered 1,100 crisis calls. However, the organisation was unable to accommodate 288 women and 405 children who requested refuge due to a lack of space. I believe this is part of the knock-on effect of the issues in the private rental sector. COPE Galway also does wonderful work with older people and provides older people's services. There is a section in the COPE Galway annual report on the increasing incidence of family homelessness. There may have been a belief up to some years ago that homelessness only affected people who were down and out. COPE Galway tells us that a total of 56 families, comprising 36 lone-parent families, as well as 20 non-lone-parent families, including 133 children, were provided with emergency accommodation in 2015. This represented a 107% increase on the figure for the previous year, when 27 families, all lone-parent families, including 55 children, were provided with emergency accommodation. COPE Galway has stated the loss of private rented housing was the reason these families became homeless, with most experiencing homelessness for the first time. Many first came into contact with COPE Galway homeless services at the point they had been issued with a notice to quit by their landlord. The planned sale of the property was most often the stated reason. Anecdotally, we know that the notice-to-quit methodology being used by many landlords is actually simply a mechanism to increase rents. That is another reason I am putting forward the case that we need to introduce rent certainty. I am disappointed that the Government has put forward an amendment. I call on the Government Members to retract the amendment at this stage. I appeal to colleagues across the House to do the right thing on rent certainty. It is actually the right thing for the landlords and tenants. It gives far more certainty. It is a simple act. I hope Members will support the Sinn Féin Bill.

#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	147	My colleague, Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, has gone into the detail of the Bill and the reasons for it. I am keen to discuss it in the context of the politics we have. I was struck by a phrase in the Dáil yesterday echoed by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies. The phrase was that the centre must hold. This has been the subject of considerable comment through the course of the past 24 hours. It got me thinking. What do we mean when we talk about the centre? What do we mean by the centre of politics? I take it to mean reasonable moderate inclusive politics. It strikes me that there was little of any of that in yesterday's Budget Statement. The budget has been described by Fr. Peter McVerry as a landlord's charter. I imagine everyone in the Chamber would respect the views of a man such as Fr. Peter McVerry. When it comes to housing and homelessness he is recognised as an expert. There is something rather strange about the State. Let us consider how rents and housing are organised throughout most of mainstream western Europe. We find that having rules for rents is the norm, as is having rules around rent certainty. Having rental properties that are not subject to the extremes of boom and bust is the norm. The reason for this is because it is a regulated sector in these countries. The political consensus in the centre has it that this is something we do to protect people. It is strange that there has never been this consensus of the centre in this state. It is strange that parties which claim to be of the centre have always, regrettably, taken the side of landlords in this state. It is a poor reflection on parties that claim to be of the centre. Whenever anything is challenged in terms of the status of landowners, they always fall by the wayside and allow the status quo to continue. Why should we not have rent certainty? Why are the people of this country not entitled to rent certainty? Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael claim to be parties of the centre, but when it comes to crunch issues like challenging the status quo in respect of property, they constantly disappear or sneak away. Why is that? Having read the Government amendment to the Bill, there are no surprises for me. Those on the Government side are suggesting we kick the can down the road and not deal with this issue today, but that we might look at it again in a few months' time. That seems to be the over-riding mantra of the Government on any issue of substance. The view is that we should not deal with it today or take a decision that would be in the interests of all the people, because that might hurt some of the people they like to protect. It is no coincidence that the people who produced the budget yesterday with absolutely no measures to redistribute wealth from those who have it to those who have not are the same people who are going to sit in the Chamber today and essentially make the case that it is a nice idea and they like it - in fact, in the case of Fianna Fáil, it is in the party manifesto - but they have no wish to deal with it now. I appeal, in particular, to our colleagues in Fianna Fáil.I recognise that some good points have been made about housing, particularly by Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor in recent months. I appeal to Fianna Fáil to take a second look at the Bill and think of the people in their own areas, those who have had rent hikes of €300 and €400 a time, those who are crying out for some kind of decent regulation and find that Government after Government has turned a blind eye to it. I ask them to think about it. To be clear, if they do not support this moderate reasonable Bill today, the message will go out that Fianna Fáil has once again rejected rent certainty and I would have to believe at least some Members on the Fianna Fáil side cannot be comfortable with that notion. We had a wonderful moment last week in the Dáil where we got behind a Bill that had all the right sentiments regarding the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA. In fairness, we saw the Fianna Fáil Party listen on that occasion, it abstained and we managed to send a strong message on the CETA. I am asking our colleagues in Fianna Fáil to look again today at providing for rent certainty. It is an issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people in the State. We know that because the fact is that rent hikes have been absolutely outrageous. It is not only a Dublin issue. We know that rents in Dublin are astronomical, but where I live, in Limerick, colleagues of mine are facing rent hikes of €300 and €400 when they come up for review. The bottom line is this. We can either do something about it - that is what the Bill has been designed to do - or we can blow hot air and say, "If only", or "We agree with you but", and effectively do nothing. I ask a simple question. Is that the best that the people deserve? Is that the best this Chamber can do? Last week we showed that we could do better. This week, I believe, with genuine goodwill on all sides, we should be able to do better than that. If it cannot do better, the message will go out loud and clear that Fianna Fáil has backed the Government in refusing rent certainty. On the back of a day yesterday when, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil was at one with Fine Gael, it will do Fianna Fáil no good to find itself in the same corner again. As I say, I am aware there are genuine concerns on the Fianna Fáil benches about this issue. Its Members should have the courage to stand up and do what is right, not for us - I would not expect that - but for those in rented accommodation. We can talk about it, we can ramble on about it or we can take the opportunity in this Chamber to do something. We can make the Seanad relevant again, as it was last week. We have choices, let us make the right decisions.

I recognise it is an effort to improve the circumstances in the entire rental sector in sustaining tenancies. However, if we analyse it and break it down in terms of what it would mean if it was implemented in the morning, we must look at the possible consequences of enacting such legislation. We all are agreed that there is no silver bullet to resolve the housing crisis. It is a crisis for many reasons, but, essentially, it is about the lack of supply. The fundamental underlying reason is we do not have enough houses to meet current demand. That is the result of a legacy of, as some Senators have said, a boom-bust cycle, but it also means that we have a dysfunctional property and construction sector and a dysfunctional rental sector. Until we address these underlying issues of supply, unfortunately, we will not see the full resolution to which we all aspire. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government
has displayed that the highest priority for the Government is to provide adequate housing to meet citizens' needs. That is displayed, not only in words but also in the provision of funding, in policy interventions, legislation and many more interventions that the Minister will outline later. It all goes back to supply which has to be addressed if the challenges are to be met in increasing supply for private purchases, increasing supply for local authorities and the approved housing bodies in the voluntary sector and increasing supply for the rental sector. The recent Government action plan for housing and homelessness is a proactive tangible response to meet all of these needs that are outlined under five pillars - addressing homelessness, accelerating social housing, building more homes, improving the rental sector and utilising existing housing stock. It behoves all of us because it has become a crisis of such proportions that it is beyond politics in my eyes. I believe the Minister and the Government should be supported in trying to implement the Rebuilding Ireland plan. We will need not only the policy makers to support the plan. We are depending also on the local authorities, including members and officials. We are depending on the voluntary sector and the approved housing bodies to help us to achieve the challenging objectives and targets that have been set. We are also depending on the construction sector that has been the sector hit most in the economic recession in the past few years. Everybody can see the legacy that is carried by the construction sector. By extension, the rental sector is also affected because the supply numbers are simply not available for a normal functioning rental market. That is why Government has proposed an amendment to the Sinn Féin Second Stage motion on the Rent Certainty (No. 2) Bill 2016. We believe the Bill is premature for the reasons outlined, but we also firmly believe we need to be careful with regard to policy interventions that could provide disincentives to landlords or drive more of them out of the market at this critical time. The proposal is link rent with the consumer price index, CPI. There is a significant risk - this has been backed up by independent reports - that CPI-linked rents would, in fact, discourage new investors from entering the market and that is something we simply cannot afford. Recent statistics show that new registrations of tenancies in 2013 stood at 114,000 and that in 2015 there was a dip to 105,000 registrations. That clearly shows that there is a supply challenge in the entire rental sector and to make policy interventions such as proposed without thinking through their consequences could have a severe impact. The proposal might be well meaning but it could, in fact, have a negative impact on the availability of properties for rent if it is not sustainable. I do not hold a candle to landlords and if one looks at the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, one will see a number of interventions were made that the landlord sector opposed and with which it was not happy. They were positive interventions to try to sustain tenancies in this critical period until we get the construction sector back to a functioning normal mode and increase the supply of housing. While it is well meaning, we need to be careful and cautious about the Bill. If it had even some type of sunset clause over a period of two or three years, it might have allayed some fears, but the figures show that landlords, many of whom are accidental landlords, are getting out of the market and that properties are being sold, which means that they are not available for rental any longer. That is a problem of which we need to be acutely aware in any intervention we make. Going back to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, it is fair to say the Government made interventions at the time to try to sustain tenancies in rental accommodation such as increasing the minimum period between rent reviews from 12 to 24 months. That is to operate for a period of four years - this critical period until we get the construction sector repaired and the supply side back up. Another measure was increasing the minimum period of notice for a new rent increase from 28 to 90 days, which was to help in providing for sustainability. Landlords, as the House will be aware, are precluded from increasing rents above the market rate. If there is evidence that they are increasing them above and beyond that rate, tenants have recourse to appeal to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which will adjudicate on such matters and rents will remain at the current level until the adjudication happens.It is important to note that there are many supports available. It is recognised that there are still challenges, but that is why, across parties, we need to support the Minister and the Government in driving the delivery of housing units across all sectors. The Government is committing over €5.3 billion to deliver over 47,000 units by 2021. This is ambitious and challenging, but it is not something we cannot achieve if we align all of our forces at local, regional and national level in terms of policy-makers and the construction and rental sectors. As stated, we have a lot of accidental landlords who, owing to legacies of times past, are under huge debt pressures and must sustain their properties and recoup a sustainable income through rent. If we are going to limit it, we could drive them out of the sector. I know that the Government and the Minister want to see more long-term lettings and sustainability in rents. The budget measures will certainly help in that regard. I know that sometimes they do not go as far as many would like, but the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers will assist in increasing levels of supply because it is an incentive for such buyers to purchase new units rather than existing ones. There is also tax relief for landlords to try to keep them in the market in order that they will not exit in circumstances where there are fewer properties available to rent. The increase in the rent-a-room income ceiling to €14,000 is another measure that can certainly help to alleviate some of the pressures. In many of the pressure areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other places people have spare capacity in their houses and this might incentivise them to let surplus rooms to persons in need or students who require accommodation. The HAP scheme, in respect of which €105 million is being allocated, has proved successful in areas where it is up and running. I know that there were issues with ceilings and the scheme not being available in all local authority areas, but much progress has been made with it. I can say without contradiction that we would be in a far worse position in terms of the housing crisis were it not for the HAP scheme which has met the needs of many thousands throughout the country. I wish the Minister well with the Rebuilding Ireland programme. I fully support it and believe it is a tangible strategy that sets out a vision with funding behind it. If we can get behind the programme and address the issues on the supply side, we will, in turn, resolve many of difficulties in the rental sector.
#JenniferMurnaneOConnor	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-party	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-dob	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	150	Fianna Fáil will not be supporting the Bill. The introduction of this highly flawed legislation undermines attempts to provide real solutions to the housing crisis. As a party, we are on record in calling for stronger rent certainty measures and did so long before Sinn Féin. However, our measures were well thought out. Fianna Fáil published a policy document, Generation Rent - A new deal for Renters and Landlords, which aimed to stabilise rents immediately by restricting rents to an area-based rental index both within and between tenancies. This is similar to the model in operation in many German cities. This proposal would be for a maximum of three years pending annual reviews of the effects of the regulation of market supply. By contrast, Sinn Féin's introduction of this half-page Bill which attempts to make highly flawed changes to a hugely complex area, represents political posturing of the most careless and irresponsible kind. The Bill is extremely defective. First, if passed, there is a strong likelihood that it would lead to short-term spikes in rents, as well as an increase in tenancy turnover. This is what happened for two months prior to the introduction of the former Minister's rent regulations in January 2016. Second, while watered down, the recently introduced rent certainty measures have only just taken effect and it would be highly irresponsible to introduce new regulations which would lead to more disruption and upheaval in the market, prior to reviewing the effects of the current rent certainty measures. Third, the Sinn Féin proposal to link rent increases and decreases with a measure of inflation through the consumer price index, CPI, is flawed. A report in 2014 commissioned by the PRTB found that had market rents been linked with the CPI during the period from 2000 to 2014, they would be far higher than they are. I look forward to publication of the report on rent certainty and affordability which is being prepared by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and due before Christmas because it will play a crucial role in dealing with the issue of rents. The measures included in the Bill before the House, the main provision of which aims to link rent increases or decreases with the CPI's inflation index, are highly defective. The new rent certainty measures only commenced in January 2016. At the very least, they should be given some time to bed down. Their effect on rent levels, units and supply will be reviewed prior to the introduction of the new regulations. While it is currently illegal for landlords to end tenants' leases mid-contract, they can end existing tenancies if they want to sell their properties or if they want family members to use them. This is a problem because a landlord can end a tenancy any time he or she wants. This issue needs to be examined. The continued shortfall in supply and increasing demand has put significant upward pressure on rents. Rental market increases are, in the main, a result of the legacy of under-supply in recent years. It is estimated that just 9,000 housing units were completed in 2014 compared with an estimated requirement of 25,000. The number of units completed in 2011 and 2013 was even smaller. The false notion that vacant homes and ghost estates somewhere in the midlands are a substitute for vacant homes where they are actually needed still lingers. We are still not building houses - even in the midlands. All of this needs to be addressed. Far from keeping rents down, freezing rents in the manner proposed could encourage landlords to raise rents up sharply at the beginning and the end of tenancies, which would create a problem. Restricting prices to below market levels would only make supply even more scarce. Fianna Fáil's proposal will encourage long-term leasing to give tenants greater security in their occupancies and allow families to consider renting as a long-term option. These changes will also alter the balance of power in favour of tenants who would still be able to terminate their contracts after their probationary period with one month's notice. It is crucial that this issue be addressed. This proposal would be far more effective in stabilising rents than the measure proposed by Sinn Féin and inflict less damage to the rental market. The private rental sector faces a crisis in supply and providing security. This has driven up costs and undermined the sector. Action is urgently required. Combining it with boosting supply is key. We will introduce a series of measures to provide security for renters. We also propose to introduce a family tenant lease to facilitate long-term renting above the current four-year cycle, to improve the quality of accommodation by means of a new certification scheme - to be operated by local authorities and approved by the PRTB - in order to improve tenants' rights and review the current rent certainty scheme in the coming years I will not support the Bill before the House. As the Minister is aware, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. I know that he has a plan to build 47,000 houses. It is crucial that this plan be implemented as soon as possible in order that those on local authority housing lists can be housed and others can qualify for inclusion in the housing list. The cap is a massive issue for me. In my local authority area the cap is €27,500. My biggest problem is that most people do not qualify for inclusion in the local authority housing list, which is causing another form of homelessness. Renting is crucial. The HAP scheme needs to be addressed. We must also ensure rental units in the midlands or elsewhere assist people who do not qualify for the local authority housing list because, as the Minister is aware, the new HAP scheme only applies to persons on the housing list. There are others who fall through the cracks because they do not qualify for inclusion in the housing list, but they need rent allowance. I ask the Minister to ensure this is also kept in place.

I do not want to engage in using over the top language about it, but it suffers from having a number of flaws.One has to consider the dynamics of the society and the provision of housing. Would the introduction of this Bill bring us to a stage where more money was available to create a viable thriving and competitive rental sector or would it drive away investment in rented accommodation? The answer is fairly obvious. The long-term effect, even the medium-term and, for reasons that have been mentioned in speeches, the short-term effects would be counterproductive. The Bill would not achieve what Sinn Féin hopes for in proposing it. It would, in fact, drive money out of the provision of rental accommodation, make people unwilling to enter into that market and tend to drive rents up if people had an opportunity to increase them. This would be because they would know that if this was the law for the long term, they would have to provide for future changes in housing market prices to cushion themselves against being landlords of properties which were let at an amount far below the market rate for rents in the area. This is a misguided Bill. We forget that whenever one comes into a malfunctioning market which is exploiting tenants and one decides to operate with a legislative scalpel on that market, a few hard questions have to be asked. Two or three years ago a friend was thinking of buying property in Dublin and thought I was a good person to look at houses with him from an architectural point of view and to judge their soundness as someone who was interested in it. I went to quite a few properties in relatively well-to-do parts of Rathmines, Ranelagh and all those kind of places which seemed at that stage to be going for attractive prices. As I walked around, I realised going from one room to another that they were bedsits which had been cleared out. I could see the traces of the cookers and whatever else and the fairly downmarket adaptations of the rooms for bedsit letting. I became more and more depressed at the thought that somebody in Dublin City Council, I think, had decided that bedsit accommodation was to be outlawed and made it unlawful to continue to rent out accommodation in which kitchen or bathroom accommodation was shared or where the apartment was not fully self-contained. I do not know how many separate dwellings were ruled to be illegal in this city, but I think it was of the order of 10,000. They were, generally, for people who were not well to do, often single, many of them elderly and this was the best they could afford. Did whoever it was on the quays who decided at the stroke of a pen to improve housing standards in the city of Dublin think for one minute about the social and market consequences of scrapping that accommodation without working out whether there was a functioning rental market to which the people who were going to be evicted could have resort? It struck me that they did not, although it was well intentioned. Everybody would like to have a top quality rented sector available, but the person concerned did not ask what would happen to the woman or man in her or his 50s who had been in this place for 15, 20 or 30 years when the new law came into effect. Does Sinn Féin really believe this will increase the provision of decent rental accommodation or drive people out of that market? I believe the Bill would have that effect. One of the consequences of the decision on bedsits is that people now share houses, including the bathroom. They do not have a separate letting of each room, except by internal arrangements among themselves. They may not even have fully functional Yale locks on their doors, but their position is similar in many respects to the bedsit arrangement that was declared unlawful. It is the same thing by another name. The consequence was that between 8,000 and 12,000 people were put out of their homes because somebody thought to improve the quality of rental accommodation in Dublin at the stroke of a bureaucratic pen. I should declare an interest because I have let a property in the past. The Bill is well intentioned. It has been designed to stop people being ripped off in a rising market where there is low supply, but it would not in the long term increase the supply. It is contradictory to its aim to bring fairness to people who are vulnerable and need to be protected. We need to accelerate the investment in providing rental accommodation and take steps of which even the Minister’s strategy may not have thought. I think sometimes that Dublin City Council should operate on a "use it or lose it" basis in respect of land in the city which has a high value but is being left derelict for this or that reason and do what the Wide Streets Commissioners did 200 years ago, which is to acquire it and give it to somebody on a building lease and say rental accommodation should be built now. We need dynamism in the provision of rental accommodation. Every day coming here I pass Charlemont Street, where Dublin City Council is rebuilding the Tom Kelly flats complex. It was sad to see that a large portion of the site was lying empty for approximately two years while Dublin City Council, which owned the property, got its act together. Local authorities are not the most dynamic. They are slow in turning projects around. There should be methods to encourage others into developing available space. There is nothing unconstitutional about having a use it or lose it provision for unused property which has the potential for residential use and give people whatever value the site has. It should be handed over to somebody who will provide rental accommodation. I hope the Sinn Féin Members do not think I am being unduly negative, but I believe this is a recipe for worsening rather than improving the position.

I believe the proposal to link any increase or decrease in rent, arising from a rent review, with the consumer price index as set by the Central Statistics Office to be modest and sensible that would go some way towards providing stability in a very volatile and often broken housing market. This call for full rent certainty is supported by a range of civil society groups, including the Simon Communities of Ireland. Having worked for the Simon Community in Cork for many years I saw at first hand every day the devastating impact of homelessness on people and their lives. There is no doubt that rising rents are driving people into homelessness. Given the scale of the national housing and homelessness crisis, we all need to move beyond partisan politics and work collectively in the national interest to resolve the crisis.The Government and the Minister's commendable and ambitious Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to creating a sustainable, secure and affordable rental sector. Under the heading of security, the action plan commits to bringing greater certainty to tenants and landlords. There is consensus on this across the floor. The Bill provides for this desired certainty and would go some way to help make the Government commitment a reality. Working together, the Opposition parties, the Government and Independents can resolve these issues. Homelessness is not inevitable. We do not need to wait. We can act today by passing the Bill. Fixing the rental sector is at the core of this response and this was reinforced in yesterday's Budget Statement. Today, therefore, it is all the more important that we urgently take measures to make the market operate as well as possible. People have suffered and continue to suffer the impact of the under-regulated rental market. Although there are Members of this and the other House who fear and loathe market regulation, when the market is as dysfunctional and broken as our is, it requires these modest interventions. Just as one sets rules for young children about the number of sweets they can eat on a Sunday, unstable markets require regulations to operate properly. This includes regulations on quality and standards in people's homes which the previous Senator mentioned. Standards and expectations rightly rise. For the first year of my life, I lived in a house with an outside toilet. Nobody would think it was a reasonable expectation in this day and age. We moved a few doors down and had an inside bathroom. The previous Senator talked about the regulation and improvement in the quality of bedsits. It is only right and proper that these bedsits which people call their homes come up to the standards we now recognise as normal.

The Simon Communities of Ireland report, Locked Out Of The Market V: The Gap between Rent Supplement/HAP Limits and Market Rents, published last week, showed that in the year to the second quarter of 2016, rents had increased by 18.2% in Cork city; 10% in Dublin city centre; 14.6% in County Louth; 13.9% in Galway city; 12.5% in County Kildare; 7.5% in County Leitrim; 15.5% in Limerick city; 12% in County Laois; and 3.8% in Sligo. From this, we can conclude that rising rents are a problem nationwide and that it needs the national response which the Bill encompasses. The housing rental market needs new rules. The proposal in the Bill is not new or revolutionary. It is a form of rent regulation used in countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Germany and France and we should use it in Ireland too. For the thousands of children, families and single people experiencing homelessness in Ireland tonight, I support the Bill.

The Labour Party will support it, although it is very limited in its scope. We recently published our own Bill, the Social and Affordable Housing Bill 2016, which goes far beyond what is in the Bill we are discussing. However, as the provisions of the Bill are encompassed in our Bill, we will support it. Our Bill, published by Deputy Willie Penrose, seeks to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. It provides a proper definition of "landlord" and would prohibit landlords from refusing to allow tenants to stay beyond the sale period of a house. It would also provide that the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, would be the agency that would provide rental guidelines based on the consumer price index, CPI, and geographical guidelines across the country. It would also provide that rents would be reviewed on a 12-monthly basis and that rent issues would be dealt with by the PRTB. It would prevent vacant tenancy as a result of the sale of a house which, as mentioned by Senator Colette Kelleher, is commonplace across Europe. This is one of the few European countries in which the mention of a sale by a landlord can result in a vacant tenancy. Our Bill also seeks to change the role and scope of NAMA and change its name, on a transition day, to the national housing development and finance agency. NAMA which has done a very good job, except in one or two matters, would have a new focus. The focus in our Bill for NAMA would be to address the shortage in supply of houses for sale and rent and to ensure a stable and functioning accommodation market. Our Bill also proposes to change tax laws to assist landlords who cannot write off interest on money borrowed for the development and upgrade of housing against their profits. They should be allowed to do it. As previous speakers said, unless we have people prepared to invest in the market, we do not have a market and have a narrowing of the base of houses. Our Bill also seeks to reduce the VAT rate applied to materials from 13.5% to 9% to allow for materials for the provision, construction, renovation and alteration of houses to be assessed and charged at 9%. We also want to bring forward a vacant site levy to amend the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 to bring forward the levy to 2017. This would further encourage the use of vacant land which, as has been said, is lying idle while thousands wait on housing lists. The Kenny report of 1973 which has lain on the shelves since is adopted in our Bill, with one or two modifications. The issue is constantly being debated as being unconstitutional. In 2004 an all-party Oireachtas committee examined the Kenny report and deemed it to be constitutionally sound. The vacant land across the country would be compulsorily purchased at 125% of its market value. Vendors would receive 25% on top of the market value. This would free much of the land and put a fire under those who are sitting on land across the country to sell it. While the Bill may have difficulties, they are not insurmountable. It needs the will of all parties in the House to support it and start the process of linking rents with the CPI. I would like the Minister to address the regulation of Airbnb. I have raised it several times before. Approximately 10,000 housing units in Dublin have been taken out of the private rental market and are being used for Airbnb. It is an unregulated market and people can charge what they like and provide accommodation whatever way they like. This summer, owing to the difficulties in getting accommodation in the city, I had the misfortune of using Airbnb several times. Some of the accommodation was not very pleasant. It did not do what it said on the pack. One is trying to get accommodation at the eleventh hour in the city and sometimes one ends up in a place in which one would not put a dog. To say implementing the Bill would affect the market is an excuse for doing nothing and I do not accept excuses for doing nothing.

As Senators will be aware, the Government has tabled a proposed amendment to the motion, as I did in the Dáil when this issue was brought forward by Sinn Féin. There are acute pressures in the rental market. These pressures are driven by a number of factors, including rising demand, a lack of supply and high costs that indebted landlords face in servicing loans.

The Senator can have it. I might go off-script at times; I have a reputation for doing so. As I said, there are acute pressures in the rental market and I outlined some of them. These stresses are borne out by the latest data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB. The PRTB index for the second quarter of this year shows that private rents rose by almost 10% across the country compared with the same period last year. In Dublin rents are now 3.9% higher than their previous peak in 2007. Rents are also increasing outside Dublin, although they remain at about 11.2% off their peak levels. These numbers are broadly in line with the trends reported in the recent daft.ie report for the same period. There is no question that the increases are placing huge pressures on tenants, particularly those who are seeking to access new accommodation and, in particular, on many people who are simply being priced out of the market, as has been pointed out, or put at serious risk of homelessness. The core issue behind almost all of the pressures throughout the housing market is lack of supply. For the rental sector, the best way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term and benefit the entire sector is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors. Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs. It sets out over 80 actions the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative measures in the budget to achieve that aim. A strong and viable private rental sector can play an important role in the housing market and the wider economy. It can provide a housing option for those who either cannot or choose not to enter the owner-occupied market but still have sufficient means to meet their own accommodation needs. It can provide a housing option to meet rising demand and promote flexibility and better alignment to a more mobile labour market, making it easier for individuals and families to pursue job opportunities or adapt their accommodation to changing family circumstances. It can also reduce the macroeconomic risk of an over-reliance on home ownership. We have seen examples in the past decade where states with relatively large private rented sectors such as Germany and Switzerland have been better insulated against housing booms than states with small rental sectors such as Ireland and Spain. The rental sector in Ireland has traditionally been regarded as a residual sector in which households who would prefer either to own their own home privately or access permanent social housing must serve time in on their way to their true tenure of choice. The rental sector in Ireland has doubled in size in the past two decades. Almost one fifth of the population now live in the rental sector. Growth in the sector has been driven by a range of factors, including a reducing reliance on home ownership as a tenure of choice, as well as demographic factors, including inward migration from the European Union, decreasing household size and increasing rates of new household formation. Notwithstanding that, the rental sector needs to develop and mature in order to provide a viable, sustainable and attractive alternative to home ownership rather than serving as a temporary refuge or a staging post on the route to home ownership. Severe supply pressures, rising rents, security of tenure issues, limited, but nonetheless unacceptable, examples of poor accommodation standards and a shortage of professional institutional landlords are impediments to delivering on a strong, stable and modern rental sector that offers real choice for individuals and households while contributing to economic development. With regard to rent levels, important amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act introduced last year mean that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies has increased from 12 to 24 months. This will apply for a four year period until 2019. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced also. These changes are important, but clearly there is need to do more. While I appreciate the motivation behind the Sinn Féin Bill, I strongly believe the proposal to tie rents strictly to the consumer price index may well exacerbate the problem we are facing. It may force some existing supply to exit the market and discourage future supply for the sector. The experience in jurisdictions where strict and blunt controls such as that proposed have been introduced is generally not a happy one. Rent control has been shown to negatively impact on supply, make tenants even more vulnerable and create strong black market distortions and inefficiencies that can emerge from time to time. I see rent predictability, as part of a stable rental sector underpinned by a sustainable investment environment, being of benefit to both tenants and landlords. That is why the Rebuilding Ireland document commits to developing a real and meaningful strategy for the rental sector, with a major focus on supply but also including new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents. We plan to have this done by the end of the year. We will start our consultation towards the end of next week and would be interested in anything people have to say in a constructive manner. In advance of publication of the strategy before the end of the year, I am advancing other legislative changes. In case people think we are not acting in this area, we are by taking some early actions to which we are already committed. They are included in the Rebuilding Ireland document and have already gone before the Cabinet for legislative approval. We are advancing their early introduction in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 which I will shortly introduce to this House. The Bill will introduce new measures to ensure tenants remain in situ where a landlord proposes to sell more than 20 units in a single development. It is being referred to as the Tyrrelstown amendment and will provide for enhanced enforcement and dispute resolution powers also for the RTB. We are saying that when one institutional investor sells a development to another, the tenancies in that development will not be affected by that sale. We need much more consideration of whether we will do something similar for much smaller developments or individual houses or apartments that may be owned by landlords that only have one or two properties. We will consider and examine that issue in detail. In terms of increasing supply, the Bill will introduce temporary fast-track planning arrangements for large-scale housing developments and streamline the existing process for local authority developments and developments by approved housing bodies and support a very significant increase in the supply of dedicated on-campus student accommodation, freeìng up thousands of units in the wider rented sector currently occupied by students. There are approximately 25,000 students in the private rental sector. Many have four or five students per house. We are not saying it will free up 25,000 houses, but it will certainly free up about one third of that number. There are approximately 10,000 new student accommodation units in the pipeline, either in preparation for planning, in planning or with planning permission and about to start construction. Yesterday’s Budget Statement contained more measures designed to encourage a strong supply response in the rental sector. For example, the Government has announced the restoration of 100% interest relief for residential landlords on a phased basis, 5% at a time, moving from 75% to 80% next year and continuing to 100% in the next five years. We are also extending the Living City initiative to include rental accommodation and removing the existing square footage cap.In other words, we are trying to encourage investment in derelict property, primarily in city and town centres, in order that people can invest in it and make it ready to be rented. That makes much sense. We are increasing the ceiling under the rent-a-room scheme from €12,000 to €14,000. In other words, we want to attract people financially to rent a room in their homes to students if it suits them to do so. By moving the level from €12,000 to €14,000 of tax-free income, there is a really strong sweetener in doing so. It will also have an impact on supply. I am determined that the strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term in the context of the Government's objectives for a housing sector overall as set out in Rebuilding Ireland. It will contain a range of actions focused on the four key areas of security, supply, standards and services. In terms of security, we will look at bringing greater tenure and rent certainty to landlords and tenants and, in terms of supply, we will examine how to maintain existing levels of stock, while encouraging investment in additional supply, including through affordable rental. We will launch the detail of that scheme in the coming weeks. In addition, measures on standards will continue to improve the quality and management of rental accommodation, while actions on services will broaden and strengthen the role and powers of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to more effectively provide services and empower tenants and landlords. In other words, if there are disputes between tenants and landlords, we need earlier outcomes to resolve them. We have more to do to allow this area to evolve into a mature, stable sector in which there is a true balance between the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants. Supply of new rental accommodation at affordable levels is key to this balance. The strategy for the rented sector which will be in place by the end of the year will lay out measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of rental accommodation. I agree with the speakers who have said they will oppose the Bill. It is well intentioned and I do not mean that in a patronising way. There is a problem for many because of the pressures they are under arising from rent inflation. An effort to solve that problem by using the blunt tool of simply providing for rent caps without anything else would have a very significant and potentially very negative impact on supply in the medium term. Ultimately, we need to see dramatic investment. I look forward to working with everybody in this House in the context of the housing legislation we will introduce in the next few weeks, I hope, when Members will be able to see some of the measures we are introducing now. I hope to get engagement in the broader consultation process that we will facilitate in the next few weeks in trying to put a balanced rental strategy in place that can deal with a multitude of pressures, ensure supply will continue and that predictability in the management of rents will also improve from a tenant and landlord perspective.

There are also dozens seeking a spot in a doorway or an alley, where the open, starry sky will provide their roof for the night. The rental market in Dublin and other cities in Ireland is in absolute chaos. The chronic shortage of rental properties is unsustainable and something must give. The shortage is getting worse by the month. As of August this year, just over 3,500 properties were available for rent across the State, 1,000 fewer than in August last year. Just 1,100 of these properties were available in this city. In the period since 2011, when rents bottomed out following the downturn, rents have risen by over one third. Monthly rents are 10% higher today than they were this time last year. My party introduced a rent certainty motion in the Dáil in June. At the time we were accused by Fianna Fáil, particularly its housing spokesperson, Deputy Barry Cowen, of "playing silly buggers" old politics with the issue. We were accused of attempting to undermine the work of the all-party committee on housing and our proposal was described as gutter stuff. My party certainly does not think it was silly buggers or gutter stuff. What is silly buggers is that here we are, nearly four months later, with the all-party committee having produced its recommendations but we still have no rent certainty. What is gutter stuff is that poor people are living in the gutter on a nightly basis because politicians have refused to act. I should be clear. Rent certainty is not rent control. Rent certainty provides protection for both tenants and landlords. The only way to deal with rapidly rising rents is through legislative change. If we attempt an economic solution to an economic problem, there will be only one outcome. That is the outcome we have witnessed in the past few years because we have refused to act. The market will only fix itself one way in times of lack of supply. The Government had a big opportunity yesterday to try to fix this problem, but Ireland's 720,000 renters were forgotten about. It is widely acknowledged that the first-time buyer's grant will purely increase prices for new builds and is a slap in the face for those renters who will never be able to consider buying with the current rental levels. The Fine Gael amendment is further proof that the Government is just kicking its heels on rent certainty, as it is on so many other aspects of housing policy. It speaks about recognising pressures, a comprehensive response, etc., and although the terms used in the amendment sound good, they will not make a blind bit of difference to the people about whom I have spoken who will be out queuing this evening to seek to put a roof over their heads. The longer measures like rent certainty are put off, the higher rents will rise and the more people will become homeless. This is a direct consequence of inaction. Rent certainty is needed. Those who say they support rent certainty should support the Bill tonight and the parties arguing that they support rent certainty should back it tonight. I appeal to Members to do the right thing. Let us send a message from the Seanad that we can make a proactive gesture to improve the lives of people across all sectors of society. Rent certainty will make a positive change so let us be positive and do it. It was interesting to watch yesterday's responses to the budget. We all agree that the Peter McVerry Trust is at the coalface of dealing with this matter and it saw the budgetary measures as a series of incentives for developers and landlords. It did not see any real leadership, vision or resources presented to deal with the matter. The Minister who has just left the Chamber and the Minister of State face big challenges in our society in housing and rent increases which are crippling people across the State. The Government is overly reliant on the private sector to address the housing crisis and provide what should be public housing across the State. I have no doubt that this is about ideology, specifically a right-wing ideology that believes it is better for the market and privatisation to address social challenges.

By the Senator's own admission, this is a simple Bill. We believe it is too simplistic and that this type of interference could cause more harm to an already chaotic rental market. The main factor in the increase in rents is lack of supply. Introducing a blunt cap at this stage is not the way forward. I recognise that there is a comprehensive social housing programme and firmly believe this is the proper mechanism by means of which to deal with this issue and tackle rising rents. Since the 2015 legislation was enacted, a market cap has been in place and it will remain in place for four years. Senator Paudie Coffey was part of the Government that introduced that legislation which has been quite helpful to tenants. The Sinn Féin housing policy aims to facilitate the building of 100,000 houses in 14 years. Sinn Féin wants builders to provide 20% social and affordable housing, a measure introduced by Fianna Fáil. Sinn Féin wants to set interest rates. It talks about lowering them and wants to manipulate the interest rate market and tell banks what they can and cannot charge. It wants to abolish the local property tax, introduce rent regulation and cap rents. It also wants to heavily increase taxes on companies, something we have heard on several occasions, and increase taxes on builders. All of these measures are not incentives to build more houses. We must be practical. These measures would not help us to build more houses. It is la-la economics and would leave us with a massive housing crisis akin to the one that Sinn Féin, as the largest party in Dublin, has overseen. Its hand is on the wheel in Dublin. We have talked about it. Senator Michael McDowell talked about land banks in the city centre that could be used to build houses.

We can all come here and provide heart-wrenching human stories involving people in our communities about which we hear every day. They are not statistics on a quarterly report - they are real people. If Members have not already done so, I ask them to read the action plan on housing and homelessness. It did not happen overnight and did not happen because people were not concerned. It happened because we are in the midst of the worst housing crisis ever. We can all apportion blame, but the people about whom Senator Padraig Mac Lochlainn spoke who will queue to view properties tonight or the people in Cork who will go into homeless shelters, search for emergency accommodation or sleep in hotel rooms need and want us to deliver for them. That is what the Government is about. Sinn Féin Members might want to listen to the contributions of the Minister, Senators Paudie Coffey and Michael McDowell and others. There are consequences involved. I speak not as a multiple home or property owner. As I own my own house, I am not flying the flag for anybody other than those who require housing. We cannot deal with issues in isolation. We must parse the various issues. Regardless of whether we like it, one of the fundamental problems in this housing crisis is the lack of supply. If one talks to auctioneers, landlords, tenants or people who want to buy, one will see that it comes down to supply. We do not have enough houses and that is the consequence of bad decisions made over a long period. I will cite two examples. We have seen the growth of Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork, both tremendous higher education institutions. The growth of Cork University Hospital is linked with it. What did we do in providing accommodation for students? We did nothing. As a consequence, vast swathes of areas are taken up by private rentals for students when they could be used to cater for people who want to buy or rent or the city council could take over some of the properties. As Senator Denis Landy said, people are now using Airbnb.  Senator Paudie Coffey talked about the legacy of the boom and bust cycle. We must ensure, as we have done in the budget, that we can get first-time buyers to purchase and have a private rental sector that will actually work to suit tenants. Regardless of whether Sinn Féin Members like it, we need landlords. In many cases, landlords are not pariahs. I have appeared before the PRTB with residents against landlords and do not fly the flag for them. However, we need landlords who are responsible and have houses to let as their main source of income in order that people can live in them. If we do not have them, we will get nowhere.  The fundamental difficulty is in the rental sector. I listen to Members giving out about what the Government is not doing. I will provide a couple of facts in order that we can debunk this myth. There was an action plan for housing within 100 days of the formation of the Government. I accept the all-party committee was set up under the chairmanship of Deputy John Curran, but the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department have been driving this, as has the Government. The one thing I have learned in opposition and government is that it is very easy to come here every day and criticise. Sinn Féin Members should go and talk to their colleagues in Northern Ireland and ask them what it is like to be in government. They will provide the answer.

I will give the Members opposite some figures. Up to €200 million has been allocated to the local infrastructure housing activation fund to remove infrastructure blockages to larger housing developments and, in turn, deliver more supply. A help-to-buy scheme has been announced for first-time buyers, with a tax refund of up to 5% of the value of the house, with a €20,000 cap. I know that the academics have had a field day before and since the Budget Statement. However, I have received telephone calls today from people who want to buy a house in Cork city but who tell me they cannot find one. We have given a 5% increase in tax relief for landlords in 2017 to encourage investment. One problem we have is with people with distressed mortgages in buy-to-let schemes and properties are in rag order. Some of the conditions of rental properties are sinful and immoral. I have a fundamental difficulty with how the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, does it business. We need to be more proactive in going after those landlords who do not treat tenants with respect. The increased threshold under the rent-a-room scheme to €14,000 will ease pressures on rents. An increase of €105 million under the housing assistance payment scheme will benefit 15,000 families. The four key areas in tenancies are security, supply, standards and services. Rather than divide the House, will Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh park the Bill? Like the housing committee in the Dáil, we should come together in a national movement to ensure supply is increased and we do not have the awful human tragedies of people living on the streets of our cities, not able to rent or buy a house. These are the very people we meet every day. There is nothing more distressing or upsetting than to be confronted with the possibility of losing a tenancy or being homeless. Political point scoring does not work. The Government is committed to dealing with the issue. Members opposite should join us in ending this scourge. Together we can go back to the people who have elected us to the Houses of the Oireachtas to improve their lives, which is a fundamental part of the budget.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	192	Senator Jerry Buttimer spoke about how we in the Chamber could all share stories about the housing crisis. I certainly would not make apologies - I would not expect him to do so either - for expressing the needs and concerns of those most marginalised. Sinn Féin is in government in the North and works at local government level too. One of the first events at which I met Senator Paudie Coffey was when he was Minister of State. It was at the launch two years ago of the Valhalla sheltered housing development in the heart of Clondalkin. Since that time, however, those on the South Dublin County Council housing list have continued a nine-year wait for social housing. We made decisions in South Dublin County Council which had 300 houses ready to go. Despite local authorities doing their utmost, they cannot do it alone. Queues of residents, homeless persons, students and young people hoping to find a room are commonplace in Dublin city. Every week night, the effect of years of policy inaction which started well in advance of the Government's term is visible as crowds gather to rent a property or room, some with deposits in hand, in hope that their names and references will be accepted by landlords. Now online property and rental sites feature rooms with multiple bunks. Staggering homeless figures are evidence of the horrific effect of the lack of affordable rental options. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, referred to the scenario facing students who need housing every September. He has said it affects 25,000 young people, but I have heard the figure is more likely to be 50,000. Market stability should be the long-term goal, with meaningful rental options on offer. Rent certainty gives students, young people and homeless persons security and a stake in a rental market that has all but left them behind. I encourage Senators from all parties to take significant and meaningful action tonight by voting for the Bill which supports affordability and tenancy rights, as well as what the organisations on the ground are telling us, namely, that providing certainty can be the start of a significant process in solving the crisis. Yesterday afternoon the tax and spend measures announced in the budget showed that Fine Gael was continuing the same failed housing policies which had dominated public policy for decades. The Minister for Finance's first-time buyer's scheme is available for homes up to the value of €600,000, a measure which will only drive prices higher. It is quite telling that the Government thinks struggling first-time buyers will consider a house purchase of between €400,000 and €600,000. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's increase in capital investment in social housing of €105 million will deliver only 900 new houses. That is not combined with the extra €17 million to be given to the housing associations which will deliver only 100 extra social houses. Sinn Féin believes the losers once again are those without a home and those who are struggling to keep their own.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine a labhair sa díospóireacht áirithe seo. An article in the Galway Advertiser in June, with the headline, “Huge rent increases across Galway”, puts this matter in context:Over the last 12 months, rent in Monivea has skyrocketed by almost 60%. In early 2015, average monthly rent in the area was €568, but the last year has seen a 57% increase, with prices now peaking at more than €894 per month. Over the course of a year, or 12 month lease, that represents an additional €3,912 that a tenant must pay to a landlord.Many Members might not be aware of it, but I did a degree in commerce and studied economics for a while. There is a fundamental flaw in some of the arguments put forward by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. They argue the reason rents are increasing is lack of supply. That is only an element of what is going on. When I was learning fundamental economics, we were told another issue in the lack of supply would be vultures coming into a market who would be willing to pay more because there would be less of the commodity available. That is what is happening in many cases in the housing market. Recently, a director of services in a local authority told me that they tried to buy houses coming onto the market with the moneys available to them. However, increasingly, they are seeing fellows in sharp suits, as he said, coming to sales representing the vulture funds. They will pay over the odds for any house coming onto the market. It is a little like the spike in oil prices and what is happening with sterling. Rents are increasing as a result of the increased yields for which the vulture funds are looking on their investments. There is talk about accidental landlords. The vulture funds are forcing those landlords out of the market and putting rents way up. Essentially what one has is extortion supported by Government policy. The vulture funds are taking the large sums of money, referred to in the article in the Galway Advertiser, from the pockets of people who are trying to make ends meet. There has been much talk about what is a normal functioning market. There are functioning markets in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. A part of their markets is having rent certainty. Mention was made of people getting out of the market. I would like to see the vulture funds get out of the market and not get as much money. I would like to see rents at a less volatile level. Rent certainty would deliver this. As for accidental landlords getting out of the market, there were some people who got involved in the property market at the height of the boom when prices were very high, as the auctioneers sitting to my left would know, paying way over the odds for housing stock

It is ironic that Senator Michael McDowell called our legislation mistaken but well intentioned. That from a man who was the leader of a former party the members of which were the architects of our boom and bust economy. Some of its former representatives in these Houses are the champions of the construction industry. They will definitely look to a more developer-led, privatised market because what we have is a fundamental difference of ideology. I welcome the Minister's measured remarks, to which I listened carefully, but there is a fundamental difference of opinion on ideology because he said he wanted to increase the amount of private housing in the entire housing sector.

That is the fundamental difference. We are not the only ones proposing rent certainty. There is a great deal of support for it. The organisations that support this approach are Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Depaul Ireland, Merchants Quay Ireland, Threshold, the Dublin Homeless Network and the Cork Homeless Network, to name but a few. These are the bodies which are dealing with people on the streets. They pick up the pieces after the failed strategies to date. I would take their opinion much more than I would take a lecture from the likes of Fianna Fáil about flawed legislation being brought forward. The Minister has said we need a long-term reaction to the crisis. We have never said rent certainty is the panacea that would fix everything, but we need an immediate intervention in the market to make a difference. Sinn Féin sees the Bill as a very small part of many measures we brought forward in our alternative budget. I am sure all Members have read it and I wish they would take more of our ideas on board. We believe the Bill is very important. I want to mention some of the suggestions made to us. We have suggested, within the fiscal space available, that in addition to introducing the rent certainty measures, an additional €8 million in funding be provided for domestic violence refuges, an additional €24 million for homelessness initiatives, €15.75 million for housing adaptation grants, an extra €10 million for the warmer homes scheme, €16.65 million for the local government fund-----

This is not about playing politics but about trying to make a difference. We are asking the Minister to help us make that difference. We welcome the support from Senators across the floor. I hope Fianna Fáil, even at this late date, would not support or at least abstain in the vote on the Government's amendment to the motion.

As Senators are aware, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to reform the judicial appointments process and introduce legislation on the establishment of a new judicial appointments commission. The judicial appointments Bill involves complex legal and constitutional questions which will require careful consideration, further consultation and teasing out of the most appropriate measures. I then intend to proceed to finalise a general scheme of the Bill and bring it before the Government for approval. Senators will be aware that, under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. It is an act of the Executive under the Constitution to advise the President on the persons to be appointed to judicial office. The current process for the appointment of judges is set out in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended, which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board as a recommending body. The role of the board is to identify persons through their own application or the board's invitation who are suitably qualified for judicial office. A process involving a wide-ranging review of all aspects of the law on the system concerning judicial appointments was commenced under the previous Government and has been referred to by me in previous contributions in this House and the Dáil. A consultation process on the system of judicial appointments was conducted by my Department in 2014 and it was acknowledged that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day but that it was time, after almost 20 years, to review the operation of the judicial appointments system to ensure it reflected current best practice having regard to international standards, that it was open, transparent, accountable and that it promoted diversity.There was an encouraging response to the call for submissions. A total of 27 submissions were received from a range of interested persons and bodies, including the Judicial Appointments Review Committee which is a committee of the Judiciary, the Bar Council, the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other civil society groupings, former judges, public representatives, university-based lawyers and private individuals. The submissions remain available to us and are of direct relevance in moving to the delivery of new legislation in this area. A number of reform themes emerged from the consultation process which, with the programme for Government commitment, are informing the preparation of the new legislation. Among the strongest ideas to emerge is the idea of the importance of ensuring the Judiciary retains the independence essential for discharging its constitutional function. I believe Ireland has a proud record in that regard. Another important idea is that the Judiciary should reflect, as far as possible, the diverse nature of society from which it is drawn, as is the idea that judges should be appointed on merit. I imagine the House will agree that our reforms must have regard to these important principles. Significant further work and critical consultation will be necessary in finalising the scheme for a new judicial appointments commission Bill. This is a priority for the Government and I look forward to bringing this legislative reform to the House at the earliest opportunity. There are a number of vacancies in the courts. There is one vacancy in the Supreme Court, two vacancies in the Circuit Court and one vacancy in the District Court. There are also two pending vacancies, one each in the Circuit Court and the District Court. Undoubtedly, there will be more in the coming period. The requirements of the administration of justice will be the over-riding priority for the Government in the period ahead as the necessary reforms are brought forward as expeditiously as practicable. It is intended to publish the judicial council Bill in this session. Considerable work has been done on it. The Bill will provide for the establishment of a judicial council to promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, as well as to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct. That legislation and the judicial appointments commission Bill will together provide for fundamental and far-reaching reform of the judicial system. Senators have called on me to address the issue of Garda pay. I am disappointed that the Garda Representative Association rejected the agreement reached with my Department in recent weeks and has announced an intention to take industrial action. It is disappointing that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is contemplating action, particularly in view of the positive outcome of the recent association ballot on the Lansdowne Road agreement. Members of the association accepted the proposal by a ratio of 70:30 some weeks ago. In the event that it proceeds, such action would be unprecedented and detrimental for society, An Garda Síochána, Garda morale and public confidence. I am committed to doing everything possible to find a solution within the very real constraints on public sector pay. Everything that can be done will be done. My focus and that of the Government is on negotiation and we are looking for a pathway to move forward. I have said consistently that all sides must continue to explore ways forward through further engagement. I met the GRA and the AGSI last week to hear first-hand their outstanding concerns. The meetings were constructive and I will continue to facilitate further engagement. The GRA will meet this week and I hope my officials and the GRA will be in a position to meet us before the end of the week, if not, then early next week. As Senators will be aware, the agreement reached between my Department and the GRA addressed in a positive way the issues raised by the GRA in the course of negotiations which took place over a number of months. In particular, the agreement sought to address the concerns articulated about the pay of new recruits, the additional hours gardaí were required to work, access to pay determination and dispute resolution bodies and the completion of the review of An Garda Síochána. The agreement we had reached included significant benefits, including the restoration of the rent allowance, worth over €4,000 annually, to new recruits, as well as lifting the increment freeze that had been in place since 1 July. It would be most unfortunate if, rather than engaging further, action was to be contemplated that would not be in the best interests of communities or An Garda Síochána. I have mentioned this on a number of occasions and imagine Senators will agree with me. Like all public servants, members of An Garda Síochána played a significant part and role in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery. They were subject to the same pay reductions as all other public servants over the course of the financial crisis years and similarly have benefited from the partial restoration of pay commenced on foot of the Lansdowne Road agreement. In working with them I am keen to find a way forward towards pay restoration that can be managed within the parameters laid down. The Government is conscious that the associations, as is the case with many public sector representative bodies, are frustrated at the pace of pay restoration. However, I imagine many Senators agree that the Government must take a sustainable and prudent approach to public sector pay. We are committed to the Lansdowne Road agreement as the framework for industrial relations and pay determination within the public service. Within this framework, the programme commits to the establishment of a commission for public sector pay to examine pay levels across the public sector, including entry levels of pay, and to the gradual negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts. As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, said in his Budget Statement yesterday, the public service pay commission will report to him by the middle of next year and provide inputs on how the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation should proceed. We will ensure all those represented do so on an equal footing. The resolution of outstanding issues of concern to the GRA or the AGSI can only be addressed through engagement between the parties and I urge them to engage in discussions before contemplating any action that, as I have said on numerous occasions, would not be in the best interests of communities or An Garda Síochána.

I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address these two important issues. The decision of An Garda Síochána to strike is not one with which Fianna Fáil supports or agrees. However, it shows that there is rampant demoralisation and anger within the force. We need a commitment from the Government that it does not intend to allow a stand-off between the Garda Representative Association and the State. It is essential that we see the Government re-engage with Garda representatives. We learned on 28 September that the Garda Representative Association had voted for industrial action for four days in November. Fianna Fáil immediately raised this issue in the Dáil. This is an unprecedented development which would have serious consequences not just for the Garda but also for the public. As we know, unlike other workers, gardaí do not have the right to strike. An Garda Síochána has always served the State with great pride and its members take an oath to defend the public and the State. However, as I said, the decision to strike, with which Fianna Fáil does not support or agree, nonetheless shows a rampant demoralisation. The Government has been aware that industrial relations issues have been brewing in the Garda for some time. It has been in place for five months and among the major issues on its agenda are public service pay and industrial relations problems within the public sector.In recent months deals have been done in respect of low grade entry level nurses and teachers and on allowances for firefighters, yet the Government only entered into what it thought would be an agreement with the GRA late on Friday, 23 September. It is to be regretted that it has stumbled and stalled in dealing with the challenges facing An Garda Síochána. It must recognise that reports by GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate will be meaningless unless An Garda Síochána has good morale within its force and believes its members are being respected and valued by the State and the Government. Morale is low because of the terms and conditions of gardaí. It is clear their grievances are not being treated seriously by the Government.  In the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáil, the Government agreed to establish a commission on public service pay. The Minister has said the commission will report in the middle of next year, but she did not specify when it would be established. Will she address that issue? I am calling on her to give a commitment that the Government will engage with the GRA to defuse the situation immediately.  I will touch on the issue of judicial appointments. Fianna Fáil recently published a Bill to provide for the establishment of an independent judicial appointments commission to recommend persons for appointment to judicial office based solely on merit. The timescale and delay by the Government in dealing with the issue has prompted Fianna Fáil to put forward its own Bill. We are fortunate in Ireland to have a staunchly independent Judiciary. This is in spite of, rather than because of, the system of appointing judges. Fianna Fáil’s legislation would provide for an independent commission that could recommend and rank, based solely on merit, a small group of substantially qualified persons to be nominated. A merit-based system of appointment would enhance the principle of judicial independence. Publishing the Bill would remove the possibility of Government foot dragging any longer in establishing a judicial appointments commission which would be required to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality based on merit.  The Minister touched on the vacancies in the Judiciary and we call on her to fill them as a matter of urgency. There is no reason they cannot be filled.

On the issue of Garda pay, I am very disappointed by the decision taken by gardaí to engage in industrial action on four Fridays in November. There is a strong possibility that the AGSI will join them. It will be a very sad day for the country and the Garda. It is regrettable and disappointing that the issue has been allowed to develop to this point, although I fully appreciate that the Minister has only been in office a short period of time. We have to be aware that pride and morale in the Garda are probably at an all-time low. It is important to send a message as a country that we need to protect the people who protect us. We need to protect those who, when they go out to work in the morning or the evening, may not come back home alive. There are very few workers who have those working conditions in their daily lives. We need to accept and appreciate that and acknowledge that gardaí are different for the reasons I have outlined. They are also very reasonable. We all know them in our everyday lives. I call on the Minister to engage fully with gardaí and use all of her resources to adequately address the outstanding issues that need to be addressed. I welcome the tone of her comments and have no doubt that if she engages fully, a solution can be found to this problem in order that we can move on and remove the threat that hangs over the Garda and communities.

I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I thank her for coming om response to a suggestion I made that this debate should happen. I thank the Leader of the House for arranging it. The particular issue about which I was concerned was the question of judicial appointments in view of media reports that a moratorium on the appointment of judges had been put in place at Cabinet level pending the passage of the legislation outlined in the programme for Government. I note what has been said about the Fianna Fáil Bill. I have had an opportunity to look at Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill and it seems that the principle is preferable to that adumbrated in the programme for Government. I am deeply concerned that the model proposed in the programme for Government of an inexpert majority on the appointments commission would lead to poor rather than good results. The principle in Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill is better; it would provide that the advice of people who knew what they were talking about would be made more focused and available to the Executive. It strikes me that Senator Victor Boyhan has been advancing the proposal to have the judicial council legislation brought forward and considered at an early date. The Minister will know that it is a long-standing chestnut in her Department. I was recently interested to see judicial impatience at the level of progress made. There was a time when the impatience was all in St. Stephen's Green and it was the Judiciary who were on the receiving end of correspondence from impatient Ministers. It is important that the Judiciary have the relevant institutions to enable it to function to the best possible standard in the eyes of the public. There is no longer any opposition to the idea of a judicial council, although there was at one point; therefore, this is the time to get on with it. If Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill receives the favour of Dáil Éireann where I presume it will be introduced, the Government should adopt and get on with it rather than going through the process of developing its own model. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill could be amended if it was the will of that House and this one, but it would be pointless in having two alternative views competing in the form of two separate Bills and delay action until the Government prepared its own Bill in this respect. Reference has been made to the Garda pay issue. I do not want to put any further political pressure on the Minister. I understand completely the circumstances in which she finds herself. Everybody, including her, will agree with me that An Garda Síochána needs to be treated as a special case because its members carry out special functions and are deprived of certain rights which others in the community enjoy in negotiating their own wages and conditions. The idea of a two-tier wage structure within An Garda Síochána is unacceptable. Across Ireland there are people who believe they are being policed by gardaí who live 50 or 60 miles away and are driving to work and going home to wherever they live. Will the Minister confirm whether the Garda Reserve which could serve to establish local roots for An Garda Síochána in every community will be expanded and have its numbers increased? It is no threat to Garda status or pay, but it would be a huge bonus in linking members of An Garda Síochána with communities in the way they were in the past when it was common for the local sergeant to live above the Garda station.

I want to make a number of comments on judicial appointments with reference to what is contained in the programme for Government.I welcome the Minister's comments on the judicial council. There is no mention of it in the programme for Government, only three paragraphs on judicial appointments. Articles 34 and 37 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland regulate the courts and outline generally how judges are to be appointed. The President of Ireland appoints judges on the advice of the Government. In practice, the decision to appoint a person to the Judiciary is made by the Minister for Justice and Equality. He or she is under no legal obligation to accept a person recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB. These are facts. The JAAB is a statutory body. It has no role in appointing a person who is already a judge to a judicial appointment such as a higher court than the one in which he or she sits. This critical point is somewhat lost. The JAAB creates a list of at least seven people whom it recommends for appointment. The Government is under no obligation to accept any of these recommendations. In practice, there is no review of a decision on the appointment of a judge. The JAAB does not have the power to rank the names on the list in order of preference or merit. Neither is the Government obliged to select any one of those recommended by the JAAB. The JAAB has no role in the appointment to a judicial office of a person who is already a judge. If a judge of the Circuit Court is to be appointed to the High Court, no provisions of section 16 of the 1995 Act apply. The programme for Government sets out three simple paragraphs on political judicial appointments. How can we progress the matter? There is no doubt that reform is needed in this area. It is important to set out the facts of where we are. I want to hear how we will change from the status quo to the Tánaiste's proposals.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	215	I, too, welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  We are discussing very important aspects. For too long, the system of judicial appointments has not been dealt with. I share Senator Michael McDowell's concern about a moratorium. The legislation the Tánaiste proposes is a very important incremental step forward in tidying up the process. We have been very lucky to have an effectively unblemished record of judicial decency and honour. We have great judges, many of whom are coming out of retirement to do the State further service. It shows the calibre of the people who served on the Bench during the years. On the difficulties faced regarding An Garda Síochána, I call on all parties to continue engagement. The rank and file members of An Garda Síochána do not want to go on strike. They do not want disciplinary issues or the public to feel afraid that there may be an increase in crime on the allocated days. The responsibility is on the Garda representatives and the Government to engage and continue to engage. I have no doubt the issues will be ironed out. I agree that there is a special case for An Garda and perhaps we should debate it. They are one of the few groups of public servants who put themselves in the line of danger and some have lost their lives. Garda Tony Golden's anniversary mass was yesterday. The Garda Commissioner, Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality this morning and gave a phenomenal performance, although it was all about one issue. Enormous transformation is taking place across An Garda Síochána. The Garda College Templemore has reopened and new recruits are coming in. The Government has committed to the recruitment of an additional 800 gardaí per year in the coming years. There is a programme for change to modernise the structures of the force, including ICT. Millions of euro have been invested in Garda vehicles. The provision whereby civilians can do certain behind the desk tasks is happening. There will be the recruitment of senior management personnel to ensure An Garda Síochána has the necessary skills base to do its work. It is a very exciting time for An Garda Síochána. Let us not forget that the quarterly behaviour and attitudes survey shows that more than 85% of the public have confidence in An Garda Síochána, which is a world record compared with the figures for other police forces. Three or four years ago the level of public confidence stood at 67% which was still much higher than in other countries. Less than 15% of the population do not have confidence in An Garda Síochána. Given the programme of transformation, steered by a phenomenal Garda Commissioner with a phenomenal work ethic and supported by the Tánaiste and the Government, the next few years will be very exciting for An Garda Síochána. I sincerely hope the little difficulties in terms of pay will be resolved, bearing in mind that the whole country has suffered pay cuts in recent years. Perhaps we might consider creating a special case for the men and women of An Garda Síochána.

There is a degree of unity in the Chamber on the Tánaiste's proposal regarding judicial reviews. We all acknowledge, as the Tánaiste did in her contribution, that the process is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. Going back many years, it has been Sinn Féin's position that the issue of judicial appointments needs to be reviewed and the position changed to become compliant with a more independent ethos. It is right for the Judiciary and those who find themselves engaging with it. Given that it has been our position, I remind the House of the Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013 which my colleague, Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, brought before the previous Dáil. Unfortunately, the Government opposed it. However, it is not the time to look back. There is heart to be taken from the Tánaiste's acknowledgement that she would like to see independent oversight and the shade of independence in judicial reviews become institutionalised. Is there a timeframe for this to happen? While we can all get into the nuances of it when it come before us and no doubt Members will do so, for all of the reasons previous speakers outlined, we need to know when it will happen and need it to be expedited, not in a haphazard way but in a way that will bring it to the fore sooner rather than later.
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	217	The Tánaiste is very welcome.  I will deal with the impending Garda strike. Week after week public sector workers are making the difficult and, in certain instances, unprecedented decision to take industrial action. We have had the Luas and Dublin Bus drivers make that decision. Now it is gardaí who have made it and soon it will be the teachers and nurses who will make it.We are seeing a mass movement across the public sector demanding fair pay and proper working conditions. These workers endured austerity budget after austerity budget in which the State took rights from them year on year and now they are telling it: "Pay us what we are worth, or else we'll down tools and leave you to it.” It has got so bad that today we are debating the unprecedented move by gardaí to vote to take industrial action. We need to recognise this anger and frustration over public sector pay will not go away any time soon but is gathering momentum. The Tánaiste needs to get to grips with this soon because the vote by gardaí to take industrial action is serious. It is a reality check for those among her civil servants or her ministerial colleagues who seem to be playing hard ball on these issues.  We are seeing recently recruited members of An Garda Síochána on starting salaries of €23,500. To put the matter in context, that is about one third of what we earn before we get our expenses and they have a much tougher job than we have. They sleep in cars because they are unable to afford spiralling rent costs. They drive all the way from places such as Tipperary to Dublin every day, from their parents' homes, just to turn up for work because they cannot afford to live in Dublin.  On the broader morale front, given the continuous issues about whistleblowers, gardaí do not feel safe to make protected disclosures. When new gardaí starting on a salary of €23,500 read the Comptroller and Auditor's General's report on a €150,000 slush fund to buy presents for senior gardaí in Templemore, how does the Tánaiste think that will affect the morale in the workforce? Yesterday the Government gave Deputies a very generous €5,000 annual pay increase, but it still has not restored the rent allowance for gardaí. We begin to get a clearer picture of the choices we make and the choices the Tánaiste's Government has decided to make.  To be clear, Sinn Féin supports the right of any worker to engage in industrial action for better terms and conditions and we support the right of gardaí to do so. We believe the Garda Commissioner, Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan, and her senior team must now put in place a contingency plan for policing on those dates. If the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, joins the action of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, it will leave 160 superintendents, 42 chief superintendents and eight commissioners, including the chief, Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan, manning the force, according to the Garda figures we have available. The Garda Reserve, a force of 1,100 unpaid civilian volunteers, would most likely need to be deployed also.  There is a scandal of low pay and poor working conditions in the public sector and this domino effect we are seeing is no surprise. The only surprise is it has not happened sooner. The Government needs to act with urgency and enter further negotiations with the GRA. Yesterday we heard about the political centre. The problem, as I alluded to in another debate today, is that the Government does not occupy the political centre. Unfortunately, it occupies quite a position on the hard right, which is why so many public sector workers are voting with their feet.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	218	I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. I also welcome the opportunity to have this debate.  As other colleagues said, a consensus has been breaking out across the House on the need for reform of judicial appointments. As the Minister said, this is very much an ongoing issue on which there has been extensive consultation. At the justice committee last year, at my instigation, we conducted a hearing on the subject of judicial appointments. I hope we forwarded the transcript of that hearing to the Tánaiste and her Department to inform the consultation process and the discussion on reform. I believe we all agree with the Tánaiste's comment that any system of judicial appointment must be open, transparent and accountable and promote diversity. In the debate on the nature of the reform, I make three points about how reform should be carried out. The first is to emphasise the critical point that reform should not be long delayed, or at least that the process should not delay the much-needed appointments of judges. The Tánaiste referred to the vacancies in the courts - one vacancy in the Supreme Court, two in the Circuit Court and one in the District Court. One of the complaints most frequently made to me by stakeholders or clients, people who come into contact with the legal system, concerns the delay in the giving of judgments. I know of some appalling delays in the handing down of judgments; there are outstanding judgements in particular cases. It is a matter of real concern that we do not see a delay in the appointment of judges, leading to delays in the judicial process for individual litigants and people appearing before the courts. That is one concern. A second issue regarding reform is acknowledging that the current model, as pointed out by Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill in her extensive research on judicial selection procedures, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, is not using the powers available to it to the extent originally anticipated when it was established in 1995. It has taken a very narrow view of its own powers, particularly since the early 2000s. Dr. Carroll MacNeill has clearly documented this and it is well known in the public domain as Dr. Elaine Byrne and others have written about it. Under the legislation the JAAB could, for example, put forward for nomination to the Minister only seven names. Senator Victor Boyhan has pointed out that it does not have power to rank, but putting forward only seven names in itself would send a message to any Minister. Instead we are routinely seeing well over that number being put forward to Ministers and that is documented in the book. The power to interview or put forward candidates is not being used and has never been used by the board. Therefore, there are some issues that need to be examined. If legislation seeks to reform, it must be implemented. Any new body or a reformed JAAB must be properly resourced in order to be able to implement powers such as the power to interview. Certainly these powers would circumscribe the process of appointments more.  Another point made concerns the need to extend the power to the promotion of judges where existing judges seek promotion. There are some issues with reforms, but the failure to implement or use existing powers in legislation must also be noted. We need to guard against any affinity bias. I know that the judges' submission to the Minister called for more of a role for the Judiciary. There is an issue where members of the Judiciary are self-appointing, but that becomes hugely problematic. I believe all Members agree that in any reformed judicial appointments body, there should be less, not more, of a role for serving judges. This affinity bias, where people tend to promote or appoint people who are like them, tends to stifle diversity in appointments. We should be critical of problems and flaws within the system, but we should also note that there are some ways in which the judicial appointments process has been very effective, for example, in having increased gender diversity in the Judiciary. In 2003 we published a study of gender discrimination in the legal professions in Ireland. At that point there were low numbers of women in the Judiciary at all levels. That position has improved significantly since 2003, which is to be welcomed. We are seeing a more representative Judiciary, at least in terms of gender, which is to be welcomed. Some elements of the appointment process are working well and that also should not be overlooked in any debate on reform. Ruadhán Mac Cormaic's recent book on the Supreme Court makes that point, namely, that judicial independence has been well established in the State and that whatever the flaws in the procedure, we have been well served generally by the Judiciary. I am aware that we will have a debate on judicial independence in the House next week, at the behest of Senators Victor Boyhan and Michael McDowell, when we will be able to say more about that issue. Turning to the proposed strike by gardaí, this is the second cause of a crisis in policing. In recent weeks we read the revelations about the treatment of whistleblowers in the force and await the report from the retired High Court Judge Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill on that issue. Clearly, the proposed strike is very much a second cause of a crisis in which rank and file gardaí are planning to take industrial action in November. Other colleagues have talked extensively about the issue of Garda pay which is one of the issues that has prompted the 95% vote in favour of industrial action. I want to focus on another issue, that of access to State negotiations, in particular to national negotiations such as those on the Haddington Road and Croke Park agreements. The issue of gardaí and the right to negotiate is not new. While section 18 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 prohibits members of An Garda Síochána from joining trade unions, they can join associations, but their representative associations are not privy to the national negotiations on pay and conditions. We know that in 2013 the European Committee of Social Rights issued a decision that Ireland was in breach of its international obligations under the European Social Charter, among other things, because of the prohibition on the representative associations from joining national employee organisations such as Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. I draw attention to the Industrial Relations (Members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces) Bill 2015, introduced in the Dáil in 2015 by my then Labour Party colleague, Michael McNamara, which, among other things, would have provided for the right of Garda representative bodies to join umbrella groups such as ICTU.Mr. McNamara pointed out that provisions like ours that were in place in France had resulted in judgments against the French Government by the European Court of Human Rights. He also pointed to the need for us to comply with the European Social Charter. This year the Tánaiste indicated that she would seek a resolution of the issues concerning the charter and that the findings of the European committee had been referred for consideration as part of an independent review under the Haddington Road agreement. Has that review been concluded or will the Tánaiste be in a position to accept a Bill such as Mr. McNamara’s which was not accepted by the Government at the time, given the context of a speech in which she stated there was an ongoing review of these issues? This is a significant bone of contention because it leads directly into issues of low pay, conditions of work, sick leave, hours of work and so on in An Garda Síochána that have given rise to the 95% vote in favour of strike action. I ask that we see our way to resolving this issue, being mindful of the finding against us at European level and the fact that Private Members' legislation has been introduced that proposes reasonable propositions in terms of the rights of gardaí. It was anomalous that, in the Haddington Road agreement negotiations, representatives of the Garda and the Defence Forces were barred from participating, while representatives of prison officers and firefighters rightly participated.

I will first address the issue of Garda pay, on which the House focused. We want to negotiate and use every opportunity possible to deal with the concerns raised by the GRA and the AGSI. In a ballot of AGSI members several weeks ago, the ratio was 70:30 in favour of accepting the work done by officials on the Lansdowne Road agreement. That matter was agreed two weeks ago. There were areas in which there was consensus and progress was made, but when the GRA team reverted to its executive, the executive expressed a range of concerns and the association was not in a position to go further with the agreement, which I regret. I met the GRA recently to discuss its concerns. It has stated that it wants to continue working with us on how to chart a path forward. That is in the context of the 285,000 public sector workers who have accepted the Lansdowne Road agreement and the 21 unions that have worked with the Government on unwinding the FEMPI legislation. Everyone knows how important it is that we manage the economy well. We are reaching out to address people's concerns as much as possible, but there are constraints. It would not be realistic of me to claim otherwise. I take the point made by many Senators about the important role An Garda Síochána plays in defending citizens against criminal elements. Gardaí are on the front line. As Senator Martin Conway mentioned, Tuesday was the anniversary of the death of Garda Tony Golden who was doing his job and responding to a call. My thoughts this week are with his family, Nicole and his very young children. It was an appalling tragedy and act of criminality. We must be conscious that gardaí put their lives on the line. Senator Ivana Bacik asked about mechanisms. After the European Confederation of Police, EuroCOP, found that the State was in breach of certain aspects of the charter, I referred its finding to the review then under way in the context of the Haddington Road agreement. There was a change in personnel and the process under Mr. Ray McGee who had done some of the work did not continue, but Mr. John Horgan is now working with the Garda to finalise the review. I expect it to be finalised by the end of December. We are agreeable in principle to the Garda associations having like access like other public sector representative bodies to future pay determination mechanisms and statutory dispute resolution processes, for example, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. That would be helpful. I take the point that being outside of the Haddington Road agreement process was not helpful. I hope in the progress we can make through the review we will chart a roadmap towards having access to these mechanisms. Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee asked about the public sector pay commission. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will table recommendations in the coming weeks on the establishment of the commission which I hope will be established early in the new year. The timeframe for the body's first report has been brought forward to the middle of the year. Senators referred to public sector unions and workers and I hope the commission will be a useful mechanism for examining contrasts in public sector and private sector pay and giving a voice to the various stakeholders. A number of Senators mentioned the level of anger within the Garda. As I have acknowledged, gardaí are like many workers in that they have been through a difficult period. There were high levels of overtime, but overtime was stopped, as was recruitment, and there was no investment for a period. All of this has impacted on morale, as have the ongoing pay issues. Thankfully, the economy can now support investment. The previous Government restarted that investment, which I am continuing. I hope that this will make a difference to morale. I accept that pay issues are front and centre and we will do everything possible to address them. Various options are available as regards protected disclosures. I have taken a decision on how the two most recent disclosures should be handled. For the various whistleblower complaints that have crossed my desk and that of GSOC, there is also the option of a GSOC investigation. I do not want to do anything that would interfere with GSOC's investigations and it is important that they proceed at its pace. As part of the agreement, there was a commitment to restore rent allowance to the 700 or 800 gardaí affected. I would be concerned by any irregularity in audits and accounting at the Garda College in Templemore, for which the Garda Commissioner is Accounting Officer. Some of the issues are historical, but they will undoubtedly be addressed and appropriate action will be taken. The difficulties were found in the audit carried out in Templemore. Turning to judicial appointments, we have received some advice and are seeking more on the matter. Complex legal and constitutional issues are involved. Senator Michael McDowell has written about them, while Senator Victor Boyhan has raised a number of concerns. The roles of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, and the Government are distinctive. As I have often stated, neither the Government nor its predecessor ever went outside the JAAB's recommendations. That is important. We have an appointments process, but it is in need of change. We will have interesting discussions on the format and type of change necessary, but we all agree on some of the key principles - that appointments should be made on merit and that there should be a maintaining the strong constitutional issues that arise in that regard. Senator Victor Boyhan made suggestions concerning the scope available to the Government. The advice I have received is in agreement with him in that respect.Deputy Jim O'Callaghan does have a Bill which I will certainly examine very carefully to see what progress we can make because it is a priority for the Government, as is the judicial council Bill. I again recognise what has been said about delays in the past. Delays were caused by a variety of factors and we are committed to dealing with the issue. A lot of work has been done on that Bill and it will be published this term. Both pieces of legislation are on the A list and we are putting on the A list only those Bills that will be published. It is not like in the past where there was a very long list of A Bills. The last time we reached ten of the 11 pieces of legislation on the A list. It is the absolute intention that the Bills will be published this term and that as much progress as possible will be made on them. No doubt we will have interesting discussions on whether there should be a lay or a legal majority, an issue on which there will be different points of view. International practice suggests there ought to be some lay members. What the proportion should be will be a subject for discussion, but many jurisdictions have lay chairpersons. For example, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority which we have just established has an independent lay person in charge. They are the decisions we will be teasing out and I look forward to hearing what Members will have to say about it.  They are the main points raised in both areas and I will leave it at that.
