#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	It is proposed to take No. 42, statements on the carbon budget; and No. a4, Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2009 — Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 42 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 65 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, who may share their time, and which shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (ii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 5 minutes.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 42, statements on the carbon budget, agreed to?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	This proposal is not agreed to.  The behaviour of the Government, in the context of the way it wants to do its business, is the most arrogant of any Administration I have ever seen.  The Order of Business is absolutely contemptuous.  It is proposed that we take statements on the carbon budget for 65 minutes and then guillotine the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill at 6.30 p.m.  Only 16 Members of my party have had the opportunity to speak on the latter, and then for only five minutes each.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	If Deputy Kenny had heard what the Members of this party had to say on the Bill last night, he would be happier if they had refrained from contributing.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Well said.  We were all impressed with the old rubbish uttered by Deputy Kennedy.

Wait until the Members opposite return to their constituencies.  They will not repeat to their constituents what they said here.  They would be terrified to do so.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Deputy Kenny, without interruption.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Deputy Kennedy only talks old rubbish.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I must inform the Tánaiste, who represents a constituency in the north west, that what she is attempting to do here is both contemptuous and disgraceful.  The Government is acting in a way that is completely contradictory to the norm.  Ned Kelly is famed in song and story for robbing the rich to help the poor.  The Government has made many people very rich and has left them untouched while it tramples on the poorest of the poor in society.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	She may believe that by alienating the public service, the members of which are obliged to deliver a huge range of services on a daily basis, the Government is influencing those in the private sector who cannot obtain loans from any of the banks.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This is a Second Stage speech.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	In the meantime, there are those in receipt of pensions in excess of €100,000 and gross incomes of well over that amount who have been left untouched.  The Tánaiste, as deputy leader of the Government, seems to be of the view that it is fine to take €8.60 from people who care on a full-time basis for their loved ones — mothers, fathers and other family members — be they incontinent or suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and that everything will be fine and rosy in the garden.What the Government is doing is absolutely disgraceful.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	That is true.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	At the same time, the Tánaiste appears to be of the opinion that it is possible to create a situation whereby this Fianna Fáil-led Government will obtain great support from the private sector because it took on the public sector and walked all over those in receipt of the lowest rates of social welfare payments.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	What does the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, have to say to that?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	That is not good politics.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, challenged Fine Gael to put forward an alternative view prior to the budget.  We duly produced a costed, detailed document which, if accepted, would have achieved €4 billion in cuts while protecting children, pensioners, those with disabilities, the blind and the carers.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Shame on the Minister of State.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Our proposals would also have protected the 55,000 public sector workers who earn less than €30,000.  They would also have provided an €18 billion stimulus for job creation in an area — namely, key infrastructure — in respect of which Ireland has fallen so far behind other countries that it has lost a serious amount of ground in competitive terms.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	35	If the Tánaiste thinks she can come in here and do whatever she wants, she has another thing coming.  It is very easy for the former Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to talk tough from the comfort of a State car with an armed garda.  He should remember that the bottom line is that the garda is there to protect State property, which is the car and not the Minister of State.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We cannot hear Deputy Michael Ahern.  We could not hear him when he was a Minister of State either.

The Government has now given them an unmerciful belt in the solar plexus and has lost all authority to negotiate with them.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The Government will not be able to achieve public sector reform.  It has done down the private sector and walked on those in receipt of social welfare.  I propose rejecting this Order of Business to allow for the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill to be returned to the House next Tuesday so that every Member will be given the opportunity to express a view on it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Government took €4 off the old age pension by not granting the Christmas bonus.

It is so arrogant that it wants to put this Bill through, round up all its people, round up its six strays and get them in here this evening to vote on a measure——
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Deputy Gilmore is a bit of a stray himself.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Unlike Deputy Power I am a voluntary stray.  Deputy Power has been compulsorily strayed.  This Government is attempting to pass a social welfare Bill to take money from the blind and those providing care in the home for sick members of their family rather than having them in institutional care at greater cost to the State.  The Bill also takes money from widows and from people paid less than €600 per week, while top bankers on €500,000 a year are not touched.  The Government is doing this in a way that treats the Dáil with contempt.  It also did so yesterday.It is questionable whether the social welfare Bill is properly before the House.  Yesterday, my colleague Deputy Shortall opposed the order proposed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  The Ceann Comhairle called a vote on it, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs overruled the Ceann Comhairle and no vote was taken on it.  This raises the question of whether the social welfare Bill is properly before the House.  Politically, the Government is attempting to get Deputies Healy-Rae, Lowry, Grealish, McDaid and the two strays from Sligo to vote to cut money from people who are blind, those providing care, the widowed and those in bad circumstances before Members get back to their constituents.  This is a political order to get the social welfare Bill through before Deputies are exposed to constituents discussing it with them.  The Labour Party will not agree to this order.  This is the height of arrogance and it adds insult to the injury inflicted on these people last Wednesday.

Regarding the commencement of the social welfare Bill yesterday, I have taken the unusual step of having the record of the House checked.  It is crystal clear that the Minister moved the correct motion, namely, "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."  That is the end of the matter.

I have no difficulty in clarifying the position and I accept there was some mild confusion at the commencement of the debate.  As a rule, the Chair does not do action replays and I am duty bound to expedite the business of the House in accordance with Standing Orders.  I intend to faithfully uphold the rulings of my predecessors in that regard.

I wish to correct one point in respect of Deputy Gilmore's portrayal of the now famous six, who he refers to as strays.  If one takes a look at them, there is only one stray among the six and the other five are clearly prodigal sons.  All too sadly, they will return to the fold as the need presents.We have before us a Bill that the Government wants to force through, from Second Stage to Report and Final Stages, by 6.30 p.m.  This is a serious Bill with widespread consequences for hundreds of thousands of the most marginalised people across the State.  We are being asked to accept the limited opportunity presented to discuss it but also that Deputies must vote on the measures without proper perusal and debate.  We have a responsibility to give every Bill a fair hearing and careful scrutiny.  I wonder if the powers of the Ceann Comhairle allow him to intervene and make a judgment in the interests of the people and this assembly that what was forced through on the Order of Business yesterday in respect of the ordering of the conduct of debate on this Bill was in contravention of all norms that should apply in this House.This is a serious Bill, with major consequences for many people.  It is a travesty.  This Government might as well rule by decree from Government Buildings, such is the contempt it shows this Chamber and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs who are directly responsible are not even in the Chamber as we consider how this Bill will proceed this morning.  I and the Sinn Féin Members absolutely object, not only to the ordering but to the absolutely disgraceful intent of this legislation.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	80	My point of order is in the interests of Deputy Healy-Rae.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows from his study of history, this party always fought for the right to free speech.  I would like to hear Deputy Healy-Rae.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Hear, hear.

If they were short of people like myself and Deputy Michael Lowry to make up the numbers in this House they would be damn glad to have us.  The trouble is that they——
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Deputy knows his place.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	We move on to the Order of Business.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	87	On a point of order, we have just dealt with a time motion limiting speaking times to 15 minutes in each case.  If it is a Minister, will the Ceann Comhairle, like yesterday, allow double that time for Ministers despite the order?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We were over this territory yesterday.  I explained in the Chamber that, because of persistent procedural querying in the Chamber, the Minister did not have the opportunity to deliver her Second Stage reading.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	89	That does not change the order.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	90	For the proper functioning of the House, the Ministers and the other Members must be allowed to have their say in the House.  If we have persistent procedural querying on a number of issues——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	94	As the Deputy knows, all of these matters are at the discretion of the Chair and I will endeavour to be even-handed about it.  I call Deputy Kenny.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Have arrangements yet been made for discussion on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill which is to be debated next week?  Is this to be guillotined through as well or has the Chief Whip made arrangements for full and comprehensive discussion of the Bill next week?Has the Government considered having the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform call in the Garda Commissioner in respect of threatened industrial action——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Order in the House.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	98	We will allow the Members who wish to exit to do so.  Silence, please.  Deputy Kenny is in possession.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I will ask the question again.  What are the arrangements for the discussion on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill, in which there is much interest?  Is this to be guillotined through next Tuesday or Wednesday, or have arrangements been made in that regard?What is the current situation arising from the GRA's decision to ballot its members for industrial action?  Nobody wants to see a situation like this.  Is the Minister in discussion with the Garda Commissioner and does he intend to meet the GRA?  Strict guidelines pertain here.  Nobody wants a situation where this is followed through.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	100	On the ordering of next week's business, it is proposed that discussions will take place on the legislation on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.  On the other matter, although it is outside the remit of the Order of Business, I welcome what has been said by the Members of the Opposition in this regard.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I am not sure the Tánaiste satisfactorily answered the question she was asked, which concerned the arrangements for the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill next week.  It is this Bill that will cut the pay of workers earning less than €600 a week by 5%.  According to the schedule that has been circulated for next week, the Government intends to pull the same stunt on that Bill that it is pulling on the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill this week, starting Second Stage on Tuesday and running it for as long as possible, keeping Committee Stage as short as possible and having all the votes on Wednesday.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	This is not relevant to the House.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It is relevant to 330,000 people.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	104	While the Labour Party promises the sun and the stars.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	That procedure is designed to minimise the opportunities for amendments to be proposed to the legislation and to minimise the number of times Government TDs will have to vote on the specific provisions of the Bill.  It is clearly concluded on the Government side that it is politically easier to sell a general vote on the Bill with a wrapped up motion that the Bill pass with all amendments acceptable to the Minister than to have Government Deputies voting specifically on each section.  Otherwise they would have to vote this week, for example, on the section dealing specifically with the cuts applying to carers and the blind and next week the cuts to the low paid.These arrangements are designed to provide as much cover as possible to a cowardly Government that wants to rush this through with a guillotine instead of standing over the votes they are casting to make cuts to those who cannot afford them.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	We are talking about the Order of Business for next week.  Tuesday and Wednesday are the days being considered for the legislation and if the Whips want to sit later on those nights that could be arranged during the normal discussions they have to prepare business.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	107	This is a complicated Bill and many who work in the public service are concerned about its vague nature when it comes to pension arrangements.  Will the Minister for Finance offer a briefing to Opposition Deputies and has he received the advice of the Attorney General?  Reducing the salary and conditions of public servants is a complex issue in the context of Irish law.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Deputy is anticipating the debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	109	This is very important.  This is the first time in the history of the State that the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance has cut the wages and entitlements of public servants.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	110	We did it in 1933.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	111	There will be ample opportunity for the Deputy to make these points next week.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We have no information about the impact of the legal structure under which this is proposed.  There is no information and very little time.  Will the officials of the Minister's Department provide a briefing to Opposition spokespersons on the genuine complexities of this Bill?People all over Ireland are worried sick this weekend about their jobs, their pay, their conditions and the pensions.  Fianna Fáil does not agree but that is a fact.  There is nothing wrong in having this explained to Opposition spokespeople so that in the limited time available for this Bill we can engage in genuine discussion.  That is a democratic proposal and if the Minister has any interest in building consensus he will concur with this reasonable request from the Opposition.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	113	All of those points can be made on Second Stage of the Bill next week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Minister will provide a briefing to the Members opposite.  I have never seen him not facilitating his colleagues in that way.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	115	In view of the enormous damage done to businesses and households in Cork city and county, does the Government intend to set up a public inquiry into the issues and events before and during the flooding of the city?  A public inquiry is needed to get at the truth and I support the call by my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	That matter could be considered for the Adjournment next week.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	117	In light of the new health policy announced by Deputy Healy-Rae whereby the Government is now building small hospitals, when will the Minister introduce the health information Bill so we can find out the truth about what is happening in the health service?  Those of us having our services removed feel very aggrieved that Deputy Healy-Rae has such power.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	118	That legislation will be introduced next year.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I have contacted the Ceann Comhairle's office on three occasions in the past four weeks asking for time to speak on very important issues — the pre-budget document issued by the Department of Finance, the Adoption Bill and this morning I contacted the Ceann Comhairle's office asking for time to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill.  On each occasion the Ceann Comhairle has not been in a position to facilitate me.I wish to ask the Tánaiste and the Whips of all parties if there is any possibility that those who are not aligned to any party could occasionally express their views and the opinions of those they represent when it comes to issues of national importance.  It is not too much to ask.  We have a constitutional right to be heard in this Chamber.  I do not make a fuss about this every time.  I have been courteous to the Ceann Comhairle and I will continue to be.Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Finian McGrath and I have a right to speak on these issues and I am now asking for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill before Second Stage finishes and to speak on the legislation that will be dealt with next week.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I would be happy to accommodate Deputy Behan or any other independent Member who does not get speaking time.  When the Government guillotines a Bill, however, it is difficult.  Only three members of the Labour Party got in on the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill, and that was done by sharing time.  There was no time to give to people, that is the difficulty we have.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We are anxious to see Deputies accommodated.  We will look at this.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	122	What progress has been made with the preparation of the landlord and tenant Bill?  Publication is expected but we were previously told work was ongoing.  What progress has been made?The Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 appears to have been parked.  It was the subject of discussions between two or three Departments and the Attorney General.  To what extent have the discussions taken place and where does the Bill stand?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The first Bill will be introduced next year while the other Bill is still before the Seanad.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	124	That was not the question.  I asked if the issues being discussed by the Department and the Attorney General had been resolved.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	125	It seems to me that is a detail——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	126	It is a very important Bill to many people.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I will revert to the Deputy.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	128	What is the present position regarding the Competition Authority (amendment) Bill which is one of the Bills that has been promised and in particular the amendment of section 4?  Related to this in another sense in terms of ordering business, I ask for a timescale for the legislation promised in the social partnership agreement, for example, the trade union recognition Bill.  I am asking about the timescale for the legislation that was agreed with the social partners.  It is a list of Bills.  It is a part of the agreement.  I am asking specifically because we will find ourselves either in the courts or whatever, as different bodies negotiate with Government regarding the amendment to section 4 of the Competition Authority legislation.  I have asked for this on numerous occasions but at this stage we should be in a position to know precise information on that legislation and when it will come before the House.  We need to know the status of the other Bills.  Are they now dead or does the Government perhaps intend as a gesture to bring forward all this legislation?  This is very basic legislation, some of it arising in the context of the Lisbon treaty.  When will we have this legislation?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	129	It is my intention to bring the competition authority legislation to the House for consideration at the beginning of next year.  It is my intention and that of the Minister of State to proceed with the agreed Bills arising from Towards 2016.  I know the Deputy has a particular interest in one or two items on that agenda and it is my intention to proceed with them next year.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Can the House be assured that the advice of the Attorney General has been obtained with regard to the legality of section 11 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2009, and with respect to section 29 of the contract held by participating dentists and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, which requires that three months' written notice of termination be issued? We do not want to find ourselves in the same situation with the dentists as we did with the Minister for Health and Children paying out legal fees of nearly €70 million in compensation to pharmacists.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The Attorney General always considers legislation brought before Cabinet.  He has given his advice.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	132	It is very thin in this case.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Will the Government honour the three months' written notice as per the contract?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	134	That is really a matter for the line Minister.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	135	It is very important.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	136	That is the point about rushed legislation; there is no opportunity to consider it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	137	It is a matter for the line Department.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is visiting the House today, has promised he would introduce legislation to put a cap on the amount of waste which could be incinerated in an incinerator.  As a result he believes he will be able to stop the planned incinerator in Ringsend.  Is the environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which is listed for publication the Bill in which the cap on the amount of waste to be incinerated will be included?  When will that Bill be published and will the incinerator be built before it is published?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Watch this space.  No advice from the Minister over there.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Arising from reports on waste management some redrafting is required on the environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  It will be published in mid-January.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	141	As the House is graced with the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, may I ask if he plans to introduce legislation to allow for a shared equity purchase scheme for homeowners, either new or existing, notwithstanding the fact that the Government rejected a Fine Gael proposal in the NAMA Bill for a home protection bond which would have allowed this flexibility?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Is there promised legislation in this area?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I do not see it on the list and this is the reason for my question.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	144	We are dealing with the Order of Business and promised legislation.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I understand that but it is not too often the House is graced with the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the Order of Business.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The Minister is thinking about it at the moment.  He is deep in thought.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Minister is not even listening.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Those issues are matters for the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and I will ask him to revert to the Deputy.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Ceann Comhairle, I am certain I had my hand up to speak.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	150	My apologies, Deputy.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The Ceann Comhairle seems to have a blind spot about this bench.As the only Labour Party speaker with any time remaining which is three minutes, I would gladly give two minutes to Deputy Joe Behan.  He is one of the very few really Independent voices in the House that cannot be bought by the price of a hospital which has already been announced by the Minister for Health and Children.The Tánaiste may be able to assist me.  I have been trying to find the anti-poverty strategy in this budget.  Since I came into this House all budgets have been poverty-proofed.  Last year's Budget Statement contained an annexe B which showed the effect of the budget on the poor and on poverty.  I cannot find this information anywhere in the documentation.  The Minister for Finance stated that he would be helpful to the Opposition so maybe he could assist me and tell where it is or do the poor just not matter any more to this Government?

There has always been a poverty-proofing of the budget.  This used to be done by the Combat Poverty Agency which the Government abolished last year and we were told it would be done instead by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Has this document been laid before the House?  It is a document related to the budget.  Deputy O'Sullivan is correct that it is a statutory obligation——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	167	It is not a statutory obligation.  My understanding is the Minister simply circulates it.

The social welfare Bill is being guillotined this evening but the document on the impact of the budgetary measures on poor people seems to me to be a document which the House needs to have before the debate on the social welfare Bill concludes.  As the Ceann Comhairle has acknowledged, it has not been circulated.  Where is it; when will we have it?  Has it been laid before the House or will it be laid before the House?  Is it the case, as Deputy O'Sullivan has rightly identified, that the Government has not given a second thought to poor people in this country when preparing this budget?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Deputy O'Sullivan is due to speak on the Bill.

If the Ceann Comhairle wants to depart from that practice I suggest he would be creating a very strange precedent.  It has always been the case that where documents are not delivered along with the major legislation, they are made available in the Oireachtas Library, even supporting documents.  If it is the Government's intention to depart from that norm, let us hear it from them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The Deputy will be able to make those points when the debate resumes.

Frankly and between ourselves, I know the distinction between reading a document and speaking in the House.  I have no difficulty in either direction.  If it is to be in the Oireachtas Library, is it circulated?  Will it be circulated?  Is it being dropped?  We just need an answer.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	186	This is very simple.  There has been a requirement and it is the custom year in, year out, that when the Government draws up the budget there is examination of the impact of the budgetary measures on poor people.  This examination used to be done by the Combat Poverty Agency, which no longer exists, and is now supposed to be done by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, in previous years the document was always circulated with the budgetary information.  The budgetary documents provided an assessment which indicated that various measures had been examined and set out their impact on the poor.  This document has not been circulated and what the Labour Party wants to establish before we proceed with the rest of the debate on the social welfare Bill is where is the document.  Alternatively, is it the case that the Government has introduced a budget which impacts on poor people without even assessing this impact?  Is that the position?  Where is the document?  We want it.

These measures are impacting on people who are poor and an assessment was supposed to have been done on the impact of the budget on the poor.  I have some straightforward questions.  Has the assessment been done and is there a document?  If so, where is the document and will it be laid before the House today?  The debate on the social welfare Bill finishes today.

That is the Government's choice, not the choice of the Labour Party.  There is a requirement to have the impact of the budgetary measures on poor people laid before the House.  Where is the document?  Did the Government do an assessment of the impact of the budget on poor people and, if so, when will it be laid before the House?

Did the Government do an assessment?  It is becoming patently clear that the silent Ministers on the front bench, including the Minister for Finance who introduced the budget — the silver spoon wing of the Government — did not examine its impact on poor people.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	231	It is a privilege to present to the House this, the third annual carbon budget.  Since this process commenced two years ago, the carbon budget has continued to evolve and climate change is now very much at the heart of the Government's budgetary policy and decision making.This carbon budget comes at a crucial time not only for Ireland but for humanity in terms of our efforts to tackle climate change.  The next seven days will be a make or break period as the nations of the world gather in Copenhagen in an effort to reach a political deal on climate change, one which we all hope will lead to an early, legally binding international treaty.  The science demands action, the economics support it and future generations depend on it.We must strive to address one of humanity's greatest challenges in limiting and adapting to climate change.  Failure to do so could have catastrophic consequences.  A global deal on climate change is not only necessary for other countries, it is also vital for Ireland.  At home we have seen the loss and suffering scores of families endured during the recent flooding.  I have seen this at first hand.  While we must not infer too much from once off events, these floods are in line with the scientific predictions of the impacts of climate change in Ireland.  The clear lesson from this is that if we do not prepare properly for the climate change impacts that are already occurring and will intensify over the next number of decades, the long-term costs to the Exchequer and society in general will be immense.To the scores of families who have been inundated with flood waters and the huge physical and emotional toll that comes with this, we have offered urgent assistance in the form of €70 million for flood relief and humanitarian assistance, as provided in budget 2010.  We must also learn hard lessons from what has taken place.  The questionable nature of some development decisions in the past could not have been more clearly demonstrated.  We must stop putting residential developments in flood plains and ensure that a climate change impact assessment is taken into consideration in all planning decision making.  This will be done through my new planning Bill.It is also a time of great economic challenge and in budget 2010 the Government has faced up to the significant challenges we face as a country and outlined our strategy for addressing the fiscal deficit and restoring stability and growth to the economy.  The Government took some tough decisions and made some difficult choices but did so in the interests of the entire country, its citizens and their long-term future.  The challenges of climate change and of moving to a low carbon society are equal to that of economic recovery.  Further, they are intrinsically linked to our future economic well-being.  Reducing our emissions will involve difficult choices and difficult decisions, but the benefits of a low carbon, competitive economy and society will greatly outweigh the costs.We will not achieve this aim overnight but the decisions we make now on emission reductions will have benefits for decades to come.  As the action group on green enterprise reported recently, moving to a low carbon society will create upwards of 80,000 jobs during the coming decade.  The report advocates the establishment of a green IFSC, international financial services centre, and I met the promoters of this concept last Friday.  The Green Party in Government will move on this measure.  We will also act to introduce a green procurement system for the public sector, which will drive this sector.This year we are laying two of the cornerstones of Ireland's efforts on climate change.  They will shape and drive the national effort in the years ahead.  The first is the carbon levy, announced on Wednesday by the Minister for Finance.  Today, I am publishing details of the second cornerstone, a framework for the climate change Bill 2010, which outlines the key provisions to be included in the new legislation.No tax has been subjected to the level of consideration and economic analysis as the carbon levy.  It is finally here even if it is long overdue, as I stated in the House on Wednesday.  It is something my colleagues and I in Government have been pushing for many years in this House.  As a principle, it is broadly accepted by most economists and analysts as the most cost efficient way to reduce emissions and its introduction is a landmark step in integrating climate change into the annual fiscal budgetary process.The rationale behind the carbon levy is to change the relative price of fuels based on CO2 emissions to change consumption patterns, encourage fuel efficiency and to lead to an improvement in environment quality.  The benefits of such a tax have been outlined in the report of the Commission on Taxation.  In my contribution to the budget debate yesterday I emphasised the importance of putting a price on carbon which will raise revenue that can be channelled into making our economy and society more energy efficient.  The introduction of the carbon levy is central to our continued efforts to move towards a low-carbon economy.  It is part of a gradual and expanding process.  In previous budgets we took steps to tailor our vehicle registrations tax and motor tax to provide people with the choice to help the environment and to take greater account of CO2 emissions.The carbon levy will have an impact on the various domestic fuels used in Ireland.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance provided details of the phasing in of the tax in various fuel categories.  The yield from carbon levy for all energy products is expected to be €250 million in 2010 and €330 million in a full year.  We will channel this money to make the country more energy efficient and to boost the economy and employment.We will use €130 million to retrofit homes throughout the country.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will launch a national retrofit programme in 2010 with a budget of €90 million, of which €36 million will be ring-fenced for retrofitting households in energy poverty.  This represents more than double the allocation for the same measures in 2009 and a seven-fold increase on the 2008 allocation.  My Department will launch a €40 million retrofit programme for social housing, which I will outline in detail later.  This money will have the effect of greatly improving comfort levels, protecting the health of the occupants as well as reducing the carbon footprint of thousands of households throughout the country.  It will also create and sustain in excess of 6,000 jobs in the construction sector.  As a result of the revenue from the carbon levy the Government has been able to provide a PRSI exemption of €36 million for employers who take unemployed people off the dole.  It has also enabled us to reduce our VAT levels.I refer to the effects on emissions.  The carbon levy will reduce emissions in the non-traded sectors of the economy by 750,000 tonnes between now and the end of 2012.  This will result in an average reduction of 150,000 tonnes per annum between 2008 and 2012 or 250,000 tonnes in a full year.The transport sector will be impacted more than any other sector due to the importance of the relative price difference between Ireland and the UK.  The Government has published a new transport policy, Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future.  It sets out a clear path to significantly reducing emissions in the transport sector by 2020.  Smarter Travel will promote a more sustainable transport system that encourages more active modes of travel, improving local towns and community space, reducing congestion and delivering significant health benefits.Similarly, the renewed programme for Government emphasises the importance of investment in public transport and by incentivising behavioural change it will deliver a more sustainable transport future for everyone.  This emphasis has been seen very clearly in this year's budget.  Despite the very difficult financial backdrop, key public transport services are being continued to ensure continued enhancement of rail services, especially to support commuters and to give increased priority to buses in Dublin and other cities.  The completion dates and appropriate road standards of the remaining 94 road projects at the design stage or at an earlier level of development will be reviewed in light of the economic circumstances, falling road usage and our climate change objectives.Changes in other sectors will be more gradual.  Investment in more efficient capital stock will be strongly incentivised by carbon taxes.  However, these changes will take place over a longer timeframe than one year.  It will take time for a carbon levy to have its full impact on behaviour but we now have a very positive starting point.The second pillar of our ambitious approach to climate change is the proposed over-arching climate change Bill which I will introduce in 2010.  I have circulated a document entitled A Framework for the Climate Change Bill 2010, which outlines the key provisions on which the heads of the Bill will be based.  I emphasise that work on the heads of the Bill continues apace and I hope to be in a position to publish the heads before the end of the first quarter in 2010.This legislation marks a key milestone in the battle against climate change and the legislative proposals contained in the document will shape and drive our efforts in tackling this core national priority.  These provisions are a mark of our intent and ambition in this area and include enshrining for the first time in national primary legislation key policies and principles which will guide and drive our climate change agenda in the future.For the first time it will set ambitious statutory targets including a 3% average annual reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in the programme for Government, but to be extended to 2020 and an 80% reduction of 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Enabling provisions will be included to allow these targets to be amended following the advice of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and in line with the evolution of scientific knowledge and international commitments.  The legislation will place the national climate change strategy on a statutory basis, on the basis of a five year cycle with the first two strategies due to run from 2011 to 2015 and 2016 to 2020.  It will place the carbon budget process on a statutory basis, based on the multi-annual approach as outlined in the national climate change strategy.  It will also place the national climate change adaptation strategy on a statutory basis following its publication next year.  It will establish a high level group of experts under a climate change committee which will be supported by a new office of climate change to be located in the EPA and it will develop a system of monitoring and reporting which will impose statutory obligations on Departments and public bodies.This legislation will be the cornerstone of our efforts to meet ever more demanding national and international obligations post the Kyoto Agreement.  Analysis of the latest greenhouse gas emissions data which has now been produced by the Environmental Protection Agency and developments in other relevant areas relating to the carbon budget are set out for Deputies in an appendix to this statement.  I have also circulated tables showing the key measures introduced by the Government since 2007 and an updated table setting out the trend in greenhouse gas emissions based on provisional estimates for 2008.The colder winter of 2008 led to a rise of 8.7% in emissions in the residential sector from 2007.  While gross emissions fell slightly, the figures show that the deceleration of emissions due to contraction of the economy may not be moving as quickly as had been anticipated.  We must bear in mind that 2008 is the first year of the Kyoto Agreement period and we still expect this deceleration to continue until 2010.  Any such trend serves to underpin and underline the need to intensify our response to dealing with our emissions and to achieve the reductions so desperately needed.  It also underscores the importance of moving ahead with the two headline initiatives represented by the carbon levy and the climate change Bill.All social housing will be required to meet more exacting standards of energy performance and it is important to ensure that the tradition of high quality construction standards in public housing continues and that new social housing construction is at the forefront of our efforts to move to the next level of energy efficiency standards.  This year, I approved eight Towards Carbon Neutral demonstration projects, which will go beyond even the proposed 2010 standards, delivering a minimum building energy rating, BER, of A2.  A total of €20 million is being set aside over the next two years to support projects in this area and I will seek to ensure that the learning derived from those projects will be mainstreamed into the social housing construction programme generally.The scale of the existing public housing stock, at approximately 145,000 units, and the varying levels of performance within that overall stock, demand that we seek to deliver significant energy efficiency improvements here also.  In recent years, we have made considerable strides in this area through the impact of significant remedial works and regeneration programmes.I propose to expand our involvement in this area and therefore I have earmarked €20 million within the 2009 social housing investment programme to commence work on an energy efficiency retrofitting programme for local authority housing stock, generally seeking to achieve C1 building energy rating.  The importance I attach to activities in this area is underlined by the fact that funding for energy efficiency measures in the public housing stock will increase significantly next year, with more than €40 million being provided.  In parallel, the Department is developing a ten-year strategy with the objective of achieving the full retrofitting of social housing stock.  That strategy is to be completed in the first half of next year and will provide a road map for the delivery of the programme over the next decade.The retrofitting strategy will also be informed by a comprehensive review of the condition of public housing stock.  This national house condition survey is designed to examine, among other issues, the age and condition of the dwelling, its energy rating and the type and extent of central heating, insulation and other efficiency characteristics.  The survey is being carried out in a number of phases.  Phase one, involving a review of the relevant information currently held by local authorities, is already complete and the planning for subsequent phases is under way with a view to commencing phase two early next year.I regret that I do not have more time as there are many initiatives I wished to outline.  With the carbon levy and the climate change Bill we are setting out our stall in terms of our ambition as a nation to combat climate change.  We are sending out a message to people here and beyond our shores of our intent, determination, and sense of purpose in tackling climate change.  It is a message I am proud to take to Copenhagen.

I hope the expectations that have been rather managed, a bit like the budget, will be more successful in Copenhagen than they have been in the budget.I wish to dwell on one aspect in the time allowed.  Fine Gael supports a low carbon society but we believe we should be in a position to make greater strides in our objectives than has been the case to date.  The 3% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that was part of the programme for Government in 2007 is clearly not being met and the target has now been extended to 2020 to cover some of the blushes on those matters.  Our party has published a radical document that would help the Minister to achieve those objectives if he could get the Government's support for doing so.The climate change agenda should be an opportunity for the country.  In addition to meeting our greenhouse gas emissions targets, it should provide an economic and employment stimulus.  The Fine Gael document, New Era, which the Minister has read, is a clear set of proposals that would assist him to provide jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  I regret that the budget tinkers around the edges of climate change matters.  I welcome the retrofit scheme but I do not see any major imprimatur for green technology proposals that have been outlined in our document.  A low carbon economy is an opportunity for a competitive economy.  Those countries that can make themselves more environmentally sustainable will have the edge over others.The Government's record on transforming the economy into a low carbon economy has not had its objectives met with any degree of success to date.  Recent reductions in emission have only been achieved because of a reduction in our national output.  I note that some of the Minister's spokespersons and statements have been indicating that to reduce the national herd would make a major contribution to reducing our agricultural emissions.  I do not see any similar impetus being made in terms of implementing Deputy Coveney's proposal on electric vehicles.  The Minister did not refer to it in his speech.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	236	We would like to hear more about it.  The Fine Gael stimulus plan would make a significant difference in terms of reducing this country's greenhouse gas output.  As a response to the environmental and economic challenges we face, we have published a plan to transform the economy into a modern, sustainable and clean one.  Our New Era strategy is the first major credible step in transforming the economy into a low carbon one and creating 100,000 jobs.  The €11 billion investment programme off-balance sheet will see significant State intervention to rapidly provide more sustainable energy and transport sectors while bringing telecommunications into the 21st century.  That radical transformation will dramatically reduce emissions from the energy and transport sectors.Appendix 2 of the carbon budget statement makes clear that the Minister has ignored some of the proposals suggested to him on the matter.  We import €6 billion worth of fossil fuels every year to feed our cars, homes and electricity grid.  That is neither economically nor environmentally sustainable.  The €6 billion of imported fossil fuel also represents 64.7% of all emissions in this country created from fossil fuel combustion.  Some radical suggestions have been put forward by this party to assist him in meeting our national objectives.  The Minister is setting up committees and he is one step away from making major decisions, yet he is tinkering around the edges of achieving our national objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Actions speak louder than words.  The all-party committee chaired by my colleague, Deputy Barrett, has many suggestions to make to the Minister to assist him in meeting those objectives much more quickly than he has to date.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Even in the heat of the budget debate it makes sense to have set time aside to talk about the carbon budget, which is a welcome new element to the budget debate.The debate we had on Thursday evening on the introduction of a carbon tax or carbon levy was an embarrassment to this House.  It turned into a Punch and Judy show and a slagging match, which I was embarrassed about.  It is unfortunate that when we are introducing something as significant as a new carbon levy, a carbon tax for the first time, we had such a debate.It is also unfortunate that when my party has genuine concerns about the way in which this new tax is being implemented that those concerns were dismissed on the supposed understanding that Fine Gael wants to play politics with the issue or does not understand it.  I found that very frustrating also.We have published our views on climate change.  As I indicated on Wednesday night, we proposed a higher carbon value, but we had also proposed that there would be certain exemptions for good reason considering the current state of the economy.  We now have a really unacceptable dichotomy, whereby we will charge consumers a carbon charge for using fossil fuels, for good reason.  We are continuing not only to allow energy generators to use carbon-based fuels with no charge to them, but on top of that we are requiring them to charge consumers for something that is costing them nothing and attaching a carbon element to electricity charges.  That is the major objection I have to our carbon charging strategy.Consumers are paying on the double and large energy generating companies are making windfall profits on the back of that to the tune of €220 million last year with the exception of the ESB, which gave some money back in a different way.  That must change.  We have a pool of money here.  If there were a tax on windfall profits made on the back of consumers, we could use it as a carbon fund to do all sorts of other things on top of what the Minister proposes.  The Minister seems to refuse to consider that and dismisses the issue as if it is not a valid one.  I cannot understand that, given he is someone who has a genuine concern in regard to carbon management.I refer to forestry.  The one thing on which anyone who is concerned about carbon management, carbon reduction and creating carbon sinks must agree is that we must take a more aggressive and proactive approach to planting trees, or afforestation.  This issue was painted in the budget in a way that suggested the Government will allocate an extra €121 million for afforestation next year.  This year we spent €119 million.  The Government said that next year, we will plant 7,000 hectares when we have not even hit 5,000 this year.  I do not see how the sums add up.Planting trees not only makes sense for the environment but it is also very labour intensive.  I appeal to the Minister to try to increase the priority of forestry.  In the national climate change strategy, to which we are supposed to be operating, there is an aspiration that 15,000 hectares of trees will be planted annually.  The programme for Government states 10,000 hectares.  Next year we aspire to planting 7,000 hectares but the sums do not add up.I appeal to the Minister to consider the two issues I raise, in particular the windfall profits tax.  Consumers are getting hit on the double.  A pool of money which we could use as a carbon fund is being pocketed by energy generators on a windfall profits basis.  That is no longer acceptable, in particular in the context of introducing a new carbon charge for fossil fuels.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	238	My understanding, and that of the public, was that all moneys collected from the carbon levy would be used for the purpose of reducing CO2 emissions.  The Minister only mentions €130 million to retrofit homes.  I got the impression from the Minister’s Budget Statement that this fund has already been raided by the Department of Finance.  He stated clearly that some of the money will be used for purposes other than for what this carbon levy is supposed to be for.  If we are to sell this principle to the public, I would like an assurance that this levy and the moneys from it will be ring-fenced and that a clear statement will be made each year on how much and exactly where it was spent and that at the end of the year, when presenting the carbon budget for the following year, the Minister will report how exactly the money was spent in the previous year.  The Department of Finance should not be allowed to touch this money if it is called a carbon levy.  My committee and I will support any effort the Minister requires to ensure this does not happen.  I strongly suggest that there be a provision in his climate change Bill stating that all moneys raised from a carbon levy will be used for that purpose and, therefore, it will have a statutory basis.  Let us get off on the right foot.Our committee has endeavoured to approach this topic on an all-party basis, which has worked to date.  I hope that will continue.  I am pleased the Minister is proceeding with the climate change Bill.  As he knows, we produced the heads of a Bill.  I hope the heads of his Bill will be debated at our committee and that together, we may be able to produce something which will achieve all-party support.Another matter about which I am concerned is all this smart this and smart that, including smart transport.  The reality is the Department of Transport has done absolutely nothing to show any progress on the way public transport is provided.  We do not have one bus or one local authority vehicle displaying a sign stating that it is run by renewable energy.  We have an infrastructural deficit in terms of our public transport.In regard to the capital programme, will somebody realise the potential of upgrading our grid as a matter of urgency?  We should stop fooling around trying to decide what to do on this issue.  As the Minister well knows, building a grid is vital infrastructure to enable us to transform the means by which public transport and everything else could be run.I refer to the interconnection to the super grid that will be developed in Europe and through which Ireland could avail of an export market.  If we do not prepare the ground now, we will not be in a position to gain access to the grid for those who want to invest in renewable energy, whether ocean energy, onshore wind energy or otherwise.  This is a real problem for investors.I urge the Government to plough the money into the infrastructure that is necessary for what would be a major export business for Irish green energy in the future.  Let us put aside the nice ideas we have about undergrounds and so on and get on with providing a grid that will enable people to access it in order that we can really transform the manner in which we produce our electricity.As Deputy Hogan stated, we import fossil fuels at tremendous cost to this State.  Oil prices will increase.  We are aware we have peak oil.  The minute oil prices increase, it will be detrimental to this country.  The sooner we develop our own source of energy, the better.  One cannot do that without the infrastructure.  We found that with rail, road, etc.  I appeal to the Government to realise the potential there and to invest the money.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	There was a slight drop in emissions in 2008.  Transport emissions are down by just under 1%, energy emissions have grown slightly and agricultural emissions have fallen due to lower cattle and sheep numbers.  The other reduction relates to carbon sinks.  Carbon sinks represent net afforestation since 1990 so that has allowed us to reduce our carbon emissions further.  Nothing the Government has done has brought about that reduction.  The falls in emissions are not due to acts by the Government but are largely due to the recession.This is the third carbon budget and each year there is a headline stating so many tonnes of carbon will be saved because of it.  With the third carbon budget, the reduction in emissions is thanks in the main to the recession.  Carbons sinks also save the Government slightly.  However, there is little for the Government to show for positive action to improve our environment and reduce emissions.  This is against gains arising from people not being able to go to work because they have lost their job and are not driving, for example.I presume we will have to pay for carbon credits for 2008 so will the Minister clarify how many tonnes will we have to buy and at what cost?  Each year the carbon budget has had a headliner.  In the first year it was energy-efficient light bulbs.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I never opposed the measure.  I just pointed out that it would not be possible for the Minister to implement it and I was right.  The Minister had to wait for action from Europe and 100-watt bulbs have only been phased out this year.  It will take years to complete the measure.  There was never a big figure amounting to hundreds of tonnes saved because of the banning of incandescent light bulbs.  The headline from the first carbon budget never happened.  Last year it was 2020 transport, which was very much a damp squib.  The year 2020 is still a good few years away, although the Minister mentioned it again this year.This year the headline is the carbon tax, the climate change Bill and the retrofit schemes.  With the retrofit scheme, the big problem for the Government is that it usually makes a big announcement of so many millions of euro being provided with so many jobs arising from it.  The newspapers write their headline from that but a year later, what will be delivered?  There has been considerable underspend in the greener homes and home energy schemes this year.I cannot presume what will happen by the end of the month but in answer to a question I tabled a week or two ago, I was told the underspend in the greener homes scheme was approximately €5 million.  The underspend looks to be much greater for the home energy scheme, as €47 million was provided but only €13 million was spent at the time of my question.  I could be wrong but I presume this relates to the recession.  Although a grant is provided for a third of the cost of retrofitting a home to make it energy-efficient, people cannot afford to spend what is required because of the recession.  The money provided for Government grants this year has apparently not been spent as a result.  Will there be a similar problem with the retrofitting scheme announced by the Government this year?Some of this goes to local authorities but they may not have the capacity to benefit because they are significantly understaffed.  Authorities have lost 4,000 staff over the past year, mainly temporary staff, and in the budget this year the local government fund has been cut further.  That means more staff will have to be shed by local authorities.  How will such authorities carry out retrofitting or flood relief works if staff numbers are down?The Minister mentioned flooding.  Estimates for flood relief works last year provided €50 million and the 2008 budget provided €50 million.  Some €25 million was spent in 2008 and this year €38 million will be spent.  The pattern has persisted for about ten years where so much flood relief is provided in the budget but not all of it is spent.  A considerable amount has not been spent in the past couple of years.  The Government has stated it will provide €70 million this year but at the end of next year will we find that only half of that has been spent?When the flood policy review group and Goodbody economic consultants considered the matter they found that flood relief money was not being spent because there is not enough staffing to ensure it is spent.  The Government is cutting back on such staff.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, should be picked up on the idea that we should not tax work or labour and that we should instead bring in carbon taxes.  Such taxes are fine in principle but the fairest way to tax people is on their income.  We do not want to go the route of the Progressive Democrat policy over the past 12 years and reduce income taxes further in the next few years.  We must learn from the mistakes we have made.  The Government made a mistake when it reduced income taxes and it brought about more inequality as a result, as identified by ICTU.  Societies and countries which have more equality in income and fairer income tax systems have a better record on climate change.If the Minister really wants to do something about climate change, he should bring about more income equality in Ireland.  This budget is doing the reverse, and it is similar to what the Government has been doing for the past 12 years when the Progressive Democrats controlled matters.  It seems the Green Party will allow this to happen and positively promote such action as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has done lately.The Green Party used to deal with environmental matters but over the past few years the issue has been climate change.  People are now focused on jobs and the economy so the issue has become subdued.  If we want to act on climate change we must protect the environment.  The Minister, in the Budget Statement, has let his Government cut through the environment budget.  That budget covers the Environment Protection Agency etc. and 25% less will be spent under the environment heading.  Some 67% less is to be spent on waste management, which is very important in the reduction of emissions.  We must ensure people do not send rubbish to landfill or incinerate it.  The local government fund has been cut by 12%.  The grants for heritage and planning are being reduced in a similar way.There are headlines about climate change and announcements by Ministers in press conferences.  If the Green Party is to do its job in government, it should look to protect our environment.  That is where it is falling down, which is not helping with the climate change agenda.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I thank Deputy Tuffy for affording me some time.  It is welcome that we are having this debate and it is good that the carbon budget has been introduced to this House.  It smacks of tokenism when one Minister is present in the House when the big task facing this Government and those following it will be tackling climate change.  Departments that have a direct responsibility are not being represented.  The Ministers for Transport; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are not here.  The Taoiseach should be here as well.Unless we have a significant shift in the Government on the issue we will not reach our targets.  We will have debates, point out matters and have agreements and disagreements but it will not happen.  The Greens used to use the term "transformational approach" and that is what we need.  This is not it.I welcome the publication of the Bill's framework and there are some good parts to it.  I welcome that there will be a climate change committee which will draw on expertise and that fuel poverty has been mentioned, as it is central to how we approach the issue.  The problem lies in the political sphere; this is about leadership and management.  I cannot find within the framework document any indication that the lesson has been learned.Responsibility will still lie with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but he or she is just one Minister.  The big problem is that the Minister will not have authority over other Departments.  The structure that all the parties on the joint Oireachtas committee support is the idea of a transformational piece of legislation where the Taoiseach will take charge and manage the project in a coherent way.I hope it is not the case but there seems to be a real danger that the Minister feels this is his area and he must hold on to it no matter what.  That is not the way of the world anymore.  I will never take from the Green Party its role as a pioneer in this area but this country will not play its part internationally unless we transform the way we govern ourselves regarding climate change.  This is not set out in the framework Bill and that must be addressed.  I would love it to be otherwise, but it will not happen.No Member, including the Minister, has had enough time to make his or her contribution, even though this is a central political issue, and this also needs to be addressed.  The figures in the appendix to the carbon budget are valuable.  Carbon emissions were expected to reduce because of the recession but that has not happened to the extent anticipated, which is a pity because we have to deal with the issue.  However, the central issue is how we transform our society across the board to ensure we have a low carbon economy whether Ireland is experiencing growth or a recession.  I have great concerns, having only given the document a cursory glance, about the revised projection for gross emissions between 2008 and 2012 because it is way in excess of our emissions in 1990.  This reflects myopia, a lack of confidence and a failure to grasp the core issue if we are to make the transformation we need.The problem does not lie with Fianna Fáil.  There is a readiness, which may not come naturally, that was not present previously in the larger party, to grasp the nettle but the Green Party is not pushing.  The Green Party used to push all of us, which was great, but it has given up pushing and has settled for second best.  I wish I did not have to say this because we must work together to meet this challenge but the proposed Bill is more of the same.  I welcome wholeheartedly the few changes it provides for but in terms of political management and administration and turning the tanker around, whether it is in the difficult sectors such as transport, agriculture, enterprise and even education, a different structure and new form of governance are needed which we have not had previously.  However, we have partially applied different structures to meet major challenges such as that in Northern Ireland in the past.  I urge the Minister to have courage regarding what must be done because he will have support from every party if he demonstrates the necessary courage to bring about that transformation.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The context of this debate is the Copenhagen summit which is taking place this week.  Climate change and, more fundamentally, adverse weather conditions, are among the issues of immediate concern in Ireland in the light of the impact of the recent floods and concerns we are witnessing different and unusual patterns of rainfall that reflect global changes.  Different agendas will be pushed in Copenhagen — some for selfish national reasons — but, hopefully, the hopes of ordinary people will prevail.  That is why it is vital that the summit reaches a legally binding deal, which is strong enough to tackle the challenge of climate change while being just and fair to developing countries.Different interests are at stake.  For developed countries, which by and large no longer depend greatly on manufacturing industry, many of targets revolve around reducing emissions from heavy industry.  For many developing countries, including some that have experienced significant industrial growth over recent decades, this is regarded as presenting a threat to their future development.  Striking a balance between the two, which has the best interests of the world's population at its centre, will not be easy, but it must be done.  There is also the onus on the developed Western countries to set and implement binding effective targets for emission reductions, to develop new cleaner technologies in order that developing countries are not left to carry the main burden for the negative impact earlier Western and northern hemisphere industrialisation and use of carbon fuels has had.The problem of climate change must also be approached in a positive manner in order that moving away from older manufacturing systems based on the heavy use of carbon fuels is not seen as an inhibitor to economic growth but as an opportunity to boost the use of newer and cleaner technologies, which do not present the same threat to the environment and which are more sustainable both in terms of the environment and future economic growth.  The key to this will be the greater utilisation of renewable energy, which will not only have radical implications for the industrial economy but also for agriculture, with the potential for the greatly increased production of energy crops, and for an entirely new economic sector based on the production of energy from the wind and sea.  The potential for Ireland, as an island nation, is a huge benefit that must not be lost.The Government claims that by introducing a carbon tax it will be on board with the thinking outlined internationally.  If carbon tax is to work effectively, it should be revenue neutral whereas the measure introduced in the budget is another means to increase revenue and, in common with most of the other measures implemented, it falls disproportionately on people who are feeling the impact of the current austerity programme.  It has been argued by experts in the field that an effective carbon tax, which would reduce the use of carbon fuels, would also reduce revenue from that source as logically as if it was a success, the use of carbon fuels in the transport sector would fall.The Green Party may claim its introduction fulfils part of its commitment to having the Government implement measures to protect the environment and to attain the ambitious targets set for the reduction in CO2 emissions but there is little in it that will tackle the underlying causes.  Instead, it will impose an added burden of taxation and will in no way help to change patterns of transport and overall fuel use.  For example, nothing in the manner in which it will be implemented will encourage people to use public transport rather than their own cars.  That has been pointed out by representatives of the bus sector who have made the valid point that if the Government was serious about encouraging a significant shift to the use of the bus sector, it would not have imposed this tax on buses.The other issue is that the tax will increase the level of fuel poverty.  Imposing the tax on users of home heating oil, coal and peat will mean an added cost to household budgets, which will mean that more people will be unable to keep their homes adequately heated.  This, in turn, will lead to health problems which will lead to an increased burden on the health services.The Minister for Finance claimed that the increase in fuel poverty will be offset by a voucher system that will facilitate the application of an allowance and also that more will be invested in the effort to make homes more energy efficient and, therefore, reduce the cost of heating homes.  Surely that programme ought to have been made a greater priority before this and measures put into place to ensure all houses built over the past period were compliant rather than throwing it in now as an afterthought due to the fact that the Minister knows that applying the carbon tax to home heating oil will increase fuel poverty, as he has recognised.He also claimed that revenue from the carbon tax will be partly used to support rural transport, which is disingenuous, given rural transport is under severe constraints from cutbacks to services.  The moves afoot to significantly reduce the availability of buses in rural areas will offset any likely shift away from private car use if for no other reason than that even if people did wish to do, the service either will be no longer available or has been significantly reduced.That is not to say there is not a serious issue to be addressed here.  The level of emissions needs to be reduced.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, this State has committed not to allow CO2  emissions rise more than 13% above their 1990 level.  Currently it is 23% above the agreed target.  Not merely does this leave us in breach of our international obligations, it renders us liable to annual fines of up to €180 million.  This accelerates the necessity for us to live up to our obligations.Kyoto marked only the first step in tackling global warming.  Experts estimate that carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by between 80% and 90% by 2050 if run-away climate change is to be avoided.  We have not merely a moral obligation to future generations to prevent global warming; it makes economic sense.  The Stern review found clear evidence that it is cheaper to take the necessary measures to prevent climate change now than to deal with the consequences later.Climate change is not the only reason, however, to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  World oil supplies are getting harder to access and are concentrated in a reduced number of geopolitically unstable nations.  There is still lots of oil in the ground, but it is getting tougher to find and more expensive to extract.  Meanwhile the growth of the Asian economies continues to increase global demand for energy.  Estimates of the date of peak oil — the point at which global supplies will top out before entering decline — range from now until 2020 or later.  However, there is a growing consensus that we are entering an era of permanently higher energy prices.  As a country that imports 90% of its energy, situated at the very end of extended supply lines from the Middle East and Eastern Europe, Ireland is uniquely vulnerable.  This is all the more reason we should now invest in clean, sustainable energy.Dealing with the twin challenges of climate change and peak oil requires us to begin reducing our fossil fuel usage and developing alternative sources of energy.  This can be achieved by putting a price on carbon emissions, which will drive up the price of fossil fuels to reflect their environmental costs while making renewable energy more competitive.  However, this again is something that would discriminate against the most vulnerable in society.An alternative to a carbon tax such as this might be a personal carbon trading system, whereby the Government would set a national carbon budget, limiting the amount of carbon which could be emitted in a given year, and use it as a basis to allocate emissions credits to individuals.  Every adult would be entitled to the same number of emission credits, which would be held in electronic accounts and used to make carbon-related purchases such as electricity, heating fuel and petrol.  People who wanted an extra carbon allowance would be able to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits.  Conversely, people who did not use all their credits could sell their surplus.  The balance of supply and demand would set the price.  Unlike a carbon tax, personal carbon trading would set a definite limit to the amount of carbon released by the economy in a given year.  Giving everyone an equal number of carbon credits would ensure equity and effectively address the issue of fuel poverty.  Personal carbon trading would be a progressive measure and since the rich use more energy, they would need to buy allowances from the less well off.  In this respect, personal carbon trading is superior to a carbon tax.  However, it would be complex to implement and involve high administration costs.Perhaps the best option would be a cap and share scheme, such as that proposed by the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, Feasta, and supported by Comhar, the Sustainable Development Council of Ireland.  Under cap and share, carbon emissions would be capped at their current level and then reduced rapidly year by year.  Each of us would receive an annual fossil fuel pollution authorisation permit, PAP, conveying the right to our individual share of that year's total emissions and making us responsible for it.  The important thing about these permits is that unlike personal carbon trading, they would not restrain our personal energy use.  Instead, they would permit fossil fuel production.  PAPs would be valid for a year, during which people could sell them to financial intermediaries such as banks and post offices, which in turn would sell them on to oil, coal and gas importers or producers.  These producers would need to acquire enough permits to cover the carbon dioxide emissions from every tonne of fossil fuel they sold.Cap and share has a number of advantages.  Unlike a carbon tax, the fact there is a cap on emissions means a reduction in the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere is guaranteed.

Although the cost of energy and other goods would rise, due to fossil fuel producers having to pay for permits, this would be offset by the money individuals would earn from the sale of their PAPs.  For most people, this would be greater than the increased cost of the energy they used.  Cap and share would operate as a tax or rent on fossil fuel importers and producers, but unlike other environmental taxes, its final impact would be progressive.  Due to the fact cap and share does not regulate individual purchases of carbon by consumers, it is a lot simpler and cheaper to implement than personal carbon trading.

I will be joined there by some of his colleagues, including Deputy Coveney.  I share the regret of others that we have not had more time for this debate.  The carbon budget should be a central issue and should involve as many Ministers as possible.  Ironically, because of Copenhagen, it was not possible to leave our debate on the carbon budget until a week later as originally planned.  However, I hope that we will have a debate on a carbon budget in the context of the forthcoming climate change Bill.  With regard to what Deputy McManus said, I continue to push for a carbon budget because I believe it is as important as the ordinary budget and will become even more important in the years to come.Deputy Coveney spoke about, to use his own words, his own embarrassment about the recent debate on this issue.  I do not doubt his bona fides with regard to the matter, but he and those in the Labour Party should look at some of the statements made by some of their own party members.  I do not believe people on the back benches share their views on climate change.

We have made steady progress.  There has been a 1% annual decrease, but we need to go further.  We need to get on the road to a low carbon trajectory, something that will produce jobs and will provide a better quality of life for our citizens as well.The framework document is radical.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I cannot believe the Government has failed to poverty-proof this budget.  It has been a feature of all budgets since I have been here that the back of the budget document contained an annex on poverty proofing and which explained the effect of the budget on the poorest.  Thankfully, today's newspapers have done it.  For example, The Irish Times notes that the poorest one fifth of families will lose 2.7%, while the richest one fifth will gain 0.5% as a result of this budget.  That is a very good indication of why we did not have a poverty-proofing of this budget, which I believe we were obliged to do.It is quite clear that the Thatcherite approach of this budget has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by the people on the Government benches.  They will march into the lobbies this afternoon.  I appeal to them, and in particular to the so-called Independents who are supporting the Government and who were bought by the price of hospitals and medical facilities that had been already announced, to realise for what they are actually voting.  They will reduce people's income to €196 per week, while the richest of the rich are getting away scot free.  I will now give way to Deputy Behan, who is a true Independent in this House.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank the Labour Party, particularly Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Stagg, for giving me the opportunity to speak for 60 seconds on this Bill.  They have been very generous in offering valuable time, because I know that time for discussion is coming to an end.Deputies McGrath and O'Sullivan have their own distinct opinions, but I think they generally agree with me when I say this is an unfair, unjust and inequitable budget.  The documentation we received outlines the income reductions on many of the poorest people in our society.  As far as I am concerned, it is a charter for injustice.  The Members who support this tonight will have to hang their heads in shame.  Payments such as widows' pensions, carer's benefit, invalidity pension, disability pension, supplementary welfare allowance — the most basic payment for the poor — carer's allowance, disability and blind pension allowance are being cut.  It is unbelievable that Fianna Fáil — a party that always stood for all sectors in society, especially the weakest — would for the first time in its proud history decide to attack the poorest people in our country.  It contrasts vividly with the abject and unconditional surrender to the judges of this country, who are not being asked to make any contribution on a compulsory manner to the difficulties that this nation faces.  That says it all.  On that basis, I will not be supporting this measure tonight.While I am grateful for the minute I received from the Labour Party to speak on this, it is not acceptable that three Members elected by the people to this Chamber should have to grovel and beg to get this time to speak on important issues.  The three Independent Members will continue to fight for our right to speak on issues such as this in the future.

Obviously, they had nothing of value to offer.  I am sorry Deputy Stagg took the view that it would be more appropriate to disrupt than to make a contribution, unlike others in the Labour Party who made very reasonable contributions last night——

It is with a very heavy heart that we come to make recommendations to the social welfare budget.  It is unfortunate that due to the balancing of the books that must happen from the nation's point of view, we must reduce our expenditure.

The choices are not just that we could take in more revenue from a particular group, because that was not going to find us €4 billion.  That was not going to make the changes that we needed for the long term.  We were faced with a situation where every single Department had to make savings.  Within the social welfare budget, there were difficult choices.

In light of the disregards that exist, we are trying to ensure that carers, depending on family circumstances, have the opportunity to work outside the home as well.  We recognise and appreciate these individuals for the work they do.  The same applies in respect of the domiciliary care allowance for parents who have children with special needs.  We did not cut this allowance, even though the people in this group are of working age.  It was important that we did not reduce the rate of this allowance.Some €650 million will be spent on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and the half-rate carer's allowance in 2009.  This compares to an amount of €46 million being spent on them just over ten years ago.  That is a very big contribution.

We could not, for example, have cut the rates paid to carers and not cut those relating to another of the working-age groups.There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to the sensitivities that apply in respect cutting allowances for people with disabilities.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	480	On section 1, I will mention the fact that I tried to amend section 1, the Title to the Bill and how it will be cited as an Act in the future, as the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009.That Title gives no indication of the scale of what this Bill involves.  My attempt to amend the Title was ruled out of order.  I got the Ceann Comhairle's missive, which stated that he regretted to inform me that amendments Nos. 1 and 9, tabled by me for Committee Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill, must be ruled out of order as they are declaratory in nature.  That is ridiculous, they are not declaratory, they are descriptive.  The whole idea is to allow a description of what the Bill intends to achieve.The intention behind the entire Bill is to substantially reduce social welfare.  Not only will it do that but it will lay the groundwork for emigration on a vast scale again, something this Government boasted for ten years that it had eradicated.  Emigration destroyed communities across this country and that is exactly what this Bill will do if and when it is passed.It is my intention to raise the issue that this Bill will substantially reduce social welfare.  I was not being frivolous or declaratory, I was being realistic in what I intended to do, so that this Bill and its odious nature would reflect that in the future.This Bill will substantially reduce social welfare payments to young people and turn them into second class citizens, it will discriminate against them and mean they are not proper citizens who enjoy the same benefits as those over 25.  Where the 25 years came from, I do not know.  I presumed that young people became adults at the age of 18 according to the State but there is a different system.  The Short Title, construction, collective citations and commencements of this Bill should include information to that effect.If I had the time I would have tried to alter the commencement of the Bill to ensure it would not come into effect until the number of unemployed had fallen back to where it was four years ago and that poverty had been reduced to a negligible level.  We did not have that opportunity because this Bill was produced when the Department was burning the midnight oil at a moment's notice.  That can be seen by the fact that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is even, at this stage, trying to introduce amendments.The other point I wanted to make on section 1 but I did not have the luxury of time, is that this Bill should not be coming into operation unless every aspect of is poverty proofed.  Deputy Shortall mentioned the Cabinet handbook instruction that all legislation introduced should be examined to ensure it does not increase the level of poverty.  The level of poverty will substantially increase because of this Bill for the vast majority of people.  There is, however, a small cohort in society who will continue to increase their wealth and who will get away with it scot free.  The taxation system has not been made fair.  That is what we should be addressing.If this Bill addressed the huge wealth that still exists in this country, we might be able to support it but I will not stand here and support any aspect of this Bill because its intention is to screw the people, to rob those who are already poor of the little they have, to take meals from children and to make young people emigrate.It is scandalous what it will do to graduates.  I remember the brain drain in the 1980s, where those who came out of university went away, so the State lost all the investment it made in their education.  That is what will happen again, we will forgo the investment the State has made in education, even though it was not enough.  The young people will leave.  In this Bill, the Government is ensuring those graduates, who started their university education with a career path in mind for when they finish, can no longer follow that path because the jobs are gone and the Government did nothing to protect them or to ensure they would come back.Where will those people go when they finish university?  Straight on to the dole at €100 each.  How will they survive to ensure they are still around if the economy comes out of recession in five or six years' time?  It will be more than five or six years if this Government has anything to do with it because it has no stimulus package to put in place.That was the intention of the amendment and that is why I am objecting to section 1.  This section and the rest of the Bill should be rejected.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I oppose section 1.  It clearly facilitates the proposed cuts to welfare payments for young people, cuts that are totally unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to consider that these young people have been in education for up to five years, they have significant skills and if they cannot go to work, it is not because they do not want to, clearly they do.  They want to get on with their careers, to begin saving and building their lives.  Unfortunately the Government is now telling them they must take a six week course that is probably considerably below their skill levels.We must ask, therefore, what is the motivation behind these proposals.  It is clearly designed to facilitate these young people going abroad.  Internationally, Canada is one of the few places where there might be employment, or indeed Poland.  Any of the other traditional hunting grounds for work for the Irish — Britain, the US, Australia — are all under pressure themselves.The Government is not just guilty in this Bill of forcing young people away from Ireland but of forcing them into further difficulties, something that is completely unacceptable.  The courses on offer are largely short courses in FÁS and I wonder what will be the outcome of its budget cuts with regard to these courses.Young people want to go to work; they do not want to be hanging around home or around the town because they did the training for work and pursued an education.  It is the fault of the Government that they are unable to pursue a career because the Government sleepwalked through ten to 12 years of an economic boom during which little or no infrastructure was put in place.  It allowed the property bubble to expand and this is what has us where we are.I will conclude because other speakers are indicating and we will facilitate them even if the Government will not.  One of the biggest hurts in this whole package of budgetary measures is the penalising of people with medical cards by forcing them to pay for medication when there was another way.  The Government could have talked to the GPs who are writing the prescriptions for excessive medications and not the poor people on the other side of the desk.  The Government is putting its hand into the pockets of people who demonstrably, are in need, by virtue of the fact they hold a medical card under very stringent criteria for its possession.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	505	Amendments could have been submitted up until the completion of Second Stage but I do not wish to argue the technical aspects.I oppose section 3 of the Bill because the cuts being proposed in section 3 are unjust.  It is timely that the latest set of inflation figures were published subsequent to the budget.  When the Minister for Finance came to the House on Wednesday he was working on the basis that annual inflation was running at 6.5%.  The European measure of inflation which is a far more accurate measure shows that inflation is running at 2.8% which is 1.2% less than the cut in the social welfare budget introduced on Wednesday and 3.2% greater of a cut has been proposed this year when the Christmas bonus is taken into account along with the cut announced on Wednesday.  These cuts are unjust and unfair, especially to carers, the disabled, blind people and it is morally wrong to introduce a cut of 6%.  As my colleague, Deputy Kenny said, this is the first Minister in eight years who has introduced cuts to the must vulnerable in our society.  The cuts before us fail to recognise the important role of carers in our community.  Carers are people who give up work to care for an elderly or disabled person in the home thus saving the State approximately €40,000 a year and now having made that decision to commit to the long-term care of an individual, the Minister is cutting their payments.I have two questions for the Minister.  The adult dependant allowance for those under 66 years is being cut.  In the case of a person in receipt of a contributory old age pension, is the adult dependant allowance for a spouse under 66 years also being cut?  If this is the case it is a misrepresentation to say that pensioners are not being affected by these cuts because we know they are being affected by the withdrawal of the Christmas bonus.The Minister referred on Second Stage to the issue of fraud.  I have a letter dated 9 September 2009 relating to an applicant who was signing on for credits for jobseeker's benefit.  In this letter of 9 September she has been told that the next date for signing on is 7 July 2010.  I am informed the reason it is being dragged out for so long is because there is a backlog of these cases and overcrowding in the local offices and the person is not in receipt of a payment.  The individual in question, who is a non-Irish European citizen, is receiving credits for entitlement to some of benefit payments at a future date.  If the Minister is focused on fraud, how is it possible for a person to be told to sign on again in 11 months at which point he or she will be given credited contributions for the intervening period?  This contradicts her argument that she is tough on fraud.  It is frustrating for people to see the Minister cut basic payments to vulnerable people while turning a blind eye to fraud.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	506	In recent months, the Minister and her colleagues have repeated the mantra that their priority is to protect the vulnerable.  While their media advice may be that people will start to believe something if it is repeated sufficiently often, their mantra is a patent and blatant untruth.  The Minister has not fulfilled her responsibility to protect the weakest.  Even in difficult times, her predecessors fought their corner on behalf of the least well-off.  Thousands of people look to the Minister to protect their incomes but she has clearly bought into the right-wing agenda of cutting the incomes of those at the margins.  Rather than protecting the weakest, she has protected the richest, the millionaires, while allowing savage cuts to the incomes of the poorest.People have been completely misled by the Government spin we heard before the budget.  If the Minister had any shame, she would think again about the position she holds.  Perhaps her title should change to "Minister for Corporate Welfare" because she has protected the corporate welfare system.  People with large incomes and substantial wealth are being entirely spared.  The Government continues to facilitate those who have stashed away large amounts of money in pension schemes or property based schemes to avoid tax.  The Minister, in protecting the strongest and wealthiest and hitting those on the lowest incomes, is engaging in morally indefensible and unacceptable behaviour.  Her job is to protect those on social welfare.Economically, it is stupid to cut social welfare benefits because recipients cannot afford to save them and, by and large, spend every penny of their payment in local shops and on local services.  This helps the economy.  The Government is proposing to remove from the economy 4% of all social welfare payments while leaving untouched those who are best able to carry some of the burden, namely, people who can stash away or spend large sums abroad.  This does little to help the economy.  The Minister's approach does not make sense economically.The Minister referred to the consumer price index, CPI.  While we are all aware of the headline CPI figures, it is necessary to drill down into them.  For example, the figure changes significantly if one removes housing from the equation.  Although people with mortgages have benefited from interest rate reductions, many of those in receipt of welfare benefits do not have a mortgage.  For such persons, the deflation rate is, therefore, much closer to 3% than 6%.The Minister decided to cut social welfare payments by 4%.  In addition, the value of the payments has declined by 2% as a result of the abolition of the Christmas bonus.  A significant number of social welfare recipients will also be hit by the increase in the threshold for the drug payments scheme.  In real terms, the increase in costs from this measure is close to 2.5% because those affected by it will have to spend an additional €5 per week on medicines.  Those in receipt of rent supplement will suffer a 4% cut.  For a large number of recipients of social welfare payments, therefore, the cumulative effect of the cuts in payments will be approximately12.5%.  There is no defence for imposing a cut of in excess of 12% in the income of many social welfare recipients.The Vincentian Partnership for Justice and other groups have done detailed research which shows that in most cases welfare payments are not sufficient to enable recipients, especially families with children, to live life with any kind of basic dignity.  The reason we have a national anti-poverty strategy is to ensure Ministers should not introduce new proposals without first assessing how the proposals will impact on the poor.  Every budget since 1998 has been poverty-proofed, as required under the national anti-poverty strategy.  The Cabinet handbook states that memoranda for the Government involving significant policy proposals must indicate clearly the impact of the proposals on groups in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.  For the third time I ask the Minister to inform the House if she has complied with the requirement to poverty-proof and assess the impact of these major proposals on people who are in poverty or at risk of poverty.  Has this document been done and will she provide it?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I oppose the section.  Starting salaries for Deputies are approximately €100,100 per annum.  This is the salary paid to me, as I have not received increments or other payments.  After the 7.5% cut is applied to my salary, I will still be paid €92,500, subject to income tax and other deductions.  The reduction is extremely modest when compared to what will happen to people who find themselves unemployed in future, particularly those aged under 24 years.While I appreciate the correct decision by the Taoiseach and Ministers to take a further pay cut of 5%, the reduction should have been substantially higher.  Parliamentarians in Australia, for example, are paid AU $72,000 per annum.  I am not sure of the precise exchange rate but understand this equates to approximately €50,000.  Australia has a population of more than 21 million.  As these figures show, Irish politicians are grossly overpaid and there is a case for making a substantial further reduction to their pay, certainly to €80,000 per Deputy per annum capped at €100,000.  It is easier to target people earning in excess of €100,000 per annum than those with an income of €204 per week.The proposition before us is disgraceful.  I hope some of the Independent Deputies, prodigal sons or whatever they are called will rise up and reject the budget.

That has been the normal practice since 1998.  I suspect from the Minister's reply that she does not know what we are talking about.

She does not realise that under the requirements of the Cabinet handbook every year since 1998 the budget is poverty-proofed officially by the social inclusion unit within the Department.  The report of that poverty proofing exercise and the assessment of the budget in terms of the impact it is likely to have on people in poverty or at risk of poverty is included in the budget as part of the official documentation.  Clearly, she does not realise this has been the practice.

Why was it not done this year, when the budget has a vastly negative impact on people living in the margins, the most vulnerable people whom the Minister promised she would protect?  Where is it?  Has the Government completely forgotten about it this year?

I am well aware of what the Deputy is talking about.  The poverty impact assessment is being prepared by the social inclusion unit of my Department which has incorporated the Combat Poverty Agency, as I indicated already.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	532	This is not done some days or weeks after the budget.  It is done when the budget is going to Cabinet.  Along with the memoranda for Government, there is a requirement that a poverty proofing document be prepared on any proposal such that the Cabinet can assess the impact of such proposals on people living in poverty.  Was that done or not?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I will follow from Deputy Shortall's remarks.  Will the Minister clarify if the poverty proofing document was presented to Cabinet?  Was the Cabinet in the position that it made a decision on the details of the budget without such information being made available?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13519	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I wish to be helpful to the Minister and in no way to appear facetious, but the process was instigated by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias de Rossa.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I will be brief because we should get to as many amendments and sections as possible.  At the time of the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency I was a Member of the Oireachtas.  I observed and was involved with the evolution of poverty proofing while working in the area of social policy.  The purpose of the poverty proofing exercise that made its way into the Cabinet handbook was such that as the budget was being prepared the Government would be able to test the impact of a proposal on the affected or vulnerable group.  That is totally different from preparing a descriptive scheme after the fact.  The essence of the original Combat Poverty Agency proposal was to test the impact before it happened.  Therefore, to suggest there will be a description some days after the budget leaves open the question of whether the principle has been sacrificed.  It is a fact that since 1998 poverty proofing, in accordance with the Cabinet handbook, has been integral to the budget.  It was the evidence that the budget had been so tested.  There is a real difference and this requires an explanation, especially in a budget with such an impact on the very groups to which the handbook refers, namely, those in poverty and threatened with poverty.

I put a very specific question.  Was the document provided to Cabinet?  Did it have the document available when the decision was being made?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The Cabinet considered all elements of this budget including the impact it would have.  We considered not only the rates and value of cuts in respect of social welfare but changes in other Departments that might impact on the same people.  We also took into account the consumer price index, CPI, figures.  I accept that not everyone has benefited in the same way from the change in prices.  An analysis was carried out by the Department of Finance in respect of the decrease in prices during the year and how it has affected people.  We examined that analysis carefully.  The analysis suggested the CPI fell for retired households by 3.25%, one of our considerations in making decisions in respect of pensioners.  Prices decreased by 5.75% for unemployed households and 7.5% for working households.  Although the analysis shows the highest income people have benefited more from the drop in prices, the lowest income people have also benefited greatly from it.  We considered the matter very carefully to establish the position in respect of the increases of 3.5% for this year.  The process was carried out very carefully across Departments to establish the impact.  Nevertheless, we found ourselves in the position of having to make these proposals.

We are within our rights to ask the Minister specifically about the fact that a document which normally appears and is published with the Budget Statement has not appeared this year.  It is not only our right to ask the Minster.  She is required to produce it under the national anti-poverty strategy.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Deputy should use the phrase, "The Minister is required..."
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The Government is required to produce it.  When the matter was raised this morning by Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Gilmore, the Tánaiste and other senior Ministers were in the Chamber.  They were stunned because clearly they were not aware of the requirement.  Now, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has confirmed she is equally ignorant of the requirement to produce this document, because she has provided the House with some blather about something being done after the event.  The Cabinet handbook is very specific about the requirements under the national anti-poverty strategy.  It is not simply a matter of considering it.  A statement of the likely impact on those at risk of poverty must be provided.

Under the national anti-poverty strategy, the Minister is required to produce a statement which amounts to a poverty proofing of his proposals.  That statement must follow the guidelines set down by the social inclusion unit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Was that statement produced?  Did the Minister for Finance know that he was required to produce that?  Did the Minister for Social and Family Affairs realise that such a document was required?  It is clear from her response today that she does not seem to have been aware of that.  Given that the Minister is not in a position to answer the question, can we take a short break or can the Minister arrange for the Minister for Finance to be asked that specific question, whether he has complied with the requirements of the Cabinet handbook under the national anti-poverty strategy to produce a document, a statement setting out the likely impact of his budget proposals on those at risk of poverty?

I reiterate, the Government is required to produce a statement.  It is not a matter of the opinion of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, or any other member of the Cabinet.  The Cabinet is required to produce a statement outlining the likely impact of the budget proposals on those living in poverty or at risk of poverty.  Has the Cabinet complied with the requirements in the Cabinet handbook?

We are talking about a 6% cut this side of Christmas, and after Christmas, to social assistance payments to those under the age of 66 and yet Ministers are only taking an additional 5% cut in their salaries.  The types of cuts proposed for the most vulnerable people in society are immoral.  It is disgraceful admission by the Government that the poverty-proofing document, which should have been provided to the Cabinet prior to making and signing off on this decision, was not presented to it.Will the Minister respond to an issue which has come to my attention in regard to the carer's allowance and the free travel scheme?  I have a constituent who is in receipt of the carer's allowance for a child under the age of 16 but over the age of eight.  While the carer gets the free travel pass, the child does not and the carer must pay for the child to attend hospital in Dublin four times each month.  Since the costs involved would be minuscule, surely an amendment could be made to the free travel scheme when it comes before us next year to deal with that limited number of cases
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	569	In regard to people who depend on social assistance payments, the scale of the cuts contained in the Bill are completely acceptable.  The Government had choices about how it would make the savings of €4 billion.  There was no need to hit people on the lowest incomes.  The Government could have required those who are very well off, in particular millionaires, to make a contribution and share the burden in terms of balancing the books.The Labour Party set out in detail how the Government could have done that, including ending the property reliefs available, the over-generous reliefs for pensions for millionaires and addressing the prospect of a third rate of tax for high earners.  The Government had choices and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, along with the rest of the Cabinet, chose to hit the most vulnerable rather than the better off or the millionaires who could have made a significant contribution to bridging the €4 billion gap.  It was a conscious decision by this Government to hit the weakest and attack the vulnerable, which is utterly unacceptable on any level.Given that the Minister has had an opportunity to speak to the Minister for Finance, will she clarify the reason we have not received a statement on the impact of this budget on the poor?

I have been here for many years and it is the first time we have had to address a section of a social welfare Bill where we are taking money from people.  Of all the cutbacks in the area, the most severe are the withdrawal of money from the visually impaired and, in particular, the half carer's allowance.I had a mother from my constituency on to me yesterday with a cry from the core of her heart.  This woman, a widow, is looking after a son who eight years ago had a serious road accident as a result of a brain haemorrhage.  The man was 30 at the time and is almost 38 now, and he lives on his island home with his mother, who looks after him 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The man comes to Beaumont Hospital now and again; he spent 40 days at the hospital last summer.  His mother accompanied him across the waves to Dublin and sat by his bedside in the hospital holding his hand day and night.He is a brilliant man, the eldest, who helped his mother raise the rest of his family.  They all have jobs now but he was the main breadwinner when his father died.  The only person who this 38-year-old man can communicate with is his mother.  I know these people and I was in the hospitals in Letterkenny and Beaumont when he was there.  I hope to see him within the next week again.The woman was in touch with the Department and got a very sympathetic hearing from whoever was there, although she wanted to speak to the Minister.  She understands the difficulties and pressures felt by the Minister as well.  I told the woman I would try to be her voice in Dáil Eireann today, when I would have the opportunity to put the case before the Minister.  She is providing a service and it was a terrible knock to her the day before yesterday when she was told that her half carer's allowance was to be reduced.  She told me it was not about the money she would lose, be it €4 or €5, although she could do with every euro she could get.  She told me that what she has been doing for eight years does not seem to get any recognition or sympathy from anybody.

If that boy was in hospital, it would cost the State hundreds of thousands of euro per year, and it would have cost €1 million over the course of the eight years.  The consultant in Beaumont, who I will name to the Minister in private as I do not want to give names in the House, said that the man would have been dead years ago if not for the mother's loving and tender care.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Is she over 66?

We often overlook this area.  I know this woman and her family and there are probably many such examples throughout the country.  There is an 82-year-old grandmother in my constituency whose grandson had a serious accident a year and a half ago.  He is a young boy not yet 20 but he cannot talk, walk, eat or anything else for himself.  That woman is lucky because although she is giving the same kind of care as the first woman, she will not lose anything because she happens to be 82 years old.  There is a discrepancy.However, I told this Donegal mother that I knew the Minister very well and that she is humane and does not have a heart of stone.  She comes from a good Christian family and I know her parents.  I do not say this in a patronising fashion.  I do not think the Minister would take this action deliberately against that woman.  I told her if I had the opportunity during the debate of this Bill to put that simple case to the Minister, I would do so.It is not the money that worries the woman but the fact that her dedication over the course of the past eight years, no matter whether her son is in Donegal or the hospitals in Letterkenny and Dublin, is not recognised.  She is by her son's side.  To put it mildly, it is very cruel for her to be deducted the €4 or €5 per week.  She will continue caring for her son anyway and will never let him go to hospital.  He will get the care which she gives in a professional manner; that has been recognised in every hospital from here to Donegal, including the one in Dublin.I am very concerned about this and I know the Minister will demonstrate concern also.  I do not know if the Minister can do anything about this but perhaps we can propose an amendment to the Bill.  A mother of such dedication, or a parent or carer who has given that amount of time, care and nursing to people who cannot communicate or do anything for themselves, should not have the allowance cut.  This House would not be living up to its reputation as a humane place or a democracy if we deprived that woman of these €4 or €5.Ultimately, she wants some recognition for what she and others like her are doing.  Only mothers give tender and loving care like this.  I am thankful for the opportunity to put this on record.  There is a discrepancy and perhaps the Minister will have the opportunity to put it right.  This woman was on to the Department yesterday and very well received by whomever she spoke to, although she was emotional.  Anybody who knew the case would also be emotional.

The effect is to substantially cut the payments of jobseekers, in particular, who are under 24 or 25.  It also deals with the new rates for one-parent families, carer's allowance and the blind pension.  I mentioned in contributions last night and earlier that the effect will be to drive people into poverty.  There are many organisations which are set up to help people who are down on their luck or who have not had the required social investment and must avail of services of community groups or other groups set up to help them.As news of the budget spreads, we will witness the full effects.  Most journalists have not recognised the scale of the cuts.  I received telephone calls, e-mails and so on all morning from project administrators in my area who have been informed by the Department of Education and Science that their funding will be cut next year.  These include a family project on James's Street and Familiscope in Ballyfermot.  Virtually every mainstream drugs project in receipt of funding from that Department has been informed it will suffer a 28% cut next year.These groups have helped those who depend on social welfare to bridge the gap for many years.  The poorest of the poor and the most disadvantaged are not only being kicked around by the Government through social welfare cuts but the projects on which they have depended to help them overcome years of non-investment are also being tackled.  Great work has been done, and is planned, under the RAPID programme but its budget has been cut by 25% for 2010.The new rates for social welfare recipients are outlined in section 4 and the Schedule.  In some cases, those who become redundant or who cannot source employment are being asked to survive on €100 a week.  By contrast, the remuneration of the chief executive officers of semi-State companies in 2007 was as follows: Bord na Móna, more than €300,000; An Bord Pleanála, more than €220,000; CIE, €270,000; ESB, more than €500,000; Enterprise Ireland, more than €200,000; Coillte — the planting of trees justifies a salary of €400,000, which is absolute madness——

That is the Government's fault, not theirs because they do not set the high level of remuneration.

We recently heard about the nice bonus Professor Drumm of the HSE was paid on top of his generous salary.  The chief executive officer of the Irish Aviation Authority has an annual salary of €350,000 while the national lottery chairman receives €280,000 a year.  An Post will cut 1,300 jobs shortly while the chief executive officer earns €414,000 per annum to put people on the dole.  If they are aged under 24, they will receive jobseeker's benefit at a rate of €150 per week or €100 a week if they are aged under 21.  That is a disgrace and that is the scandal of this Bill.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I strongly oppose this section.  It must be recognised that if it was not for the late Ernest Blythe cutting the old age pension 80 years ago, for which he has been condemned by Fianna Fáil ever since, the old age pension would have been cut by the Government.  These cutbacks are even worse.  Elderly people are reasonably well off in comparison to others.  However, a widow with three young children who has a part-time job will suffer multiple cutbacks.  Unless one has lived with a social welfare recipient, one will not understand.  I lived with my mother, who was blind, for six years before her death.  The fact that the payment to the visually impaired is being cut in the Bill to allow Anglo Irish Bank to be bailed out on behalf of builders, developers and bankers is extremely sick.Will the Minister rethink these cutbacks?  The weakest in our society, including the disabled, the handicapped, the carers, the blind and the widows will bear the brunt of the budget.  I support the comments about young people.  Fine Gael said their payments should be cut if they refused to take up employment or a training place but the Minister is providing that their payment will be cut regardless.  She should examine how she can at least avoid cutting the payments of the worst off.  I refer to a young man I know who is in a wheelchair.  His allowance will be cut and his mother, who is a carer, will also suffer a cutback.  She is a long way off 65 years and she needs some sympathy.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13519	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	581	If those on jobseeker's benefit aged under 24 are residing with their parents, will there be a pro rata cut to reflect the parents’ means?  I have received more and more calls from parents whose sons or daughters recently left college and are living at home.  They have a high dependency on the parental income to give them spending power.  How will they be affected?The reduction in income for claimants in this category will have a detrimental effect because the Minister's announcement about additional training places has not been set out in concrete form.  We do not know what shape the places will take or whether a demographic or qualitative study has been conducted as to who in this category would slot into the places.   We do not know how they will slot in or what type of course they will take up.  This is ill thought out.  The overarching philosophy of the Minister was to drive a coach and four through those who most need that marginal income without any thought or lateral view of how this might impact on them.  Will the Minister outline how this cut will affect those people if their parents' income is above a certain level?  I fear for them.  For example, if a parent who works in the public sector has an income up to €40,000 per annum and has a son or daughter who has just graduated, it is most likely that son or daughter is now living at home because he or she cannot get a job.  If that graduate son or daughter cannot find an adequate training place because, as has been stated, he or she is over qualified for the training position, will he or she now be penalised through a reduced payment because of refusing a training place?  What negative effect will this have on their income if they live at home.  These are issues of concern.  In talking about active labour market mechanisms for people who are under the age of 25, the Minister should have thought a little more laterally about putting some well thought out schemes in place before effecting a cut.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The content of the budget delivered here on Wednesday has sent shock waves through those in the lower economic dependent sector of the State.  The people affected drastically are those most in need.  When one looks to a Government, no matter who is in Government, one looks for fairness, honesty and a sense of belonging.  Significant trust is placed in those in positions of responsibility and we trust they will deliver fairness and equality for their people.At some stage in our lives, all of us were inspired by the Proclamation of 1916, which expressly declared that the State would cherish all the children of the nation equally.  I do not direct my comment personally at the Minister, but at the Government.  It has totally betrayed the content of the 1916 Proclamation.  The men and women who fought for equality and freedom for our country paid a huge price.  They gave their lives and gave up everything they had and trusted us to live up to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  The Government, however, has discriminated against those most in need.  It has discriminated against people dependent on invalidity pensions, illness benefit, blind person's pension, payments to one-parent families, carer's allowance, guardian payments and on non-contributory widow's and widower's pensions.  It has discriminated against the most vulnerable in our communities.  It has exacerbated an already drastic situation for people in need.All of us work in our communities, as elected representatives should.  Most of my work and that of my colleagues is in areas of most need, areas that are socially deprived and that have been abandoned by the systems of the State.  These people have been discriminated against from a young age because of being part of a poor family.  They are condemned to poverty by the type of system that ensures they will never have a proper, full education and will never let them realise the potential every child is gifted with at birth.  The Government is now making matters worse for those who live on low incomes who depend on unemployment benefit and on the State.  A Government should be judged on how it treats its citizens, in particular those who are most vulnerable.  If they are the criteria, the Minister and the Government have failed miserably.I wonder whether anybody in Government comprehends what it means to be dependent on farm assist.  Farmers have struggled continuously, particularly small farmers who have been the soul and backbone of the country for generations.  Irrespective of what part of the country Deputies come from, their roots go back to rural Ireland and to the small farmer communities.  The small farmer community has survived without hand-outs.  A few weeks ago I met a person from my parish who has seven cattle and who gets REPs payments of approximately €2,500 to €3,000 per year.  At best, his income is less than €5,000 a year.  When this was brought to my attention, I went to meet him.  He shops less and has cut back on living expenses.  He does not socialise and cannot go out and has lived that way for years now.  The only communication he has on a regular basis is with his dog.  That is what is happening in the rural community.  We are struggling to get farm assist for this man.  I am sure we will get it for him, but there is a significant backlog because so many people are so deprived economically.On Wednesday, we saw, probably, the most disgraceful budget ever seen.  We have all lived through the Celtic tiger, but that tiger did not help the small farmer, fishermen or people dependent on unemployment benefit.  They are not unemployed by choice, but because unemployment was forced on them.  More and more people are becoming dependent on the State to survive.  What are we doing about that?  My colleague read out earlier the incomes of CEOs.  We saw sleight of hand in the budget with regard to the incomes of Ministers and junior Ministers.  We were informed they took a 15% cut when, in reality, all they suffered was a 5% cut.  The Government could not even be honest about this.  At the same time it is taking over 4% from the unemployed.  This is a significant amount to take from those with very little.  Even if it was a 15% cut for Ministers, which it was not, that would be as nothing for those earning between €100,000 and €200,000 a year.The system in this State operates to discriminate against the poor, those in need and those dependent on assistance.  Neither the State nor the Government have any concept of what it is to be part of the marginalised poor, who are now becoming a bigger constituency here.  The poor do not matter to the Government as most of them do not vote.  This is how it appears the Government is operating currently.  Its concerns are for the wealthy and those with money, people who exploited others to get that money with which they can control the political system.  How much influence has the tent at the Galway races had on consecutive Governments, and, in particular, on the main party in the current Government?I would like to quote from the principles of ethical conduct, as outlined by the Standards in Public Office Commission:A successful ethics regime is one which provides mechanisms whereby the sensitivities of political/public life can be handled, where competing interests can be reconciled and where individual legislators/executives can be guided in their difficult decisions by reference to the general principle that the public interest should always take precedence over the interests of the individual and, perhaps more important, over the interests of a political party whether in power or in opposition.These are the guiding principles of every person in the Government.  Does that principle state that we can give huge salaries to CEOs such as Professor Brendan Drumm, while we take €8 per week off somebody who is living on €208?  Are these the principles that guide the ethics of this Government?  Reading the budget that has been presented to us, there is no doubt that such is the case.The Government has betrayed the principle of ethical conduct.  More important, it has betrayed the poor and the marginalised people in our society and in our communities.  It has propped up and supported the big fat business class, the developers and the bankers.  It has condemned future generations to pay off these huge debts in order to facilitate those who control the political system in this State, be it Mr. Tony O'Reilly's media empire, bankers or developers.  This State has descended into providing power where the wealth lies.  This power is provided at the expense of those at the lower rungs of the ladder, who act as cannon fodder to provide what is necessary in order to keep those fat cats in the style to which they are accustomed.The Government has no mandate whatsoever to do what it did last Wednesday.  It was not elected to penalise the poor.  It was not elected to discriminate against those most in need.  It was elected to be fair, honest and true to our people and their equal rights.  Unfortunately, it has betrayed everything it was supposed to stand for.  There is only one resolution to what is happening.  The honourable thing to do would be to step down and let the people decide who they want to lead them through these most difficult times, which were created by the political establishment of this State.Many of us are lucky enough to have children and grandchildren.  The Government and the establishment have condemned them to decades of hardship to pay for what has been inflicted on them.  The debts inflicted on them have been inflicted by the failed policies of this Government and the failed policies of rampant capitalism.  The Government has looked after the wealthy and let the poor go to hell.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	583	In 2004, the National Disability Authority and Indecon carried out research into the cost of disability payment.  They maintained at the time that there was an additional cost of living payment for people with disabilities of about €40 per week.  They recognised that a person with a disability has more costs, because he or she needs extra heating, extra clothes and possibly a special diet and so on.  Since then, organisations such as the Disability Federation of Ireland have been lobbying for this payment for the special cost of disability.  Instead of giving these people more, the Government has decided to reduce the payment by €8.30 per week, which is about €431 per annum.  It does not seem like much, but for a person on €10,000 per annum, it is a lot.  This is particularly the case when an advisory body set up by this House to advise on disabilities decided that an extra payment was needed.Did the National Disability Authority give any advice to the Government?  Was it asked for any advice on the impact of reducing this payment to people with disabilities?  If this has not happened, does the Minister have any intention of consulting with the National Disability Authority on the impact of these cutbacks on people with disabilities, carers and so on?  Many of these people are housebound and they are in need of support rather than being attacked.Carers are often looking after these people, and their payment is also being cut.  It will make it very difficult for people who are already on the edge.  Many of these people with disabilities may have to go into institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals.  This will be at an increased cost to the State, not at a reduced cost.  I implore the Minister to look at this again.  I will not be supporting this cut.  It would have been bad enough to leave it as it was, but to reduce it is appalling.  These people have already lost the Christmas bonus and many of them have seen rent supplement reduced.  The Government also closed down the Combat Poverty Agency, which was an independent body that commented on issues like this.People with disabilities are two and a half times more likely to be unemployed.  The Minister for Finance has told us that anybody under 65 can get a job and supplementary income.  That is not possible for many people with a disability.  This is one particular group of people that has been singled out by the Government.  Either Fianna Fáil is completely in the pockets of very wealthy people who have got off scot free, or else the country is in such a bad way that we are going down the Swanee very quickly.  This Government has been in charge for the last 12 years, so it is responsible for that.  We seem to be dealing with heartless Ministers and a heartless Government, but I appeal to anybody in Fianna Fáil with a conscience not to cut payments to people with disabilities such as blind people, many of whom have barely enough to continue.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shouted across the floor of the Chamber this morning that we opposed increases.  We did not oppose the increases given by the former Minister, the late Seamus Brennan.  We worked with him and supported him in much of what he did.  We encouraged him to bring forward a policy to deal with young carers.  That has not happened.  These are children working at home caring for adults and others with disabilities.  There has been no policy from the Government on this, nor on cohabitation, even though policy was promised on it years ago.  These cuts are retrograde and I implore that they be rescinded.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I am reminded of Harold Wilson's phrase that a week is a long time in politics.  A year is longer again and two years must be equal to an eternity.  Two years ago, this Government was telling us that the country was fine.  It repeated the mantra that the economic fundamentals were sound.  We were told that we had a bright future.  Something must have happened in the meantime, because the first soundings we heard in the long grass were that the public sector was a problem and had caused a serious dent in that economic boom.Things have since moved on to the unemployed, including those who had never been unemployed in their lives.  People with disabilities — such as those in wheelchairs — their carers and those who provide support services with disabilities are suddenly in the eye of the storm and are apparently to blame for what went wrong.I appeal those Members of both parties in government who struggled manfully with their consciences in recent weeks — the finally overcame them at the last moment — to reconsider matters.  When they sit down to eat dinner on Christmas day, they should think about what they have done to the most vulnerable at this particularly difficult time.  Is it really being stated that those to whom I refer caused the bubble to burst?  Previously, those in the public service were blamed in this regard.There is another group of people, some of whom have been made unemployed for the first time and others who have yet to become unemployed, that is now being targeted.  A decision has been made to the effect that if certain individuals have not been poor before, then those in power are going to work at making them poor.  It appears that those in power intend to take pleasure in doing this.  Every Member on the Government side who contributed on Second Stage indicated that they intend to vote in favour of the budget and this Bill because that is the right thing to do.  On what basis is it the right thing to do?  Is it because the people who have become the victims are to blame?  Did they cause the difficulties in which we find ourselves?We have been continually informed that social welfare payments here are higher than those which obtain in Northern Ireland or the UK.  The Government has responsibility in this regard.  After all, it was the Government which increased the rates of pay.  People who are unfortunate enough to be on social welfare did not launch a campaign in order to obtain a bigger slice of the cake.  It was the Government which increased the rates of payment.  It is ironic that the Government is informing those to whom I refer that they may have had good times in the past but that those good times are gone.  It is also stating that if people were of the view that they might enjoy good times again in the future, it is going to ensure that this will not be the case.The Acting Chairman is a right-thinking and fair man.  It must, therefore, seem a complete contradiction to him that in a society in which we have tried to be fair and honest to all the people and to treat all of the nation's children equally, it has suddenly been decided that the banking system must be protected, shored up and allowed to continue as before.  The Acting Chairman soldiered in the same trenches in respect of this matter in the past.  We recall the guarantees provided by those in the banking sector and we know that as soon as the latter left the building, the guarantees were forgotten.  That is one of the sad aspects of all of this.The saddest aspect is that those in the banking sector seem to have been rewarded.  They received a pat on the back and a nod of approval rather than a rap on the knuckles.  The old system of salaries has been retained.  Why would that not be the case?  These are important people who have done no wrong.  What wrong have the unemployed, widows or people with special needs done?  Why are they being punished.  Where stands the concept of fairness in our Constitution?The Members opposite who repeatedly and resolutely stated on Second Stage that they want to vote in favour of the budget — which contains the impositions to which I refer that will affect people who, with every day that passes, are becoming increasingly victimised — should carefully reconsider their position.  Christmas is supposed to mean something to everyone.  They should not allow Christmas to pass without once again struggling with their consciences.  Perhaps on this occasion they might manfully overcome them and side with the people who will be made poor by this horrific budget and the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I am completely opposed to this section.  I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that it is probably the most odious section in the Bill.Do the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and his colleagues on the Government benches — and the six Independents or whatever one might call them who are going to support the Bill — believe it is fair and reasonable to cut approximately €35 per month from the blind pension and of the order of €100 per week from young unemployed people who are on jobseeker's allowance?  Do they think this is reasonable when Ministers are being paid approximately €200,000 per annum?  Is it reasonable that when cuts are being imposed on low-income earners, Ministers' pensions are continuing to grow?  Given that Oireachtas pensions are probably worth over €50,000 per annum and ministerial pensions are probably worth a further €70,000 per annum, Ministers are being well paid for the deeds they are perpetrating in this House.  It must be remembered that the members of the Cabinet who are also teachers will receive pensions in this regard which will be in excess of €12,000 per annum.These individuals, who will receive very large pensions, have no compunction with regard to taking €35 per month away from someone on a blind pension or in countenancing the other cuts that are being made across the board.  We have been informed that payments to young people who are on jobseeker's allowance will be cut if they do not take up positions on training or educational courses.  The Government indicated that it is to create approximately 26,000 additional training and education places.  However, there are 425,000 people on the dole.  As a result, there are not enough positions available on courses for those who are unemployed.  In view of the fact that the number of people on the live register is going to increase during the next six months, why does the Government believe there will be an adequate number of positions available?  The VTOS and back-to-education allowances are also being cut.  As a result, there will be even fewer positions available.It is unfortunate that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is absent from the Chamber.  On Second Stage she said, "Receiving the full adult rate of jobseeker's payment at a young age without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency".  Welfare dependency indeed.  What is proposed will lead to welfare poverty.  Young people have no option but to depend on welfare when they cannot obtain employment.  They cannot obtain employment because the Government has wrecked the economy.  The Government encouraged the type of property speculation which led us into the credit crisis and which has given rise to the difficulties we now face.  It was aided in this by the corrupt bankers and greedy speculators who all form part of the golden circle.  The Minister is now stating that these young people could become welfare dependent.  How could she and the Government have got it so wrong?  They should be more concerned with regard to welfare poverty.

Deputy Durkan referred to a week being a long time in politics.  It is clear that a minute is also a long time in politics, particularly when one considers that the person occupying the ministerial chair across the Chamber has changed from a female to a male.  It is interesting that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Calleary, has taken the place of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.

However, we are discussing legislation relating to social welfare.  We are also discussing people who care for others, namely, the disabled, those in the poorest sections of society, the blind and individuals with myriad other problems.  It is interesting that a Minister of State from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in the Chamber, which gives the lie to how this Government is approaching the problem.  It is all about bean counting, not prioritisation or realising there must be cuts across the public services to reduce costs.  Instead of prioritising these cuts, a blunt instrument has been used.  The Government has gone after blind people, the disabled and the people who care for them.  They are on a pittance as it is and large sections of society remain untouched.  Pensions in excess of €100,000 for disgraced public servants, in some cases, are untouched.  That is hardly justice.This seems to be a concerted attack on the poorest sections of society.  People talk about those in the private sector having suffered, and they have, but it is quite clear that the Government intends for many more to suffer.  The budget provides for 75,000 more people to lose their jobs, which means 75,000 more people in receipt of social welfare and 75,000 more people trying to get access to a medical card.  There is a concerted effort to deprive people of medical cards.  I have received telephone calls from people all over the country, including from people next door to the office in Finglas.  Some 100 people per month are being taken from the local GP lists.  People cannot access their medical cards and a security guard is at the office to stop people from inquiring.  Elderly ladies are being blocked by burly security guards.  This is ridiculous.  God help those around the country who do not know where to go to find out about the medical card being taken from them.  People can go to the GP, who will never refuse to treat them.  What about the pharmacists?  How will they give out medicine when the patient does not have a medical card?  They will not get their medicine and they will end up in hospital.Today I heard about the 97-year-old lady from north Dublin, who has been waiting for two days on a trolley with a fractured hip.  She cannot have her operation because there is no post-operation bed available.  What about her carer?  We wish her well and hope she will be home soon.  The Government is further undermining her.The new measures on drugs and prescription charges are another attack on the most vulnerable and the sickest in our society.  When one thinks about what has happened in the past where some people are on a pension of €500,000, having wrecked a bank and the banking system in this country and another man is escorted to jail by two gardaí for not paying his dog licence, it is a damning indictment of the sort of society this Government has created.The cap on the dental excess will create a waiting list for medical card holders.  People will be in pain with toothaches and will need fillings.  It seems so frustrating for people because they know that this €4 billion is already gone.  Anglo Irish Bank is already waving a flag for another €5.8 billion and the money saved in this budget, and more besides, will go straight to Anglo Irish Bank.  Speaking on "The Last Word", the Tánaiste said that this money was off balance sheet.  Matt Cooper's reply took the words out of my mouth when he said that this is the clever, smart alec accountancy that got us into this mess in the first place.I oppose this section of the Bill.  As I left Lusk, the back of the car of one of my constituents displayed "NAMA -- Nursing Assets for Ministerial Associates".
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The measure of any society is how well it looks after those less capable of looking after themselves.  I refer to the Fianna Fáil slogan that cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  It is not often that Members can speak on one section of a Bill that encapsulates everything about the Government.  These cuts will hurt the old, the sick and handicapped.  They are absolutely shameful.  The Minister for Finance said there was no alternative, a message that has been put out by a number of Fianna Fáil spokespersons, their colleagues in the Green Party and the backup cronies.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party published alternative policies.  Deputy Reilly referred to dental care, from which €30 million was cut.  That was a €30 million cut from €70 million.  It is one thing to cut a project but removing almost half of it is sabotage.I cannot find reference in the Estimates to the family resource centres.  I referred earlier to how well we care for those who are less capable of looking after themselves.  In family resource centres, a huge number of people provide voluntary assistance.  In the greater scheme of things the cost of these centres was not a lot.  I do not know whether they are good but perhaps someone can tell me.  The contributions bring in some €7 million, which is then disbursed through the system.  How well these moneys are spent bothers me.  It is good if they are spent well but if not, it is a continuation of the waste this Government championed.  Totalling all administration costs of the Departments, there is less than 1% reduction, specifically 0.66%, out of €4.5 billion in all Departments.  Where is the reform?  Where are the people in Fianna Fáil who once were capable of reforming?  Have they all sold their souls to the devil just to remain in government, in case there is an election and Members lose their seats?  They want to stay in there, in the political comfort zone because they have been in government for too long.I do not want to labour the point that this section is despicable.  Every Member who passes through the lobbies this evening is despicable.  They will cut the money that is given to blind people.  They will cut the money given to carers, who are paid a pittance but save the State millions.  Every Fianna Fáil, Green Party, Progressive Democrat or Independent Member who goes through the lobbies should be totally ashamed when the names are struck off.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	590	In terms of delivering reductions in welfare, this section of the Bill is something to be ashamed of for Members on the Government side.  It is presented as a cut of 4% in the social welfare rates for adults but no account is taken of the cut that cancelling the Christmas bonus represents, which will be repeated next year.  This brings the amount to a 6% cut in the net disposable income of the people who have the least.  People may argue that the rate of inflation is -6% but we all know that many people on these levels of payments from the social welfare system do not generally have high mortgages, nor do they benefit from the items that came down in price in the same manner as those at the higher end.  They certainly do not benefit from the ministerial pay increases.  Ministerial pay has been cut by 5% before tax in this budget.  After tax, it is much lower.  The axe is falling on these people, who are at the bottom of the pile, who need support and are dependent on the State to protect them at the time of enormous economic crisis.  Instead of support, the ground is pulled from under them.It is extremely distressing for anyone who is on a low rate of social welfare payments to find that the rate is to be cut even further.  All social welfare payments are low in comparison with the cost of living.  Every economic study shows that levels of inequality in any society grow considerably during recessions.  One of the functions of a social welfare system is to protect society against the consequences of that inequality.  Studies have also shown that typically in Ireland, without the social welfare system, approximately 43% of the population would be living below the poverty line but the effect of the system is such that approximately 14% to 15% are below the poverty line.  We should be proud that the system does what it is supposed to do, redistributes wealth from those who have it to those who need support.  We should work towards pushing that further.Cutting the rates of social welfare for people to whom the economy gives very little while others in very well-paid jobs have not felt any impact in this budget is despicable.  We will increase inequality and poverty.  Studies show that 25% of people on disability payments live below the poverty line.  The Government is cutting their income by another 6%.  No thinking person would feel proud of this.Recent reports have shown that arguably €2 billion is lost to the social welfare system through fraud.  People who are clever are able to get fake PPS numbers, or to rent them.  There were very few controls in the system.  If the level of fraud is one in ten, as some people in the public arena have recently suggested, that would amount to €2 billion of social welfare spending going a-begging which has not been looked after, collected and on which no one has clamped down for the State.  That the lowest payments for adults in the social welfare system are to be further cut while we let that waste go is despicable and not something of which we can be proud.We should do our utmost to ensure that this section does not go through.  It is hard to sell to people who feel that this country and society have given them so little.  There are very few jobs being created for people on the dole.  They may well find themselves trapped in unemployment and those with disabilities who find it hard to get jobs in the first place will find it even harder to do so.  The situation is getting worse.During the big recession, in the 1980s, 46% of those who became unemployed became long-term unemployed.  It is a serious threat to people that the social welfare system, which they hoped would support them, will not do so.  Many have paid for years into social insurance and received very little from it because the economy was booming.  Now when it is not booming the benefits of their contributions are being taken away, not just their dental benefits but the core benefit, what they have to fall back on if they become unemployed, is subject to a deliberate and up-front cut by the Government.  That is a disgrace and we should not support this section at all.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	591	When I sat in this seat on Wednesday morning I caught the eye of four young people in the Visitors Gallery who happened to be speaking through sign language.  My uncle taught me sign language so I was able to engage with them.  When I went up to see them the one question they asked me was whether the Minister for Finance would take money from them.  I said that I did not think he would.  I apologise to those people, and I will call out to see them in Cabra, because I was wrong.When I came into this House five years ago I noticed the sculptures around the Chamber of the men who in 1916 declared a republic, and died for it.  Part of that declaration states:The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.In the past six months we have broken that guarantee twice.  The Minister for Finance has already accepted that NAMA will not work.  This evening the Government will alienate the young people who stood in that gallery and those who are blind.It took us all 48 hours to realise what was going to happen to us.  I had to examine my income to see what I could cut but I can manage it.  I do not care what I have to do.  I could cut out another €1,000 and it would not worry me.  Those people have very little.  I ask Deputy Gogarty not to fly off the handle.  I am capable of doing the same.  He is a champion of schools.  He knows how they will be hit.  The people with disabilities are always left to last.  Deputy Gogarty said last night that he did not like doing it but he was going to do it.  The Ministers have betrayed the men and women who died in 1916.  The backbenchers have a chance to stand up to this.  Deputy Gogarty has an opportunity to do so as well.  The Government cannot take money from people who are not in a position to help themselves.  It cannot take money from the blind or from a girl called Eileen Carolan in my parish.  It cannot take it from the people in St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys.  If power means so much to Deputy Healy-Rae so be it.  I was elected to represent everyone in Ireland, North and South, Catholic and Protestant.  Let Deputy Healy-Rae give up the hospital on which he made a deal, as have all the other Independent Deputies but do not take money from these people whom we are supposed to cherish.I have said before that the Minister is doing a good job at getting back money that has been taken out of the social welfare budget but this money should not be taken.  Anyone who walks up those stairs, as we do every day, should look into the eyes of the men represented by the sculptures, and ask whether he or she is doing the right thing.  That is what I ask them.  Whoever goes to the left is betraying the people who fought for this country so that everyone would be treated equally.  I challenge every Deputy who says he or she is Irish not to accept this.  I ask the Minister to reverse that simple decision to take money from the blind and the disabled.  It is a simple matter but it is the one that will bring her down.  I ask every Deputy if he is man enough or woman enough to stand up for young people who do not have the advantages we have.  I ask that of the Deputies from my county too.We never took a penny from the rich.  I know they are the people who create the employment but they were prepared to give it.  Every time a Deputy walks up those stairs he or she should look those images in the eye and ask that question and anyone who cannot do that should not be here.  For once in their lives they should stand up.  The front bench of the Green Party threw the party away when the NAMA Bill came before us.  Now it will do the same again.  I ask Deputy Gogarty to stand up to it.  He knows right from wrong.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in opposition to this section.  It is at the heart of this budget.  It is a shameless budget that directly attacks the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.  The Green Party is beyond redemption in this matter.  It does not seem to appreciate what is being done in its name.This will ring the death knell for Fianna Fáil, which at least traded in the past on being supportive of the less well off, the vulnerable, the poor and the sick.  Now, it seems it has sold out everything to its high-flying financier, speculator, developer friends.  It is people with disabilities, one-parent families, widows, carers, blind people and guardians who are affected by this section — the most vulnerable, the weakest, the poorest in our society.  They have all been targeted with at least a €8.30 cut.For young people aged 18 to 21, the jobseeker's allowance has been halved and it has been reduced substantially for those aged 22 to 25.  The intention is that these young people are unwanted.  These are the future of Irish society.  Does anyone think this Government wants to cherish them, to keep them here?  No, it wants to get rid of them as quickly as possible.  It wants them out of the country, it wants them to emigrate.  That is exactly what is in this budget — target the weakest and get rid of those who might be some sort of a burden at present because there is no employment, and make sure they are got rid of as quickly as possible.  When one combines this with the cut to the Christmas bonus, it will be a very bleak Christmas for those people who were hoping to have that little extra cheer that made Christmas decent for the many who spend the rest of the year in very difficult circumstances trying to make ends meet.It is still not too late to reconsider this.  There are alternatives, such as in regard to the excise duty that has been reduced for alcohol, and in regard to the well off, who have not been targeted at all, and those identified by IBEC and The Sunday Business Post who had no reduction in their income in 2007 and 2008.  All of the semi-State commercial sector, most of which has received increases, has not been targeted.  Whole sectors of Irish society have not been targeted by this budget in any way.  The most vulnerable sector and the public sector have been exclusively targeted.  Fianna Fáil has sold its soul to those developers who were part and parcel of the Celtic tiger, and who Fianna Fáil cozied up to in the Galway tent and elsewhere.  Now, we see it.  When times get rough, they choose the simplest and easiest target that is available, and it is from this they are extracting all of the money to make the budget balance.There are Members on both sides of the House, including on the Government backbenches and among the Greens and Independents, who are not happy with this budget, which they find hard to stomach.  Deputy Paul Gogarty at least has the decency to listen to the debate, although others do not.  However, they are not happy with this budget.  The point is that there is an alternative.  These people did not realise, not being part and parcel of the dealings that went on, how the trade union movement was drawn down the garden path by Fianna Fáil and how the rug was then pulled from under it at the last moment, or how this budget is being rushed through before Christmas.  All of this has put a lot of pressure on them and they did not realise and tease out the implications of it.  It is being teased out in the best way possible at present.It is clear that this Bill attacks the most vulnerable sectors in society.  From that point of view, it is impossible for any democrat to stand over and the fact there are alternatives makes it doubly impossible.  If we do not hit these sectors at the bottom of the pile, there are other sectors at the top that can equally pay the amount of money and we can balance the budget in that fashion.  I appeal to these Members to realise that it is not too late.  Deputy Gogarty and Deputy McDaid did not vote on the first vote, but a second vote is coming up in a short while.  I would hope they will either abstain or vote against this.  Others are questioning their consciences at this point.  They should continue to do so until such time as the vote, and they should listen to the arguments that have been put across the floor of this House.They must see how threadbare is the Government's argument on this issue.  This section is at the heart of what the Government is doing, namely, pulling the rug from the poorest in our society and making life miserable for them.  The Christmas bonus is gone and a reduction of approximately 6% will bring people on the poverty line below it, when we should be doing our best to ensure they are pulled up above the poverty line and assisted in whatever way possible.I make one final appeal.  I do not believe there is any hope of getting the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs to redress his position.  We heard him here this morning and he does not seem to care one way or the other.  Certainly, there are good people on the backbenches, Independents and those who are semi-detached — the strays, as the leader of the Labour Party described them this morning — and some among the Green Party who are deeply worried about this measure.  This is the opportunity for them to take a stand on this section, whatever about the other sections.  I appeal to them to do so when the vote arises.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	593	I suppose if I am sitting here, I am a target.  My name has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  Yes, it is hard for me, and I would hope for any other God-respecting humanist republican — you name it — to support measures that hurt the vulnerable.  Of course, it is hard for me.  It is hard for me to gratuitously insult many of my constituents who are public sector employees and tell them: "Listen, lads.  It is necessary.  I feel your pain but it is necessary".  To them, it comes across as baloney, insincerity, political rant.  We have had much of that in past the couple of days in this Chamber although I must acknowledge we have had much sincerity also.I will take at face value the sincerity with which the Deputies on the opposite side of the House have expressed themselves although I know also that perhaps some of their colleagues were more interested in point-scoring and political opportunism than sincerity.  If I was on the Opposition benches, not having access to the figures, not being involved in the negotiations for the programme for Government and not having been kept in the loop this year, which we certainly were not last year with the rushed budget, I would be clamouring for blood and pointing out the unfairness of this budget.  It would be highly disingenuous of me and totally insincere, therefore, to say anything other than that this is a grossly unfair section and that the Bill is grossly unfair.I have received God knows how many texts, including today, from constituents in both the public sector and those in receipt of social welfare.  They say it is a shame and a disgrace, and ask "How can you hurt vulnerable people?"  Unfortunately, this is what this debate is about.  The Labour Party says there is a radical alternative.  Those on the Government benches say there is no alternative.  I believe there was an alternative in our society and there may still be an alternative.  However, as far as this budget goes, there is not much room for manoeuvre.  That is the problem.  I stated on the record last night that approximately €3.2 billion is being paid in interest on our loans this year.  If nothing is done by 2013 it will go up to €11 billion, a quarter of our tax take.The Green Party argued for a number of things.  Personally, even though I  be shot by some sectors for saying so, I believe certain people over the age of 65, if social welfare is being cut, could also take a 1% or 2% cut, instead of the blind, the carers and other sectors.  That did not happen, a judgment call was made.  Some might say it was a cynical decision by Fianna Fáil to protect its electorate.  Others might say that the pensioners were hurt last year, as the protest showed, and we should not hurt them this year.  A cynic might say again that the pensioners can come out and protest whereas the more vulnerable cannot.I am trying to look at this objectively.  There are reasons for protecting our senior citizens.  People got on to me before the budget saying they did not care about the pain but they did not want their mother or father to suffer a cut in their pension.  There were reasons for that but the knock-on effect of not cutting pensions means the other areas of the welfare budget had to be cut instead.We in the Green Party argued for a reduction in the overall level of cuts.  I will not go into detail, I will leave that to someone else, but we succeeded in getting it reduced somewhat from what it might have been to the 4.1% it is now.  That was a trade off from various sectors.The trouble is, no matter where there is a trade-off, someone will get hurt.  If a relatively low income earner in the public sector is being levied with a 5% pay cut, if social welfare is not touched when that pay cut is brought in, all of a sudden that person would probably be better off leaving his job, even with the pension security.  If he has just started in the public sector and is on a low income, the pension is a long way off and he might say that this is a chance to get out if the offer comes for reductions in staff numbers.If pay is reduced in the public sector, social welfare must also be reduced and it has been reduced by less than the lowest earners in the public sector.  It hurts those on social welfare, and it certainly hurts those within the public sector, but if money is not taken out of the public sector, social welfare is increased and vice versa.We have had a debate about the rich needing to pay more, and I agree with that.  We argued in this budget and the Green Party is disappointed that a third rate of tax was not brought in this year, although we understand there is a commitment it may be brought in next year.  We are disappointed the PRSI levy was not introduced this year, because we argued vehemently for that as well.  We argued vehemently for many things, such as the introduction of a carbon tax and the protection of education and we got some of those things but we did not get everything.  Taken as a package, however, we could not ignore the reality that we must make €4 billion plus in savings or else the interest rates we pay on our overdraft will go up.I agree with the Minister for Finance on one point.  He was overly conservative on the application of additional taxes.  There is a strong case that if taxes are increased and revenue goes down and the €4 billion magic figure is not achieved, it is totally pointless.  I agree, but he was a little conservative in terms of getting rid of the loopholes and areas where people make savings on their tax liabilities.  More needs to be done and it needs to be done quickly.  I acknowledge the levies that came into force in April affected the higher earners far more while those on social welfare were affected less.Having said all that, I genuinely acknowledge the call to solidarity by Members on the Opposition benches and I take it as a sincere call.  Like everyone in this Chamber, I am proud to call myself a republican.  Far too often, however, republicanism in Ireland has been paddywhackery.  I do not want to go off on a tangent but I remember sitting in a pub once and when everyone was pissed out of their brains, and the rebel band was playing the national anthem at the end of the night, as a naive 16 year old, I sat down because I thought this was an insult to our national anthem.  Someone whacked me in the back of the head and asked if I was not proud to be Irish.  I said I was proud to be Irish which is why I sat down.It is like that now.  I am damn proud to be Irish.  I am not proud of what has happened, I am not proud of the fact the banks had to be bailed out, of the corruption and worship of mammon in this country that has brought us to this sorry state, I am not proud of that, colleagues,——

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	690	Section 4 is the core of the issue as it deals with the cuts of practically every level of social welfare being paid to people under 66 years.  We should remind ourselves who they are.  In the first instance they are the jobseekers, 420,000 of them now, most of whom were working two years ago.  They are not, therefore, a group of people who do not wish to work but simply people who lost their jobs.  They also include those people on disability benefits, those who are too sick to work, and their income will be cut.  Not only will their income be cut but they will be charged for their medicines and some of them are on nine or ten separate medicines a week.  They will pay 50 cent per item every time they are given a prescription.  This will be a significant additional burden on them.  The carer's allowance will be cut.  The allowance for the blind will be cut as will allowances for single parents and all the other types of payments.  I give full credit to the Government for increasing the amounts of money payable during the good times.  This is an historic occasion in this House.  A tiny amount of money was taken from pensioners by Ernest Blythe a long time before I was born.  It has stuck in the folk memory of people that a Government took one shilling from the old-age pensioners, and that is how Ernest Blythe is remembered.This budget, and this Minister in particular, will be remembered, for the fact that she has failed to find an alternative to taking money from the poorest people in society.  All parties in the House, right across the board, agreed there was a requirement to find about €4 billion to assist with the balancing of the books of this nation.  Everybody agreed that amount had to be found and everybody then had a responsibility to say how it would be found.  We brought forward our proposals; they were real, alternative proposals costed by the Department of Finance and presented.  Fine Gael did likewise.  None of those proposals suggested these cuts so there was an alternative to what the Minister did.  Two separate alternatives to find the €4 billion required were presented in this House.  It is nonsense, blather and rubbish to say there was no alternative.  I am sorry I have to do it this way.There were alternative sources of funding available to the Government if it wished to go after them.  One of the alternatives we suggested was that people earning more than €100,000 per year — such as Members of this House — should pay tax at 48% in the euro.  This was not accepted.  We had a list of other proposals that added up to more than the €4 billion and we were to spend an additional €1.2 billion on job creation.  That was our proposal.  I do not want to hear again from the Government, their spokespersons or their spokespersons in the media, who seemed to swallow the Government line, hook, line and sinker, that there was no alternative.  There were two very real alternatives, costed by the Department of Finance, put to this House by the two parties in Opposition and I will mention that Sinn Féin also put forward a proposal that was fully costed.  There were nuances of difference between them but one common element was that the poor were protected.  This is the common theme of the Opposition even though there are different ideologies in the Opposition.

I notice the Minister is not here in the Chamber for this very important part of her Bill.  She will go down in history as being the person who cut social welfare across the board and not just the shilling off the old-age pensioners.  This will create very severe hardship.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	694	People currently on social welfare are very poor.  A single person on social welfare, some of whom may be 50 years of age, have lost their jobs and are on €204 a week, will find their benefit reduced by a significant amount relative to them.  They will not receive any extra rent allowance because that is also being changed.  It will mean a net loss to them.  They live on loaves of bread and sausages; they do not buy fillet steaks because they cannot afford them.  Steak is not on the menu for them.  They will now be even poorer.  The most vulnerable people are the blind, the disabled and the handicapped and they will all suffer severely arising from this.I will contrast those we are arguing should have contributed with those whom the Government insist will contribute.  People on supplementary welfare allowance, which is the last safety net provided by Government for people to stop them going hungry and to ensure they have a roof or some form of shelter, will pay, whereas the banker whom we recently funded with taxpayers' money —  he is being paid out of the same kitty as the person on supplementary welfare allowance — thought he could not exist on €500,000 a year.  He will pay nothing.  That is what we are complaining about, the way the money was found.  I take these two extreme cases as an example of the people who will pay and the people who will not pay, to demonstrate the point clearly.It is a disgrace that the Government made a decision to target specifically and solely in this budget the poorest people in the country, the most vulnerable, the most in need and the people who are likely to suffer severely arising from the money that is being taken from them.  The really galling aspect for them, particularly many of the recently unemployed, is that they are being forced to pay for the near criminal activity of bankers and speculators —  in some cases, criminal activity — and the fact that the Government aided and abetted that activity by turning a blind eye, day in, day out, year in, year out, to their activities.I will touch on the reason the Minister did not comply with the requirement in the Cabinet handbook to produce the poverty-proofing of her proposals or why the Minister for Finance, who is primarily responsible, did not do so and ignored that requirement on him to do so.  The reason is plain as a pikestaff.  Because such a proofing would demonstrate clearly that this would severely damage poor people and cause additional poverty, he skipped that requirement.  That is the reason it is not included in the books we normally receive.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	708	I ask the Government and its spokespersons to stop suggesting they have ensured the vulnerable have been protected.  The vulnerable are being punished and will not be protected by these measures.  They have been targeted exclusively, while the rich, the well-off and those who caused the problem escape once again.  There are alternatives, which the Labour Party has outlined in detail.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I thank those Deputies who have raised genuine issues and I will address as many of them as I can.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Deputy McGinley referred to the half rate payment for carers.  The rate will be reduced to half the new rate of the carer's benefit.  Carers asked us not to abolish the half rate carer's allowance, as recommended in the McCarthy report.  While I understand that no one wants the payment to be reduced by €4.25 per week, carers are relieved that the scheme was not abolished.The case raised by Deputy Crawford provides me with an opportunity to highlight one example which could be useful to Deputies.  A widow with three children who works part time and is in receipt of the contributory pension would receive €291 per week.  Assuming she is working 19 hours per week on the minimum wage, she would receive a further €163 per week.  On this income, with three children, she would qualify for the family income supplement under which she would receive a further €149 per week.  This would make a significant difference to her income as she would receive a total of €725 per week, of which €562 would be paid by the State.   I am not trying to justify a cut in her social welfare payment.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13519	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	714	On a point of order, if one is shoving somebody——
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	715	That is not a point of order.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to ask questions when the Minister concludes.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The purpose of the family income supplement is to support people on low incomes and acknowledge that they make a contribution through participation in the workforce but need to be supported by virtue of being on lower incomes than others.  The case I cited is a good example of a person who can receive this support.  A widow with an income of €725 per week would receive €562 from the State.Deputy Sherlock asked whether there would be a pro rata decrease for young people.  Given that young people living at home are means tested on the basis of their parents’ income, there will be a pro rata decrease, with a minimum entitlement.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	719	Deputy Ferris who focused on farmers and the farm assist scheme will have noted that a new environmental scheme has been introduced.  The scheme, which has been welcomed by farmers, is designed to support farmers and keep them where they are.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	720	The Minister has her wires crossed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Deputy Stanton asked about the policy on young carers.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs is working on this issue.  As we did not have empirical evidence on the number of carers, the issue is the subject of a study.Deputy Morgan asked about reductions in jobseeker's allowance and welfare dependency.  Family income supplement, which bridges the gap between welfare and work, was introduced to minimise welfare dependency.  This was also the reason we compensated recipients of family income supplement and social welfare for the reduction in child benefit.Deputy Michael D'Arcy indicated that the Estimate does not refer to family resource centres.  The centres are not a specific heading in the Estimate because they are included under the Family Support Agency.  Funding for services provided by family resource centres has not been reduced.  Funding for the support agencies, of which there are four, has been cut by €2 million and plans to expand them and increase their number will not proceed in the next couple of years.  While we will cut back at that end, the services provided on the ground by 107 family resource centres will not be affected by the measures.It was obvious from Deputy Lee's contribution in the House and on national media last night that he had not read the proposals on young people in the budget or the legislation.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	722	Does the Minister propose to give the Deputy a lecture in economics?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	723	Two statements the Deputy made in the House need to be corrected.  First, he indicated that a young person who worked from the age of 17 to 24 years would only receive €150 per week.  This is wrong because a person with a work record would receive the full adult rate of jobseeker's benefit.  If the person subsequently dropped to jobseeker's allowance, he or she would continue to receive the full adult rate.  Second, Deputy Lee stated that a young married couple with children would only receive €100 or €150 per week.  That is wrong because anyone with dependent children will receive the full payment.I am pleased Deputy McEntee raised the issue of deaf people.  One could conclude from the contributions of Deputies that blindness was the only disability.  While blindness is a terrible disability, in fairness to people with other disabilities I am glad Deputy McEntee specifically referred to deaf people.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Unfortunately, those who receive disability or invalidity payments will be affected by the cuts.  Deputies have asked how much it would have cost if we had not reduced payments to those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  The cost of not doing so would have been almost €108 million.  It would have been necessary to find this expenditure in other Departments or in my Department's spending.

They want and need these services — Deputy Crawford is nodding his head — because they are very important to people with disability.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	730	They are very angry.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	733	An additional €10 million has been provided to deliver more home care packages.  The choice facing us was whether to reduce payments, bad as such a step is, or place the burden on the Department of Health and Children.  I believe that if one reduced services by more — there are many with disabilities who would agree——
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	734	That was the Government's choice.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	735	——it would have impacted upon such people more seriously.  I agree with the remarks of Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the salaries of some people in the agencies to which he referred.  The Government does not set those salaries.  I fully agree it is outrageous for the head of a body such as Coillte or the ESB to receive a salary of €400,000 or more.  It goes against everything that people in this House attempt to do and everything to which people throughout the country are trying to adapt.  I trust they will take some leadership as well, in the same way — let me put this on the record — as those of us in the House, the Taoiseach and Ministers.  We are very well paid and I recognise as much.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	737	That is the reason we took a voluntary 10% reduction last year.  Under legislation this year, we will take a 15% cut.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	739	This 15% cut is formal, legal and permanent.  There is a substantial difference between permanent legislation and a voluntary contribution.  It is true to say the Taoiseach is taking a 20% cut and Minister's are taking a 15% cut.  We are not making anything of it.  I am not trying to excuse——

It was very important that we did that to give the type of leadership that the country needs and that is what we have attempted to show in this regard.Certain Members have criticised us for making these choices.  It was not a case of trying to generate more in revenue and therefore we could cut back on expenditure.  In attempting to take out €4 billion from Exchequer spending, it had to come from our expenditure.

That was imposed on income earners in a very progressive way up to a high limit.

It is not true to say that one can concentrate on a tiny group of people and hope to save €4 billion.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	750	That is not true.

The extras would have imposed more hardship on more people.  Let us consider the respite care grant.  It has grown from €245 to €1,700 and a change to that would have had a greater financial impact on thousands more people than simply cutting the rate.  As a Minister it would have been easier to stand and refrain from cutting the rate and simply cut the grant.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	779	Words comes cheap.  The Minister continues to engage in the spin in which all members of the Government have been involved in recent weeks. The Minister will be judged by her actions.  Her actions show clearly that she set out deliberately to hit the weakest in society.  Rather than protecting the vulnerable, she has protected the rich.  The Minister has protected millionaires.  Those people referred to previously who earn vast salaries will not pay one extra cent in tax, nor will those who can avail of various property reliefs.  None of the property reliefs have been affected although the Government could have raised €430 million through such a measure.  Those with vast pension schemes that attract tax relief on more than €5 million remain untouched, as do those that earn €300,000, €400,000, €500,000 and €600,000 or more per year.The Minister set out very clearly to target the weakest in society such as those dependent on social welfare.  As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, should be ashamed of herself because she has done nothing to protect those people who look to her to provide some social protection.  The Minister should stop trying to misrepresent the situation.  It is clear she had choices.  A fair budget could have been introduced which could have ensured those who had most would contribute something to solve the problems.  She could have protected those at the lowest levels but failed to do so.  She chose to hit the weak and those dependent on social welfare and chose to ignore those who have very large incomes and a good deal of wealth.  The Minister decided to leave them untouched and she will be judged by her actions, not by her untruthful words.I wish to put a question to the Minister.  During the last vote she had an opportunity to ask the Minister for Finance why he did not produce a statement on the poverty proofing of the budget, as required under the national anti-poverty strategy and in accordance with the Cabinet handbook.  Will the Minister provide an answer on that matter now?  Was a statement produced and, if not, why not?  Does the Minister believe the Government can simply disregard the rules and regulations in place which require it to pay some attention to the impact of its decisions on the weakest?

However, the main issue I highlighted was the cost of administration in each Department.  Some costs have gone up, including those of the Minister's Department.  I appreciate there are more staff and a good deal more work to do now in that Department.  However, when the administration costs of the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources increase, it makes my blood boil to hear from some quarters that there is no alternative.  The Minister is here representing the Government.  There is a reduction of 0.6% in administration costs, but the Minister is taking money from the blind and from carers.  Where was the reform the Minister should have been spearheading to try to ensure those people were protected?  Was there any previous attempt to reduce administration costs?  It is a fair question.  The cost of administration in 2009 was €4.465 billion, but the book of Estimates we received on Wednesday projected the cost for 2010 at €4.435 billion, a reduction of a little over 0.6%.  Yet the Minister is cutting allowances for carers, blind people and widows.  I would like an explanation from the Minister.

I have been speaking to industry sources and small businesses — people who are hoping to get to Christmas.  I have been involved in several cases recently in which businesses have been trying to prevent the sheriff from entering their premises and persuade the Revenue Commissioners to deal with them.  There is a strong and forceful attitude within the Revenue Commissioners at present.  Last Sunday's TV documentary "The Sheriff and Me" was not a true reflection of what is going on because the sheriff was portrayed as a very nice man.  He probably is a very nice man, but the programme did not show what is happening out there.  The Minister has made provision for an unemployment level of 500,000 this time next year.  What contingency plans does she have?

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	797	My point relates directly to what the Minister has just said.  I will be brief and I hope my point is understood.  The whole thrust of our approach is that in the present circumstances, as many Deputies have mentioned, the Minister had an opportunity of recasting our approach towards social protection.  I have said with regard the budget and other matters that we should attempt to establish a floor beneath which people would not be allowed to fall.  I argued that strongly from the point of view of a citizenship model.  That would have made the participation of citizens within this State, in terms of inclusiveness, welfare and safety, independent of fluctuations in economic growth.  It is perfectly respectable for the Minister to differ with me on that issue, but she cannot just say there is no other way.  That was said by one of the most reprehensible participants in political life of the last century, Margaret Thatcher.  There are other ways.If the Minister had taken that approach, she could have defined it in the following way.  Any Minister for social welfare or policy makes a choice among three models.  One is the distribution of whatever is available from surplus.  The second is payments related to whatever a person has earned during his or her lifetime.  The third model is one in which we consistently try to redistribute opportunities and security to those who are less well off.  This is a redistributive model.  There is no point in suggesting that any of us is lesser in our economic probity by simply advancing that model.  I do it for a specific reason.  The Minister gave us a precis of how we came to be here in terms of the public finances.  However, we must consider the history of a series of budgets that provided tax reliefs.  The bottom 20% of taxpayers used 1% of the tax reliefs, while 77% of the top tax reliefs — on such things as spas and car parks — were used by people on incomes of more than €100,000, while more than half, at approximately 60%, were used by people earning more than €200,000.  Those budgets provided massive opportunities for those with high disposable income.What about the notion that the poor dears are shrinking in number and there are not that many of them to give us more money?  The Minister for Finance said in his budget statement that he was doing something very radical by giving net high income earners — as adjudged by the Revenue Commissioners — an effective tax rate of 30%.  He is doing this on the basis that people will throw millions in the faces of poor people around the country — he is simply saying that philanthropy will do what the State will not do.  These people will have to pay €200,000.  It is time to put a stop to this nonsense.  We heard from the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, that there was no money out there.  What about all the money that was lifted out of the economy and invested abroad?  What about all the money that was forked into pension funds for people earning a couple of hundred thousand?I agree with one thing the Minister said.  She said it was obscene for people to be paid €400,000, and I agree with her.  Therefore, I find it obscene that people feel it is acceptable to earn a similar amount as a part-time non-executive director of a bank.  We are agreed on that.  However, it is simply not true to say there are no riches out there that could have been accumulated.  There could have been a rake-back from those who enjoyed property reliefs worth €400 million.  The Minister can defend her position as much as she wishes, but she cannot say there was no alternative.  There was an alternative.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	798	There is.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	799	There was an alternative.  The Government could have pursued this money through taxation or by reconfiguration with regard to forms of capital expenditure.  However, the most important thing of all, which must be admitted even by people on the Government side and those who support the Government, is that there was an opportunity for an entirely new departure in social protection.  Let the record state that when we were saying Ireland had the second highest incomes in the world and the best incomes in the European Union, we were never above the bottom three in the EU in terms of social protection.  There was an opportunity.I ask the Minister not to tell us there was no alternative.  There was.  It was costed and documents were printed by different parties — the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin.  The Minister cannot use the Bill to try to extend the nonsense that was spoken during the budget.  There was an alternative.  We can make arrangements for after Christmas if required.  When the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, says the worst is over, what he is really trying to say is that we are going back to the old game all over again.  The old game is over.  Our function on the social welfare Bill is to make the case for the poorest people and make sure they are not the ones who carry the burden.  That is why I wish we were not only on section 4.  We must get on to all the other sections which deal with appliances and so on — all the basic things that people need to live decently, which are being attacked in this Bill.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I thank the Deputy.  I ask speakers to confine themselves to section 4.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The Minister said there are no alternatives, but there are.  Fifty percent of the McCarthy recommendations were implemented in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but only half that number were implemented in other Departments.  Thus, there was ample room for savings.  Only €55 million was achieved through taxes on the rich, one twelfth of what Fine Gael had proposed.In regard to the widow about whom the Minister spoke, how much better off will that woman be if she works for 18 hours per week?  What is the shortfall in regard to fraud this year?  Is it not the case that the shortfall is in excess of the €108 million the Minister will raise from the cuts being imposed on the most vulnerable in society?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	802	This is the key section because it deals with the rates for social assistance payments and it covers a wide range of issues.  The Minister said she had been in contact with the disability groups.  I do not know if she had the time since the Budget Statement to read what Inclusion Ireland said in regard to the cuts.  It stated that it regards cuts to people on disability allowance and carer's allowances as an attack on the direct living standards and the quality of life of people with disability and that it is also at variance with the national disability strategy — which is often spoken about by the Government as evidence of its commitment to people with disabilities — and that the moratorium on recruitment and other cuts in the health care budget will impact directly on the services people with disabilities can expect to receive.  It further stated that in addition, cuts to agencies which protect people with disability and prevent them from being discriminated against on the grounds of disability, such as the Equality Tribunal and the Health and Information Quality Authority, will further disadvantage people with disability.The cuts affect the jobseeker's allowance.  More than any other group in society, young people are being made unemployed and are starting to become dependent on social welfare.  The National Youth Council of Ireland distributed a fact sheet in regard to the budget cuts.  It stated that 74,100 young people under 25 years of age are out of work.  The figure is probably higher because that figure is from September.  It stated that youth unemployment has trebled since the fourth quarter of 2006, that Ireland has the second highest youth unemployment in western Europe and 51,700 young people out of work are aged between 20 and 24.In what she has presented, the Minister is saying these people wish to become welfare dependent.  That is not true because young people want work.  Proof of that is the 60% increase in the number contacting FÁS this year as compared to 2008.  Young people also want work experience but the Government only announced 2,000 places on a workplace scheme in April.  Some 500 of those places were supposed to be ring-fenced for those under 25.  That was welcomed at the time.  The workplace programme scheme is not working.  Only 129 people have been placed.  That amounts to one workplace placement place for every 3,282 people on the live register.Many young people have just completed college or will be due to complete it in June of this year.  They are already well educated.  They want work experience but it is not there nor are the jobs.  To penalise them because the Government cannot get its act together and create jobs is the biggest scandal in this budget and that is why these rates of payments are a scandal.We are differentiating on the basis of age.  It would be interesting if somebody took a case on the ground of age discrimination in regard to the payments.  This section which sets the rates is the most odious of all.  I would like a lot more time devoted to this Bill in order that we could tease out some of the other odious parts.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	803	Being young is not a safeguard against poverty.  The Minister has pulled the rug from under many young people.  I have received many telephone calls from young people in my constituency and outside it who are very well qualified, received a third level education and graduated but who cannot find employment.  Many of them are in a dire situation because they are paying back debts incurred during their years of study.  The Minister must protect those people who have done their utmost to find work.  What this budget has done is morally wrong.I would like to hear the Minister's views on reinstating the community employment schemes.  They were a safety net for many people in bygone years.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	804	The Deputy should stick to section 4.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I refer to widows under 66 years.  It has always astonished me that somebody who finds herself a widow at a young age, in particular if she has children, does not get secondary benefits.  Secondary benefits would be a huge advantage.  For most women or, indeed, men with two or three children who find themselves in this situation, child care is not an option nor is going out to work until the children are a little bit older.  Secondary benefits in such cases would be a huge advantage.Many people over 66 years retain the widow's pension rather than take up the old age pension.  They get the secondary benefits at that stage but I cannot understand how we can differentiate in terms of age when the younger widow or widower would benefit most.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	807	A few years ago, we could never have foreseen the type of budget introduced on Wednesday.  As a member of a Government party, it does not give me any joy or satisfaction to see social welfare payments being reduced.  There have been very generous increases in social welfare payments in recent years and people in receipt of them have become accustomed to increases.Were there alternatives?  We live in a small country with more than 2 million people in receipt of some form of social welfare payment and where social welfare accounts for 33% of total Government expenditure in a year.  That gives some indication of the amount of money we are paying in social welfare each week.   The Minister and the Government were faced with a very difficult choice.If one looks at people's habits, three or four years ago, they were saving approximately 2% of their disposable income but this year, it will have increased to 12%.  It is purely out of fear of the future.  People have little confidence in the future and are saving money because they do not know how rainy the rainy day will be.  The Government must restore confidence at home in order to encourage people to spend and invest money.  I know that is not possible in some cases.  Equally, it is important to instil confidence in the people who lend us money, that is, that we are in charge of our destiny, we have a plan in place and we will be able to honour any debts which accrue.

I appreciate the comments of people coming from various perspectives and taking the time to consider all the elements of this legislation properly, which is what we are here to do this afternoon.  People were here until 11 p.m. last night and were not disruptive, and those who were here spoke on behalf of the various constituent groups being affected by this legislation.  That is important.I did not answer a question from Deputy D'Arcy on the administrative budget.  The administrative budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is 0.51% of total expenditure and we aim to keep it as low as possible.  The same goes for other Departments but the administration of other Departments is also tied to the public pay sector, which will be affected.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	833	A number of issues have been raised and there is no point in just talking about the overall economic position when we are dealing with specifics.  Structural change had to be brought about, which meant expenditure had to be reduced, and that would have a bearing next year and the year after.  It is not just a simple case of bringing all this in with revenue.  We had to reduce expenditure across Departments.This is about opportunities and security, and it concerns giving those young people hope for the future.  There will not be jobs, opportunity or security for those young people unless we get this country's finances right.  That is what we are endeavouring to do in this budget, although we appreciate the difficulties that has caused for the significant number of people who will feel its impact.Deputy Kathleen Lynch has a genuine interest in many different issues surrounding disability and all welfare recipients.  I respect that.  The idea of giving more people secondary benefits is curious when there is much evidence showing that secondary benefits cause people who might be in a position to get off welfare not to want to get off it.  Nobody will say that the rates will keep people on welfare but when welfare recipients know they can get household benefits, free travel, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement they can become trapped.I am not sure that extending secondary benefits to more people will help them to break aware from the welfare system, although it will assist financially.  On the other hand, a person could be on the widow's contributory pension and be able to work anyway.  I fully appreciate the issues involved for widows.We are going back around the houses with the other issues brought up.  Deputy Tom Sheahan asked about contingency.  The figures for the Department were worked out on the basis of 460,000 people unemployed, on average.  On the one hand we are anticipating that, unfortunately, approximately 70,000 more people will lose their jobs but all the evidence indicates that the live register has stabilised.  We were in a horrific position last January when 1,000 people per day were losing their jobs.  I am sure Deputy Sheahan will be well able to ask his own questions.Fortunately the position has now stabilised because that was an horrific position for everybody involved.  The average figure for next year has been revised downwards.  It is anticipated that if growth returns to the country in the second half of next year, employment will be a bit slower to follow.  Notwithstanding the cuts being made in the budget, there is an additional allowance of €676 million in this Department.  God forbid, if there should be any increased demand, the budget will have to grow because these are demand-led schemes.  That is our best estimate.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	843	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, lines 21 to 24, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:"(b) in section 142A (inserted by section 6(c) of the Act of 2009)—(i) in subsection (1)(a), by substituting “22” for “20”,(ii) by substituting the following paragraph for subsection (4)(a):"(a) the period of interruption of employment commenced on or before 30 December 2009 and where, in the period prior to that date, the claimant was not a person to whom this section applied,”,and(iii) in subsection (4)(d), by substituting “22” for “20”,”.In order to incentivise young jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and to try to avoid them becoming welfare dependent from a young age, sections 6 and 13 of the Bill provide for reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance to people aged 20 to 24, inclusive.  The rate of jobseeker's allowance for new claims is being reduced to €100 per week for 20 to 21 year olds and €150 per week for those aged 22 to 24, inclusive, who are not in training or education.  The basic rates of supplementary welfare allowance for new claims for those under the age of 25 are also being reduced to ensure that people affected by the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance do not have recourse to a basic social welfare top-up, the net effect of which would be to negate the jobseeker's allowance measure.The purpose of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 is to ensure that existing 18 and 19 year olds in receipt of the reduced rate jobseeker's allowance of €100 will continue to receive this reduced rate on reaching age 20, if they are still unemployed.

As I mentioned earlier, Fine Gael has put forward detailed proposals for getting these people back into work.  However, my point is that, when the Minister for Finance addressed the House on Wednesday, he stated these reduced payments would apply to new applicants only.  This Minister is now telling us that is not the case and that people who are already signing on the live register who are under 20 will also be penalised.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I am not saying that because they will receive more money when they are 22.  They will move from the rate of €100 to €150.  However, they will be a new 22 year old at that stage.  At ages 18 to 21 they will get €100 and at 22 to 24 they will get €150, unless they are participating in education and training.  What this amendment allows is that somebody who is already on the €100 rate at 18 and 19 will not move on to the top rate at the age of 20, but continue on €100.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The Labour Party is opposed to this amendment.  We are very much in favour of young people having access to training, education and work opportunities. We do not believe any young person should go directly from school on to the dole.  That is our view and we feel that many other opportunities should be provided for them to increase their chances of being able to secure employment.Whatever about the original thinking behind the approach last April, what has happened in practice is a matter of serious concern.  When these changes came in last April for people under 20, it was portrayed at the time as a reasonable proposal that a young person who refused training or work placements would have their payment cut.  However, the reality was different.  It was a unilateral decision to cut jobseeker's payment for all those under 20.  The Minister is now proposing to extend that to those under 22 and to reduce it for those up to 25.  That would be fine if there were training and educational opportunities available to people.  However, there is nothing like enough places available.  Of all the under 20s who had been claiming jobseeker's allowance since April, 74% are still on the reduced rate, so these people have not managed to get a training or education place.  Of the remaining 26%, many of them would not come into the bracket because they have dependants, so much less than 20% of the under 20s have been accommodated on a training course.  It is not progress to force people in their late teens or early 20s to live on €100 per week.  In the case of people who are living at home, it could be a lot less than that.The figures have shown that the State is not in a position to provide the necessary training courses.  We are not prepared to accept a proposal to extend that penalty of a half-rate jobseeker's payment to people in their early 20s.  There has been a big switch to short-term training.  FÁS provides many short courses lasting one, two or three weeks.  A person might get onto a course that lasts a few weeks.  He or she gets the full rate, the course comes to an end and he or she goes back onto €100 per week.  Nobody can provide that person with another training course.What happens to a 21 year old, well qualified graduate who comes out of college and cannot obtain employment?  It would be fine if there was plenty of employment available and the problem was that people were not taking the jobs that are available.  However, that is not the problem because there are no jobs for young people.  The Minister should speak to constituents who have had the soul destroying experience of handing in their CVs doing everything they can to get a job, but the jobs just are not there.  A person comes out of college with a good degree but has no chance of getting a job.  He or she is hanging around waiting for something, because there is no training available.  What kind of training will be provided to somebody who has a very good honours degree?  Can meaningful and relevant training be provided to a person like that?  Can it be provided over a number of years until the person reaches 25, during which time he or she is expected to live on €100 per week?This measure is a kick in the teeth to our young people who have worked hard through school and college to get good degrees.  The Government is telling them that there is no place in Ireland for them at the moment and that they would be better off emigrating.  That is the wrong message for us to be sending out to our young people, which is why the Labour Party is rejecting this proposal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	857	As a former múinteoir, the Minister will know that many young people, particularly those between 18 and 23 who participate in a FÁS course, have a very high drop out rate, and many of them have serious literacy and numeracy problems.  Putting up a barrage of so-called courses will be of no benefit to many of these young males.  The Minister should consider putting forward aggressive, constructive courses of 12 to 13 weeks' duration, containing classes of no more than 14 and which deal with their particular educational problems.  There is no point in bringing them to a short-term course just because they are young people.  They have particular problems with numeracy and literacy, and the Minister could avail of the many young teachers who are qualified to teach those courses.  These courses could be better managed by FÁS than NALA, which might not have the capacity to deal with that range.  This is a socially constructive suggestion.  I know many of these young people and they have problems that will not be sorted out by a course for the sake of having a course.The Minister should look at the statistics for young males between the age of 18 and 23 who drop out.  The capacity exists to have really good, aggressive courses that deal with their educational problems.  There are qualified teachers hanging around unemployed and they could usefully do this in a very constructive fashion.  It could be managed under the aegis of outreach courses at FÁS.  If the Minister takes the time to talk to many of those directors around the country who do a first class job, they will tell her to do exactly what I am putting forward.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13519	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	858	There are approximately 69,500 people aged under 24 on the live register.  The Minister for Finance claimed in his speech that he will make 26,000 training places available.  Therefore, we cannot force all of those people into training schemes because there are simply not enough places.  Many of those are graduates who will be over qualified for the type of training places I imagine will be envisaged under this proposal.We are now in a situation where parents, especially those in the public sector who are in the €30,000-45,000 income bracket and who have seen their incomes reduced, will see a further squeeze on their finances if they have children who have recently graduated living at home who may not fit the type of training schemes that are envisaged.  Under section 3, the Minister has already acknowledged there will be a pro rata decrease, depending on means.  I understand that the minimum amount for which somebody living at home could be eligible is about €30.  That is pocket money and it reduces the dignity of people who qualify from third level education and who continue to live at home.There are over 69,000 people aged under 24 on the live register and a significant number of them are graduates who cannot get a job.  The logical conclusion — I say this rationally and without emotion — is that many of the people to whom I refer will be obliged to migrate to some other part of the world to obtain employment.In the past ten years, Australia was the new Klondike and it was a good place for people in their early 20s to go.  However, this choice is no longer available because the employment situation in Australia is not as good as previously.  It appears Canada is the new Klondike for many people.  However, employment opportunities there will also soon dry up.  As a result, a significant number of people under the age of 25 will be obliged to reside at home with their parents.  These individuals will be obliged to survive on incomes of €30 or €40 per week and this will place an increased burden on their parents.What we needed in the budget was some degree of programming which would ensure that people would not be obliged to take up positions on Mickey Mouse courses in order to maintain their social welfare payments.  The Government should have put in place a proper, well thought out, structured programme of internships.  This would have allowed the people to whom I refer to use the knowledge and qualifications they possess.The Minister should think about things in a more lateral fashion.  If she is going to put in place schemes, these should be properly thought out.  People's entitlements should not be cut until they can be given positions on meaningful courses or be provided with internships.  If they are afforded such opportunities, it will assist them in getting back into the workplace.  My party is opposed to this amendment because it will place further hardship on low-paid parents whose sons and daughters under the age of 24 continue to live at home.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The saddest testimony to the mismanagement of the economy in recent years is the fact that 83,362 people under the age of 25 are unemployed.  In November 2007, some 62 people under the age of 25 in my home town of Macroom were listed as unemployed.  By November 2009, this had risen to 287 — a 362% increase over two years.  In Newmarket, which is in my constituency, in November 2007, some 73 people under the age of 25 were listed as unemployed.  By November 2009, the figure was 313 — an increase of 328%.  They are real people, with real hopes, aspirations and dreams.  They want to settle down, start families and get on with their lives.  That which is proposed in the Bill will oblige them to put their lives on hold.The budget does not offer these people an overall framework in the context of advancing their livelihoods or improving their economic or social circumstances.  That is a sad indictment of the Government's mismanagement of the economy and of the Minister's lack of vision.  The Minister has an inability to think outside the box.  She is obliged to cut her budget but there is no cross-departmental approach involving her Department and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science to the problems to which I refer.Many of the 83,000 people under the age of 25 who are unemployed were seduced by the money that was available on building sites.  They left school and did not pursue third level options and, as Deputy Kenny stated, they are now in desperate need of retraining.  I do not have any confidence in FÁS's capacity to provide these people with training opportunities.  That organisation is bereft of any credibility.  This is particularly disappointing because we need an organisation such as FÁS to step into the breach.  Identifying training needs and directing people to FÁS will not achieve the kind of fundamental reskilling required by those who were formerly employed on building sites.There will be many third level graduates who will have no alternative but to emigrate.  The loss to our economy, which has helped educate these people to a very high standard, will be significant.  There is a need to think outside the box in the context of offering incentives to companies which might offer these people internships.  Perhaps financial assistance could be provided and these individuals could continue to draw jobseeker's allowance, which could be topped up by an employer.  Local authorities could provide young graduate engineers and architects with opportunities.  There is a major deficit of architectural flair among our various local authorities.  The graduates to whom I refer could be given some basic work experience by the authorities and this would then assist them in gaining more permanent job opportunities.The budget, which lacks vision, does not offer these people any hope.  That is the real tragedy with regard to where matters stand in the context of unemployment.  Fine Gael published a range of initiatives which, if adopted, would take up to 50,000 young people off the live register in the coming 12 months.  I regret to say that the Minister's lack of vision will consign the energy, abilities and dreams of these people to the dustbin for a further 12 months.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I am my party's spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment and for the past number of months I have been exhorting the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take proactive and positive steps in respect of this matter.  On all occasions, the Tánaiste indicated to me that she was working in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science to see what could be done.  However, the budget does not appear to bestow any great credence to that assertion.  The budget contains many references to places on courses, etc.  However, most courses are bursting at the seams.  How, therefore, are we supposed to get people back to work or encourage them to retrain or return to education?It is peculiar that, in the context of the €50 and €100 reductions in weekly income, this is the one area in which the Government wielded the axe in a manner that was even more vicious than suggested in the McCarthy report.  Why was that the case?It would have been better if the Minister had, in conjunction with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, reconsidered the position with regard to the back to work and back to education allowances.  In addition, the Government should do away with the nonsense of putting in place bureaucratic hurdles which prevent people from taking up training or educational opportunities for three or six months.  If a person wishes to return to education, he or she should be allowed to do so.  He or she should not be obliged to jump through hoops or be made to sign on for social welfare before being able to avail of a training or educational opportunity.  All the obstacles should be removed.  Repackaging the old solutions is a waste of time because circumstances have changed.Ireland has the second highest rate of unemployment among young people in western Europe.  One third of men under the age of 25 and one quarter of all young people are unemployed.  I cannot see how the proposal before the House is going to help.  It would be fine and dandy if opportunities were available.  Where are those opportunities?  How can people obtain meaningful training opportunities?  It is no use putting someone in a room, giving them a telephone and explaining how to make or receive a call or record a message.  The training opportunities offered to young people must be meaningful in nature and must lead on to something positive.  We must also find a way to allow people to participate in education.  The Government's response to the current difficulties has been completely inadequate.  In the context of scale, it has been deficient and from the perspective of effort, it has been abysmal.  As Deputy Sherlock stated, the Government lacks imagination and vision.  Both of these are critical.The Labour Party brought forward a document relating to this matter.  The Labour Party finance spokesperson, Deputy Joan Burton, will speak further on this.  We spent ages trying to get agreement for graduate and back to work schemes and internships at local authorities and public bodies.  I raised this at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We invest a major amount of money in our education system and produce top class graduates.  I spoke to someone yesterday about fourth level education, an area that might become very productive.  What do we do with these people?This proposal is a charter for emigration.  I can name areas affected in my constituency.  My uncles said the one thing they got from de Valera was a one way ticket and they never came back after leaving in 1949, 1953, 1954 and 1956.  This is a reversion to a tried and trusted policy when there is a problem.  It is made so difficult to remain that people emigrate.  We lose a generation of people with skills and education.  If we are to get out of the problem we are in, education is the key and these people will be part of the rejuvenation.  For the sake of a measly few euro, we could sink.  It is time we got something going in this regard.Those who complete college need work experience.  If one has completed a degree, one either progresses to a masters degree or needs work experience to progress to a job.  These people do not need further education and training but they will now be left in limbo.  At the end of 2006, there were only 24,000 categorised as unemployed young people.  There has been more than a trebling of the figure.  Last April, 2,000 places in the workplace scheme were announced.  Of these, 500 were for people under 25.  That was welcome because it was a recognition of the situation.  However, the programme never got out of the traps.  It was like a greyhound that lay down in that trap when one expected it to cross the line 30 seconds later.  Nothing happened.  By 1 December, approximately 129 people had taken part in it.  Deputy Upton knows more than me about this subject, having worked in the higher education sector.  That amounts to one work placement for every 3,300 people on the live register.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I have become allergic to the use by Members on the Government benches of the terminology of the vulnerable and the weakest in our society.  Everything in this budget is driven in the opposite action.  The weakest and most vulnerable are the victims of this budget.  I do not want to hear the terms used again because I cannot buy into the philosophy put forward.I calculate that there are approximately 3,000 people under the age of 25 on the live register in the constituency of Dublin South-Central.  I base this information on figures from the National Youth Council of Ireland and extrapolating from the three social welfare offices that serve the constituency.  The constituency has been badly served for many years.  In recent times, there was a lift and matters were moving forward.  Better education facilities were provided.  If we now have 3,000 young people hanging about with no opportunities, any progress made will be reversed.Regarding graduate placements and training, what are the retraining opportunities for a young architect of 23 years of age with a good degree?  Is the person to be retrained as a chef or a carpenter?  There seems to be a lack of fit between the people in need of retraining and the training opportunities available.  It does not add up, nor does it make sense.  There is no thinking outside the box, as another speaker commented, to try to find appropriate training and education provision for young people in that age bracket.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	862	One of the major issues in this Bill concerns young people and discrimination on the basis of age.  It is clear this is a new measure in the social welfare Bill.  The treatment of people between 20 and 25 is based purely on age.  The Equality Act is key legislation.  Under this legislation, it is not legal to discriminate on the basis of age unless one can find objective justification for it.  Has the Government taken legal opinion on the issue of objective justification for discriminating between a 24 year old and a 25 year old in respect of jobseeker's allowance?  Will the Minister for Social and Family Affairs publish the legal opinion highlighting the objective justification for this discrimination?  Can the Minister assure us this is not illegal?  This comes from EU law.I refer to our Constitution, under which all people should be held equal in the eyes of the law.  This focuses on the differences in capacity, whether physical, moral or of social function.  It is conceivable that the State can differentiate if some justification can be found in respect of differences in capacity physical, moral or social function.  In respect of this discriminatory legislation, has the Minister received any legal opinion on the differences in the moral, physical and social functions of a 24 year old and a 25 year old?  On what basis is it conceivable that the differentiation between someone who is 24 and someone who is 25 can be made on the basis of fairness, justice and our Constitution?  It strikes at the heart of fairness and it undermines the thrust of the whole social welfare Bill.  Suddenly, this year, one can say there is a difference between two people of different ages, whether 21 and 25, 22 and 25 and most particularly 24 and 25.  Is there some change in physical appearance or skill?  All are fully qualified and most likely have experience.  They have lots of things going on in their lives and most likely they have the same pain and sense of letdown as victims of the economic collapse, due to the economic decisions of the Government in recent years and the way it blew the boom, something to which these young people were not party.  In what way is it conceivable to find objective justification for the discriminatory legislation to make a distinction between these people?  This requires an answer before anyone can proceed to vote for this legislation.

Dar ndóigh, beidh níos mó as obair amach anseo.  Chonaic mé fógra tamall ó shin agus chonaic mé go bhfuil níos mó daoine á chur as obair i gCaisleán an Bharraigh inniu mar tá comhlacht mór ag dúnadh agus ag cur 65 duine ar an scrap heap sin, an dole.  Déan buille faoi thuairim cé mhéad daoine ina measc siúd atá faoi 24.  An mbeidh siadsan cláraithe mar dhaoine dífhostaithe roimh an spriocdáta.  Cé mhéad díobh a bheidh thíos leis maidir leis an liúntas toisc an cinneadh atá glactha ag an Rialtas?Aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Lee.  Luaigh mé níos luaithe gur shíl mé go raibh idirdhealú mídhleathach á dhéanamh anseo ó thaobh aois de.  Ba mhaith liom dá bhfeicfimis duine óg ag tógaint cáis i gcoinne an Rialtais de bharr go bhfuil an idirdhealú seo á dhéanamh.  Más saoránach duine agus aois 18 sroichte aige nó aici, is saoránach an duine sin le cearta uile iomlán an saoránaigh, seachas ceann nó dhó.  Mar shampla, ní féidir a bheith mar Uachtarán na tíre seo mura bhuil aois 35 sroichte ag duine.  Seachas sin, níl aon eolas agam faoi aon idirdhealú eile a déantar i gcóras an Stáit maidir le daoine atá idir 18 agus 24.I am reiterating what I said earlier so I will not go on for too long because there are other matters to discuss.  Deputy Upton mentioned the figures for Dublin South Central.  There are 918 such people in Ballyfermot alone because the dole office there deals only with Dublin 10.  There are no jobs in Ballyfermot and there are no additional training places there.  Every community employment course or job initiative programme that was available is over-subscribed.  Where are these 918 people, and every young person who will become unemployed after 1 January, to go?  They will not have places because the Government schemes have not delivered education, retraining or work placement.I agree with those Deputies who mentioned graduates.  People will qualify next June as engineers, scientists, physicians, computer technicians and what-not and there will be nothing for them to do.  The Government has made no plans to create jobs to ensure that the State's investment in those graduates remains here.  The only thing the Government seems willing to do is to kick them further away.  It is hard enough being a young person starting off in any job, when there are jobs, but worse to be told that the Government will hammer one when one finishes college next June.  The Government's alternative seems to be to release the safety valve and send them off on the bád bán, somewhere else in the world and make them somebody else's problem.  That is bad economics because the Government will have lost the investment of 18 or 22 years of education in those young people.I will not quote the Proclamation but to cherish the young people means ensuring that when they have finished their education, they get a chance.  There is no chance because the Government has not woken up to the fact that post-leaving certificate courses are five times oversubscribed.  People cannot get onto the courses available.  Most of the people on the courses do not come from Ballyfermot.  They come from elsewhere, which is good but it means that there are fewer courses.  The FÁS courses in Ballyfermot are out the door.  Due to the Government cutbacks in FÁS, there are fewer courses available.  There is a logic to that because the construction industry has collapsed so there is no point training hundreds of electricians or bricklayers because there are so many available already.What training is available for those who finish their leaving certificate next year?  Where are the courses?  What is the plan for the economy?  Is it a knowledge economy?  If so, the Government needs to start investing in it but there is no investment.  There is nothing for those who get degrees as computer engineers or scientists because two years into this economic crisis the Government has not had the cop on to roll out a proper investment in the future.  There is no jobs stimulus package.  If we do not start one, other countries will attract the jobs that we have earmarked and we will be left with the dregs and will have to suffer a recession for much longer than we should have to.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I had hoped to speak to the section but everyone is speaking to the amendment.  Young people are looking for jobs.  They need the hope of a job but nothing was presented in the budget to give them that hope.  One in four young people is out of work.  The Minister says that the thinking behind this measure is to give people an incentive to get into a training course but the courses are not being provided.  While €56 million is being made available for short-term FÁS courses, €48 million is being stripped from the supports such as youthreach, vocational education training opportunities and student grants.  The net amount made available for young people is a paltry €8 million.We in Fine Gael want to provide extra opportunities for young people by taking some of the savings that could be made in the overall social welfare budget to try to get young people off the live register and using the funds that would make available to create 13,000 graduate internship places, 10,000 second chance education scheme placements and an extra 5,000 community employment scheme places, along with 10,000 jobs as a result of a workshare scheme.  They are real places for young people on the live register who do not have hope.The Government is putting resources back into FÁS, an agency that has been discredited.  It did not deliver for young people during the good times and will not deliver for them in the current climate.  It is disappointing that the Government has decided to make an across the board cut in payments to young people, telling them to get onto training courses without providing the opportunities for them to avail of those courses.  We need to give our young people hope and the only way we can do that is by giving them training places and job opportunities.  We in Fine Gael have set out detailed proposals for creating job and training opportunities that would give them the hope they need and ensure that next January they do not have to go to Dublin Airport or any other airport to emigrate.  This will be a very dark Christmas for many families with young people at home when on Christmas day parents look around the table and think that this may be their son's or daughter's last Christmas at home as a result of the failed policies of this Government.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I am mystified by the dedication of €56 million to short FÁS courses which the budget documents describe as ten to 20 week courses.  As has been said by many other speakers, the short courses in FÁS, some of which, as Deputy Shortall said, are actually only of two to three weeks' duration, are of seriously limited value except where they are provided as part of an arrangement with an employer.  I say this as one who has worked much in third level education.  It is a form of insanity.I do not know why the Government has not attempted to reform FÁS.  I know it is not the Minister's brief but it is deeply disappointing to see that the only public information about FÁS this week is that the former director general, as part of his very generous package, has got a car worth €60,000.  I do not particularly expect the man to go around on a bike or anything like that but it is unbelievable that FÁS is provided for in this way.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is minus €50 million in the budget figures.  That sum is made up, as has been said, of reductions to CE, to job initiatives and to Skillnets, which most Deputies would agree is actually pretty effective.  They are all going down and, in return, we are getting €56 million in short courses of ten to 20 weeks duration, as described in the budget documents, and €20 million in activation measures.  For the love of God, what about some of the people who are coming out of construction?  They have worked hard, are very intelligent and have done well.  They will be unemployed until they find something else to do in this economy.  Even when construction picks up again, it will never be at the same level.  Many of them need to be able to go back to school and college to qualify for areas like IT or engineering, where eventually there will be jobs.  Instead, what they are being offered is these hopeless short courses of ten to 20 weeks duration, many of them provided by FÁS contractors.  Let us face it, in everything we have heard about FÁS over the past year or so, we learned that many of the FÁS contractors have party political affiliations to Fianna Fáil.  One wonders what is going to happen to the €56 million and €20 million.The €20 million is in regard to activation measures.  I hope the activation measures are open to private employers, NGOs and public sector bodies.  We have put forward a graduate internship programme as a bridge to employment.  Professor Blanchflower, a former member of the UK's Monetary Policy Committee, was in Dublin a month ago.  I met him at length because he is one of the world's experts on unemployment among young people.  There is so much research in this and other countries to show that if somebody becomes unemployed when they are a young adult aged 18 to about 25, the longer the unemployment lasts and the more scarring it is.  If it lasts for more than a year and a half, the effects are still felt by most of those individuals when they are 40, because they have basically missed out on a critical time in their life when they are full of hope, expectation and energy, and want to do something.  It is the time when they want to be their own person and want to be an adult — they want to be men out on a construction site, working with construction workers.  Instead, what they are being offered is a diet of getting up late in the morning, watching videos.  It is a lifestyle everyone here is familiar with and it is not conducive to strong personal development.  Ten to 20 week courses are not the solution to that.If the Government wants to spend that money, it could provide 10,000 places in community colleges and colleges of further education in the VECs, where there is a huge oversubscription by people looking for one to two year courses.  That would then enable those people to go back to college and get a serious qualification for areas of the economy where there are and will be job vacancies, particularly through foreign direct investment.  Just to pump it into FÁS without that organisation being reformed seems to be extraordinarily lax.I wish to refer to fourth level researchers.  We enticed back to Ireland some of the most qualified fourth level graduates who had done their PhDs abroad.  They came back and are working in places like the centres in UCD, DCU, Trinity and DIT.  Some of the teams they are working with have world class reputations.  However, while they were enticed back, it was to contract employment.  Many of them have commitments to mortgages because the understanding was, with the emphasis by the Government on the smart economy, that they could be looking at continued contracts for at least ten years and then have a reasonable chance of getting a tenured job in third level or direct research in industry.  All of that is going by the board.I repeat that it is extraordinary folly for the Government to impose cuts at third level of approximately 4% for all of the universities and the DIT — the Minister should look at the small print figures in the budget.  Again, these are people who came back to Ireland full of hope.  They were a flagship for us and letting them go is like letting go Waterford Glass and other iconic flagships, such as SR Technics, where 1,200 highly skilled people were let go due to complete ineptitude on the part of the Government, and Aer Lingus, given what is currently happening there.  We need a serious revision of policy.What is being proposed in the Bill, instead of creating a framework of hope, will actually blight areas.  The areas that we all know went downhill seriously in the 1980s will now face even more blight.  There are 2,500 local authority houses in the Dublin 15 area.  People have been getting unemployment payments, and young people had been going on to college and staying on longer at school.  With the kind of package announced in the budget, it appears we are going back to the future in terms of reservoirs of estates where the unemployment rate will once again become very high, particularly among young men.  That is a calamity and a profound social mistake on the part of the Government.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	866	When Henry Ford introduced the Model T, somebody asked him what colours would be available.  He replied: "You can have any colour you like as long as it's black."  I am afraid, for the 60,000 young people who will come onto the labour market every year and will not be able to get a job, the option at present seems to be the basic jobseeker's benefit because there will not be enough training places available.  The ways and means by which places are to be made available are not seriously being updated or reformed in line with current needs.I support all the speakers who raised concerns about FÁS being handed the entire responsibility for retraining, and I would like to hear the Minister's response.  To begin with, FÁS has no business being involved in CE schemes.  These schemes would be better in a properly resourced Department of Social and Family Affairs, so that people with a range of skills would avail of a CE scheme in order to learn, train and work.  The very least we need to be able to do for young people is to tell them that at the end of this CE scheme, whatever amount of money the person gets, they will get work of value and the person will be able to look back and say: "I did something useful while I was on that scheme and it has stood me in good stead for whenever an opportunity for a proper career occurs."  It does not seem there is any emphasis on this at present.The amount of extra provision being made is 26,000 places to bring the number up to a total of 180,000, if we are to believe the amount of people who would come in under the net as per this section.  I believe it will probably be a third of that.  That is not adequate training for the entire population of unemployed people.With regard to protecting and stimulating jobs, a national retrofit programme has been announced.  Will there be any co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and others in providing programmes to retrain people to roll that out?  It has major potential.FÁS must be re-evaluated, and perhaps even scrapped and something new put in its place that will be effective and credible.  Members have mentioned some of the industries that have been lost, such as the sugar beet industry.  If even two plants were still in place they could have been used to form a renewable energy core for rural industry.  That would have helped with our carbon footprint and kept people in work, but it was let go on a whim by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan.

Thousands of them entered their studies full of hope.  They now have no prospect of a job and only €100 per week, less than a quarter of what a Fianna Fáil Minister would give as a tip in a restaurant.In my constituency, 3,202 people under 25 are out of work.  In Longford alone there are 1,078, while in Westmeath there are 2,124 people under 25 out of work.  This budget will have a devastating effect on those young people who will be forced to emigrate because of what happened here on Wednesday.  It will have a terrible effect on rural communities and parishes.Earlier, I asked if the Minister had any plans to reinstate and enhance the community employment scheme, providing a greater role for VECs in training.  VECs are doing a good job but there are proposals from Government to amalgamate them.  That would not be necessary if they were given more powers.

Our tourism industry is on its knees and we could improve our signage and the whole tourism infrastructure.  Our heritage and tradition has been allowed to disintegrate in recent years and there is a role for people to play in reactivating that.  It would be of benefit to the entire community and would create a greater sense of pride in who we are as Irish people.Our culture must be examined.  Library services and the arts and crafts industry, sectors where we had a great deal of pride in the past, could be enhanced.  Young people can get involved and it would create a greater sense of being Irish and belonging to the nation where they were born and bred instead of forcing them to emigrate.Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on her plans to instil a greater sense of pride because there is a role there to create jobs for young people instead of putting them on aeroplanes to emigrate.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	870	Has the Government any plans to introduce a supplementary or emergency budget early next year, as happened last year, before this budget has even been passed?  I ask because Deputy Gogarty stated earlier that he believed pensioners could afford to take a cut in their pension.  That is what he should have apologised to the House for saying; it was a disgraceful comment.  He should apologise to pensioners across the State for telling them they could afford to take a cut in his view.  It is easy to say that when he is bringing home a Deputy's salary and the devil knows what else income.  It was downright disgraceful.The cut in jobseeker's allowance being introduced for under 25s is significantly more severe than was even proposed by an bord snip nua.  The McCarthy report did not go that far.A number of Members referred to the lack of a job stimulus packages.  All three Opposition parties put forward packages.  I do not agree with everything in the Fine Gael or Labour Party packages, but there are many viable parts in both of them.  The Government could have looked at the Sinn Féin package, which was 100% viable.It will be difficult to find jobs but unless the Government addresses that critical problem when trying to fix this mess, it will not be repaired.  Why not take €2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and put it into critical infrastructure, particularly a school building programme?  As a former Minister for Education and Science, the Minister is all too familiar with the need to develop that infrastructure and to get children out of those damp, cold, draughty portakabins that many of them must endure currently.  In doing that, the tradesmen, brickies, plasterers and electricians, engineers and architects will get back to work, jobs will be created and that critical social welfare bill will be reduced.Did the Government even consider such a move?  If not, would the Minister mind sharing her views on the idea that was put to her four weeks ago by Sinn Féin?  Did the Government consider any of the Opposition parties' proposals?  Clearly none of them was taken on board.  At least the Minister cannot say she was not told as it is a matter of record that some innovative proposals were put to her.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	871	Interesting points have been made by Deputies during the debate but to listen to some people, one would think there was not a job left in the country.  We are conscious of the numbers on the live register — 413,000 — but 115,000 of those are being supported while in employment.  Sometimes we ignore that fact.  They are on the live register but they are working part-time or are casual workers.  They are not permanently unemployed and it is important that the social welfare system should be able to support people who are in that situation.Every school holiday a few thousand people join the register even though they have regular employment while the schools are in operation.  They end up on the register for a week or a month.  In many ways they are not actively seeking work because they have a job to go back to after the holidays.  I am talking about lollipop ladies and people like that.  There is no problem about paying them but it is not true to say they are out of work.There are 1.9 million people working in this country and we should not forget that.  There are opportunities every day for people to get work.  Our exports went up this year when those in every other country in Europe went down.  We are meeting the needs of a particular market because we have well educated young people and an economic base that will attract industry.A Deputy said the good times did nothing for young people but they did a substantial amount for them.  Even in the current difficulties, in spite of some people finding it more difficult, there are still great opportunities for young people.  I hope they are not depressed listening to some of the comments being made about them here.What is being done in this budget to support them?  A total of €6.5 billion is being spent on an infrastructure capital development which proportionately is the highest in Europe.  This will be expended on school buildings and on infrastructure and it will keep 60,000 to 70,000 people involved in the construction industry which is a very important part of the economy.  This measure is in this budget and it is a jobs stimulus.

In addition, I cite the increased money being given for tourism, the extra millions being given directly to the food industry and the employment stabilisation fund.  Deputy Burton referred to the situation in which employers are unable to give full-time employment to people but they will be allowed to get them training for a couple of days a week and to keep them there.  These are all the hopeful areas where people will be able to get jobs and that includes our young people.  The one thing we all share here is an appreciation of the value and the importance of proper education and training.  It is interesting that whereas my proposals are that young people start on a lower rate but jump up if they participate in education and training, Fine Gael made the same proposal but came at it from the opposite perspective because its proposal was to reduce the young people's allowance who did not participate.  However, our policy ideas are similar.  The legal aspects of the policy have been checked out because we did that with regard to the 18 and 19 year olds earlier this year.  It is an incentive for people to be able to train——

I recognise that there is a difference in the older age group who may be graduates and who may be very well qualified.  For that reason, my next amendment includes work placement in the scheme.  They may not need further education and training but they need work experience.  For that reason they will get the full rate of pay if they participate in the graduate or work placement schemes.  This is a recognition of their skills.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The whole work placement scheme has been completely revised because when it was launched with very good intent, employers came back to us with the case that if they were an employer of fewer than ten people, they would be unable to take someone on but now it has been changed and they will be able to do so.  We have shortened the length of time which a person has to be on the live register and we have lengthened the time in which a person can participate in the scheme.  The new criteria will facilitate many more employers to take on people and many more young people to participate in the scheme.  A young person of 22 to 24 years will receive €150 a week while on the live register but if they participate in either the education training or that work placement scheme, then they will get the full rate.Deputy Kenny raised an important point about young people who may have basic literacy skills and who are not able to participate in the same level of training as others.  We are very conscious of this point.  I saw a very practical example in Limerick and I have asked that it be extended elsewhere.  The local employment service, FÁS, and the local departmental office co-operated to profile and streamline the people who needed education and training.  Instead of sending to the local employment service the 40-year old man who was well educated along with the 18-year old who had basic literacy skills, the local employment service took 18 to 19 year olds, the young people, and targeted a course for them.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan may be familiar with this arrangement.  This is the type of co-operation which is now spreading throughout the country, although I accept it should have been established before this, to target people in the right direction.Extra courses have been made available for the coming year in education and training.  One of the good things about an 18 year old receiving only €100 is that it is a real disincentive for a young person to go automatically onto the live register.  Contrary to what Deputy Lee thought last night, a person with a work record and who qualifies for jobseeker's benefit gets the full rate.  We are talking here about young people who have never worked, who have no connection with the workforce.  It is wrong to say a person who may have been working from the time he or she was 17 will only receive €150 at age 24; such a person will receive the full rate.  That is also the situation if the person has a dependent child.  It is a real disincentive for an 18 year old to go onto the live register if he or she is only going to be given €100.  It is a real incentive for them to continue and take up one of the 30,000 places that are on the post-leaving certificate courses.  It is a real incentive for them to take up one of the 45,000 first-year places in higher education.  It is a real incentive for them to participate in youthreach and all the other schemes.  For that reason alone, we could all point to families where fathers have taken the 18 year old young fellow and trotted him down to the social welfare office and advised him to follow on in a great family tradition.  That is the type of cycle we are trying to break here.Deputy Burton in particular asked about the national training fund, the new €20 million which is being provided.  She asked a specific question and I think she will be pleased with the answer.  We are looking for innovative proposals from the private sector and from the public sector to make extra provision for the unemployed.  This is expected to provide about 3,500 additional training places.  It is being targeted at the low skilled, at the under-35s and at those who were formerly employed in the construction, retail, and manufacturing sectors——

It is a little unfair of Deputies in talking about FÁS to criticise much of the local provision.  There is no question about the need for the new legislation which the Tánaiste is introducing on reform of FÁS at the top level and its governance.  However, local FÁS training offices around the country have started to adapt to new needs.  They are bringing in people who formerly worked in the construction industry and retraining them in the retrofitting and green energy technology.  This is taking place in Loughlinstown where people are being up-skilled and also in other FÁS centres around the country.  It does a terrible disservice and disrespect to the local FÁS training centres to say that they are not adapting in that way because it is happening.  The VECs are responding in a really positive way to the needs and there can always be a greater role for them.

The local authorities are one group of people who have offered to take people but in these circumstances one always needs the full co-operation of the trade unions.  We must ensure that taking in young people does not involve job displacement because jobs must be protected.  There is plenty of scope and I believe the unions have a major role to play in ensuring that young people can get the opportunities.Deputy Burton spoke about the smart economy.  Additional money has been invested in research this year.  Research and innovation are major priorities.  A single line of funding has been created to ensure that there is co-operation and collaboration between the academic institutions and industry.  It was never the intention that people in research would end up taking tenured posts in third level.  The aim is to get them into industry, develop patents and to register them and then to start generating income, further employment and offshoot companies.  Another provision in the budget is to ensure that start-up companies continue to get additional capital allowances and tax allowances and to have those extended.  There are significant provisions in this budget to support the creation of employment, additional training and additional education.  This section of this Bill contains an incentive to young people to take those opportunities——
