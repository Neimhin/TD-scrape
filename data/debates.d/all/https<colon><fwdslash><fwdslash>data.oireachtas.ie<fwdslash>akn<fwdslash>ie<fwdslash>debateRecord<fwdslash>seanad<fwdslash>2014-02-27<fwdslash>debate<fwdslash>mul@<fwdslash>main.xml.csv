The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, will be in the House to discuss job creation and economic growth; the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will be here to discuss An Action Plan for Jobs, while the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, will discuss apprenticeships and training with us.

Many of us have called for a debate on jobs and I appreciate the Leader's arranging these important debates with the Ministers and Minister of State. I commend Senator Feargal Quinn for the passing of his Upward Only Rent (Clauses and Reviews) Bill 2013 yesterday. I know that many Senators on the other side of the House support the Bill but they did not see fit to vote for it. It is important that the Bill was passed. I hope that Fine Gael, in particular, will see through the commitment in its party manifesto prior to the 2011 general election which said the party would pass legislation to give all tenants the right to have their commercial rents reviewed in 2011, irrespective of upward-only or other review clauses. I know that manifesto promises do not really mean anything but this is an opportunity for Fine Gael to make good on its promise on this issue. Senator Feargak Quinn did a magnificent job yesterday and my party was only too happy to support him. The Bill has now passed in the Seanad, with the tacit assistance of the provisional Labour Party grouping of the three missing-in-action Senators. I note that they are not here this morning either, but I would say to those Senators that they would be better off voting for proposals that they support rather than just going missing. Their actions are pathetic. If they are going to ride two horses on every issue and stand for nothing, that is pathetic. They have done it before on many occasions-----

I want to know what the position is on Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill. Will the Government accept it in the Dáil? I also commend my colleague, Senator Mary White, and thank the Government for agreeing to pass the Parental Leave Bill 2013 on Committee Stage. It is very good legislation and all of us agree with it. That Bill gives lie to what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said in the run-up to the campaign to abolish the Seanad - namely, that the Seanad was a dog that never barked. That assertion is completely untrue, as demonstrated yesterday by Bills from Senators Feargal Quinn and Mary White. This House has a very important function which it carries out very well.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the proposed new GP contracts. I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to whom the buck seems to have been passed on this issue, come to the House to discuss the matter. I ask that we be given an opportunity to put some of the concerns of the GPs directly to the Minister or Minister of State. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate specifically on the contract for the under-sixes. Most of us would prefer to see children who need GP cards getting them. I am all for the idea of under-sixes having free GP care, but I am not in favour of children who are seven, eight or nine years old losing medical cards or GP cards. What is the point in trying to roll out an unworkable contract to give free GP care to healthy children under six years, many of whom are in families who can afford to pay for such care, while taking medical cards and GP cards from children and the elderly who need them? I met a woman last week with terminal lung cancer who really needs her card. Cystic fibrosis patients are having their cards taken from them and the Government knows this. I ask that the Minister of State come to the House to address these issues and urge the Leader to make the necessary arrangements.

It is welcome that the focus will be on jobs, because a number of Members have called for a debate on this issue, and it is good to hear that the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be here to discuss different aspects of the jobs strategy. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the forthcoming report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on domestic violence. There are suggestions before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges that the Seanad formally debate reports from Oireachtas committees, and it would be good to see that set up formally. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is in the process of conducting hearings on domestic and gender-based violence. We had an excellent series of presentations yesterday and last week we had another excellent set of presentations which have been discussed on the floor of this House. Senator Tony Mulcahy made a particularly powerful contribution in that regard. It would be good for this House to debate the report that the Oireachtas committee produces, which will recommend specific changes in legislation that may assist in more effective tackling or combating of domestic and gender-based violence.

This follows a report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality published last year in which the committee recommended that a similar approach be adopted in Ireland. I have asked the Leader for a debate on that report. We are engaged in correspondence with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue.

I also thank colleagues for supporting Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill yesterday. The advice communicated from the Attorney General is strange. It suggests one form of property right - namely, rent - enjoys constitutional protection, while all other forms of income do not. All other forms of income have declined in this recession. Indeed, the Constitutional Convention debated a wider definition of property rights only last weekend. Social welfare payments, wages and other forms of income are not protected by the Constitution. We need to have a wider definition of property rights rather than the one that was used to back up the Government's stance yesterday. I also call for a debate on Northern Ireland. This is a critical time and the Northern Ireland Assembly may collapse. It is ominous that in February 1914, Edward Carson, speaking in the House of Commons, stated:I say this to my Nationalist fellow-countrymen [...], you have never tried to win over Ulster. You have never tried to understand her position.At that stage, we were on the brink of Home Rule for the whole of Ireland. Let us not make the same mistake again. We must have a debate on Northern Ireland. I further suggest we ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, if she would be willing to address the House.

Perhaps we might consider setting the record straight. Mr. Sigerson was a distinguished scientist and a promoter of the Celtic revival. Mr. John Grainger of UCC has communicated his thanks to the Seanad for commemorating the fact that UCC is the current holder of the Sigerson Cup. Mr. Sigerson appears to have been overlooked, but he played an important role in the very first Seanad in December 1922. I ask that he be commemorated in some way, as he appears to have been neglected in the intervening period.

I do not wish to revisit anything that happened yesterday, but we all know the only flaw in Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill related to the wise counsel of the Attorney General, which the Government wisely took on board. That said, and let us not argue, there is nothing preventing landlords and tenants taking into account market conditions. As a practising valuer, I have seen it happen and have engaged in it and I have seen rents held and rents move downwards. In the conditions we have faced in the past few years, commercial landlords were quite wise to try to hold on to tenants, as they did successfully in many cases, so let us be honest. As this is a matter of the legal interpretation of a constitutional issue, let us park it. The other House can deal with it now. That is all I have to say on the matter.

For some time, this side of the House has called for a Minister for rural affairs and that legislation should be rural-proofed. I tabled a matter on the Adjournment about the closure of a number of banks in west Cork, in particular in Schull and Ballydehob, and the Minister of State the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, felt that, in some instances, the banks were using economic restructuring as a scapegoat and that was not justified. As the banks in Schull and Ballydehob were closed, he indicated that the three post offices on that peninsula would be supported by extra financial business which the banks had failed to provide to the local community. As has happened all over the country, another bank was closed in Dromcollogher. One arm of government is saying social welfare must be paid through the banks rather than the post offices, but Government policy should be tweaked in such a way that rural post offices are supported.  Last night I met a postmistress from Ardgroom village, which is 110 miles from Cork city. She said farmers who were in receipt of farm assist payments had to travel 50 miles to the bank in Bantry to draw the money as it must be lodged in a bank, rather than a post office. This is a serious kick in the teeth for rural Ireland. As it is such a serious issue and as this is the first time I have spoken on it for some weeks, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, or whoever is the appropriate Minister comes to the House today, even for one hour, to explain the direction in which we are going in regard to rural Ireland.  The banks have closed and the Garda stations are closing. If the rural post offices go, it will be an awful kick in the teeth. The policies of the Government are dictating that they will be closed. The banks bullied us and let us down with a bang and now the post offices, which are the only back-up people in rural Ireland have, are being ground to a halt because the policy of certain Ministers is that people should forget about rural post offices and use the banks. As we should forget the banks and support post offices, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business.

It is only right that in 2014, the Government place a major emphasis on job creation, the promotion of entrepreneurship and additional manufacturing. I wish raise an issue a constituent raised with me this week and ask the Leader to arrange a discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the operation of the jury system and how it impacts on people. I was contacted by a constituent who lives in Ballinasloe but who was called to the courthouse in Galway three times this week to be considered for jury duty. That involved a round trip of 80 miles three times this week. This person works part-time and her husband is on a two-day week. There is absolutely no consideration of out-of-pocket expenses in respect of travelling for jury service, or to be considered for jury service. That is wrong in this day and age, in particular when people face serious financial difficulties, and it needs to be reviewed. Will the Leader take this up with the Minister? The person in question was most anxious to do her civic duty and would certainly look forward to participating on a jury but she felt aggrieved that she would be significantly out of pocket and was not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of her participation in, or consideration for selection for, jury duty.

I circulated a motion to my colleagues yesterday evening condemning the holding of child beauty pageants. I really hope we get cross-party support for this motion and I worded it in a way which I hope enables this. We need to unite in our opposition to these types of pageant held purely for financial gain. The message it sends to young people is reprehensible and we need to ensure we unite and say they have no place in Ireland. I thank Members who have already signed the motion and ask that all Members put their names to it. I refer to Senators John Crown and Mark Daly's Bill on smoking in cars with children. Senator John Crown has been in touch with departmental officials and has been advised that the Government should have amendments by the first week of April. I have been in contact with the Minister's adviser and got a similar message. Will the Leader set a date for the first week of April, remembering that May will the second anniversary of commencement of this Bill in the House? The Government has had 20 months to draft amendments to quite a clear Bill, which everybody says they support. However, we do not seem to be able to get the amendments. I hope that in the first week of April, the Leader will allocate time for this Bill but I put him on notice that I expect the Government amendments to be tabled here. We will not accept it going to the Dáil with the Bill and tabling the amendments there. This House should ensure the Bill is completed here in order that it can sail through the Dáil and perhaps be agreed by it before Easter. I ask for a date for the taking of that Bill.

If anything vindicated its right to exist and its importance to democracy and political life in the country, yesterday was it. It was a superb triumph for our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, on which I compliment him. He has been extraordinarily industrious. If one looks at the number of Bills he has produced, I simply do not know how he does it. He must have a back-up team somewhere. This really does justice to the House and justifies its existence. I disagree with my friend, the leader of the Fianna Fáil group, Senator Darragh O'Brien, and commend the Labour Party Members. It took guts to stay away. I do not think anybody in Fianna Fáil would have done any more than that or would have broken the Whip. This is the realism of politics and it allowed that Bill to go through. Being a politician, I would like to lay a bit of a claim to the triumph because I both took and gave advice. I asked Senator Feargal Quinn if he wanted support for the Bill. He said: "Yes, but would you ever keep your mouth shut because we are afraid the Government will talk it out"; therefore, I went to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and came back for the vote.I suggested to Senator Feargal Quinn that we call a walk-through vote. That is part of the way we run it, but it is the Senator's triumph, for which we should all unanimously commend him. This also questions the Cathaoirleach's position under Standing Orders. I do not mean this in a personal way or as a criticism of the way he chairs proceedings. The Cathaoirleach is elected as an independent representative to be neutral and I am not sure if this nonsense that he or she must always go with the Government is in Standing Orders, but it is not in the Constitution. I acknowledge that it follows precedent and the Cathaoirleach was perfectly correct in what he did, but that is one of the reforms that needs to be introduced. Perhaps if we provide for a secret ballot for the Chair whereby he or she is instructed to vote on the issue and not to automatically to go with the Government, that would be an enhancement of our democracy. I refer to the question of the Garda Commissioner. I do not call for heads but I am sorry to say he has to go. There is no doubt in my mind about this. The latest revelations involve claims of sexual harassment and this woman-----

Barrett, maidir le díospóireacht ar chúrsaí an Tuaiscirt. We have called for a debate on Northern Ireland issues on many occasions. It would be timely as there are many issues of concern to us. It is obvious from some of the comments made yesterday on HGV regulation that there is a great deal of confusion, or else Members are getting misinformation from their SDLP or Unionist colleagues in the North regarding the HGV levy. It is a tax over which the Assembly has no control. I assure anybody who is concerned that Sinn Féin has lobbied long and hard to ensure the levy is not introduced. Our leadership is very much engaged on that issue. However, there is a role for both governments to play in these issues to ensure tax affairs are fully devolved to the Assembly in order that it would have full control over them. It is welcome that we will have debates on employment. It is ironic that an announcement on jobs is being made today when we are being given information by newly qualified social workers that they will be employed on a graduate scheme, similar to what happened with newly qualified teachers and nurses. During the debates, it will be important to discuss the rates of pay that people are being asked to work for and the fact that newly qualified social workers are being recruited on less favourable conditions that their predecessors, which is a huge issue. I raised a serious question that needs to be answered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the Adjournment last night regarding the development of a fish farm on Inis Oirr and the meeting that he and the Taoiseach had with the chief executive officer of Marine Harvest, a company that could potentially win the licence for the project. The reply given by the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tom Hayes, was correct in that he said the licensing process must be independent, but the fact that the Minister and the Taoiseach have met one of the major stakeholders in the industry at a time when the licensing process is under way was inappropriate. I ask the Leader to use his office to ask the Minister to make a clear statement that the issue of the Inis Oirr fish farm was not discussed with the chief executive officer of Marine Harvest when they met recently and that he does not intend to discuss it when he attends the aquaculture conference in Norway in the next few weeks.

I attended yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform expecting to be reassured by the special liquidator and Department of Finance officials that those with INBS loans would be protected when the loan book is sold. All the bidders will not be subject to regulation by the Central Bank. I was shocked to discover that the commitment given that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears would be adhered to by prospective bidders would not form a legal condition of the contract for sale, which means it will not be binding. That is an unacceptable flaw. The second flaw is that even if that condition had been incorporated into the contract, there is nothing to protect mortgage holders from a further sale of the loan book, either in its entirely or as individual loans.

Third, interest rates will be imposed by the lender. That is grand when we are dealing with Bank of Ireland, AIB and so on, but these mortgage holders will be dealing with organisations that are based outside the country and there will be no restriction on the interest rate they charge unless it is described as usury, and we all know what that means - more than 50% and up to 200% in some instances. This is a serious issue. The alternative is that the loan book should move to NAMA, and that is what should happen. There is no protection for INBS mortgage holders in what is proposed. Only 1% of them are on tracker mortgages, which means 99% of them have no protection.

I commend tourism interests for the latest tourism figures, which highlight an 8% increase in tourist numbers between November 2013 and January 2014. That is an astonishing achievement and I congratulate Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and everybody in the hospitality sector for upping their game. Will the Leader consider inviting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to support the view that, as we are, I hope, on an upward curve in the context of visitor numbers, the hospitality sector and those who provide services for tourists should not engage in a rip-off republic syndrome? The reason I raise this issue is that I had occasion yesterday afternoon to visit the self-service restaurant of the National Library of Ireland, one of our cultural institutions.I preface my remarks by saying I understand cultural institutions in the country are struggling financially, mainly as a result of cutbacks since the recession started in 2008. They must make themselves financially viable. However, I had occasion to look at the prices being charged for small slices of cake. This applies to several varieties of cake on sale in the self-service area, at the exploitative price of €3.25 each.

This is because cultural institutions are a main source of tourism revenue. An extraordinary number of visitors, Irish and non-Irish, visit our cultural institutions and I strongly encourage them to continue to do so. I do not want to single out the National Library of Ireland. How many hospitality outlets are charging exorbitant prices that will not help the tourism industry? That is why I ask whether it is an opportunity for the Minister to encourage the Irish hospitality sector to ensure it does not exploit tourists coming into the country.

Sinn Féin colleagues were eager to remind the correspondent from The Irish Times of my absence from the Chamber. I was addressing a school in Bettystown and happy to be obliged by one of my Government colleagues with a pair, which is more than my Sinn Féin colleagues managed to do when I tabled a motion on the need to put high voltage lines underground. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take No. 8 before No. 1, Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) (Amendment) Bill 2014 - First Stage. The Bill provides for a requirement that high voltage electricity transmission cables be placed underground where physically possible and would make certain other changes. I ask if the Leader can make time for a debate in early course. We have not had enough debate in the Chamber on issues relating to pylons, on our energy strategy and on the concerns of tens of thousands of people about massive turbines being erected in many parts of the country with a view to supplying cheap energy to Britain but without the public interest first and foremost. I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik on the European Parliament recommendation on the need to criminalise purchasers of sexual services in the Honeyball report. When I first heard about the report I thought it referred to a character in a James Bond movie, but it appears to be a substantial proposal. I compliment Senators Ivana Bacik and Katherine Zappone on their work on the issue at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. I took the lead in the previous Seanad by introducing amendments and Private Members' motions calling for legislation to bring us in line with the Nordic policy of criminalising the user. It is an important development and we should debate it in early course.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	77	The point I want to raise was well articulated by Senator Aideen Hayden. Yesterday, I listened to the debate on the IBRC loan book at the committee. It is appalling that we are approving a situation where foreign private equity funds can target the purchase of the loans with no safeguards and we are depending on their goodwill in treating borrowers sympathetically. It is unacceptable for any Government to be in that position. The loan book will go to the funds who target returns on investment of 20% to 30%. Usually, this is in a high risk area. I disagree fundamentally with the Minister for Finance who claims it is not practical to make these loans saleable to the borrowers at the discounted rate. That is exactly what we should do. For people trying to hold onto their own houses, it is a given that it should happen. I am concerned about foreign funds buying property at the bottom of the market. If the economy recovers in the coming decade, all of the money will be sent abroad and we will not have the indigenous investors and the capital required to reconstruct our economy. There is no thought, and deficiencies in the Department of Finance and at political level must be addressed. I said at the time that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, politicised the Garda Commissioner by using politically sensitive information against Mick Wallace, who is a constituency colleague-----

The Minister and the Commissioner must now go. I appeal to the members of the Labour Party who would have been shouting from the rafters for far less fundamental breaches when in opposition. They should not bend the knee because it involves a Minister who goes with their social agenda.

The Bill has passed a number of stages and we should be given a definite date for the debate on Report Stage. I received correspondence from one of the officials involved telling us that the various Departments' Report Stage amendments would be ready by the first week in April. The official asked us not to press for any debate earlier than this. I acknowledge the co-operation of the Leader in the past few weeks, when he indicated he would make time available. In January 2013 we were given a similar assurance that the amendments would be ready by the end of January 2013, 13 months ago. I respectfully ask the Leader to designate a specific day for the debate. It should be 2 April, which provides an opportunity for the promised amendments to be delivered. I would be grateful if the Leader could designate a time on that day for the debate on Report Stage.

Barrett in a request for a debate on Northern Ireland as a matter of urgency. I request the Leader to invite the Taoiseach to address the House on a serious issue. I support my colleague, Senator Denis O'Donovan, in his request that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, attend the House to discuss the future of rural post offices. The issue has been raised in the past fefw weeks. While I appreciate the replies to the Leader and the Deputy Leader, it is a serious situation and the Minister must come and outline Government plans to sustain post offices, particularly in rural Ireland. There should be positive discrimination towards rural Ireland in respect of post offices and other services, including representation at local and national political levels. The Labour Party policy on local government involves taking away representation from rural Ireland and moving it to the heavily populated areas of the east coast. Will the Labour Party pursue this policy in respect of post offices?

I ask the Leader to consider having a debate involving the relevant Minister on the licensing of livestock ships. A livestock ship licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine last year was recently impounded in Cornwall. Although the licence was issued by the Department, on a return trip to Germany the ship was impounded because the British found it lacking in normal standards of safety. The British agency examined the fire detection and crew emergency systems and crew accommodation and it noted an absence of hot water. Compassion in World Farming has argued that the system of licensing ships carrying livestock is lacking. I did not know anything about this until recently but it appears to be an issue deserving attention. Perhaps we might have a debate on it in the House.

It has been passed by Seanad Éireann and the other House will decide where and when it will proceed.  The Government accepted the Parental Leave Bill 2013, about which, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, outlined, it has many reservations. Nevertheless, it was prepared to accept it on Committee Stage and will have many amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  I will certainly ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, to come before us to address the matter of GP contracts and the treatment of children under the age of six years. I hope he will be able to come to the Seanad in the next few weeks. Senator Ivana Bacik called for debates on a number of reports, including one from the European Parliament and another from the justice committee on prostitution. I do not know if the report on domestic violence has been published-----

I also note the Senator's points on the situation in Ukraine and the request for a debate on the matter. Senators Sean D. Barrett and Diarmuid Wilson called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I will request the Taoiseach to come here for it.  Senator Paul Coghlan commented on Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill, while Senators Denis O'Donovan and Diarmuid Wilson spoke about post offices and rural Ireland. As I stated yesterday and the day before, the Minister in question attended the Seanad to take an Adjournment matter and presented a very comprehensive report on the issue. It is not the intention of the Government to close post offices. When I first mentioned that the Government did not intend to close post offices, I was heckled from the other side. Seventeen post offices were closed in the past three years, but 197 were closed in the previous three years under the previous Administration. The figures speak for themselves in that regard. Senator Michael Mullins spoke about expenses for persons on jury duty. We will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Perhaps the Senator might consider raising it on the Adjournment.  I am sure we will have a very good discussion next week on the Private Members' motion to be brought forward by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  Senators Jillian van Turnhout and John Crown commented on the Bill dealing with smoking in cars where children were present. There are a number of items of correspondence on the matter from the relevant Department to both Senators. It has been indicated that the Bill will be taken in early April. I intend to include it in the agenda for 2 April. It is appalling that there has been such a delay in taking the Bill, but I am unsure who or what held it up. However, I assure the Senators that it will be on the agenda on 2 April.

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, gave a clear and comprehensive response when the matter was raised on the Adjournment last evening.  Senators Aideen Hayden and Jim Walsh spoke about the Irish Nationwide Building Society and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation mortgage books. The Minister for Finance will be in the House next week when I am sure the opportunity will be taken to mention these matters.  Senator Paschal Mooney also spoke about and welcomed the significant increase in tourist numbers. It should be welcomed by all of us. I note the Senator's points on the need for the industry to monitor prices in order that we do not see significant increases. However, I would have thought a price of €3.25 for a piece of cake was fairly reasonable in this day and age. Senator Rónán Mullen proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.

Cuireann Sinn Féin fáilte go ginearálta roimh an mBille agus síleann muid gur céim mhaith chun cinn í go bhfuil muid ag úsáid an ghréasáin leictreachais le cúrsaí leathanbhanda a thabhairt chun cinn. Cloisim ó mo chomhghleacaí, Deputy Michael Colreavy, a bhfuil ról aige mar urlabhraí cumarsáide, gurb é ceann de na príomh smaointe a bhí aige ná go ndéanfaí rud cosúil le seo agus go bhfuil sé an-bhuíoch gur thóg an tAire ar bord na moltaí a rinne sé i leith seo. The Bill is very positive. It should ensure considerable improvements in the access of many people to broadband and should enhance the quality of life because of the issues that have arisen with the last mile of broadband from some of the companies that have been rolling out services to date. However, we still have reservations which is the reason we put forward this simple amendment which calls for the fibre optic cable not to be privatised. I appreciate that the Minister has said it is not the intention of the Government to privatise the system, but in order to copperfasten the position we should include the provision in the legislation to ensure that no Government can in future make such a change without going back to the Houses of the Oireachtas. One of the main reasons we have such a poor broadband infrastructure compared to our European neighbours is due to the fact that Telecom Éireann was privatised in the 1990s. Ireland is a small country and a national State provider such as Telecom Éireann was needed to provide the necessary infrastructure to extend the broadband network. That is partly the reason this solution has been sought. I am pleased the ESB is now coming on board to assist in the roll-out of broadband services as it has a relationship with every home in the country. I take the Minister at his word that it is not his intention personally at this stage that the system would be privatised but the position should be copperfastened in the legislation because we have seen what can happen when Ministers or an Administration change. I hope he will take the amendment on board which has been put forward in good faith.

It would be so wrong to tie the hands of a future Government if the correct thing to do is to privatise the fibre optic cable. We could say so many other things as well but it is not the policy of the Government to privatise, which I understand, but at some future stage there could well be a need to privatise the network and it would be incorrect at this stage for us to tie the hands of a future Government so as to restrict it from taking such a step.

As regards the amendment before the House, the purpose of the Bill is to provide an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage, now or in the future, in the installation and operation of an electronic communications network attached to the existing electricity network and to provide for consequential matters. The current legislative proposal does not exempt the ESB from any current legislative requirements or regulatory rules. The ESB is required by the Electricity (Supply)(Amendment) Act of 1988 to secure the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to dispose of shares or interests in the assets of any such company. This requirement will apply to any electronic communications assets the ESB may develop directly or through any subsidiary. If the ESB enters the fully liberalised electronic communications market in the future, in the manner it has proposed in outline form, or in any other form, it must do so on a commercial basis. It is essential therefore that it has the vires to negotiate on commercial terms with potential partners to co-fund the capital required to develop electronic communications networks. The authority to negotiate such funding would be significantly compromised if ownership of the asset is restricted to the State by primary legislation. For those reasons, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment advanced by the Senators.

I am quite concerned by it, but I am also concerned by the comments of Senator Feargal Quinn, for whom I have great respect. I fear there is an agenda to potentially privatise the fibre optic network in the future, something to which we would be totally opposed. I would have thought a Labour Party Minister in particular would have the same view. I thought the measure could be included in the legislation. There is no reason a future Administration could not bring the legislation back to the Houses if it felt there was no option but to privatise the network or to sell parts of it off. That is the proper mechanism to allow for something of that nature as it would allow for a full debate in the Houses. What we are doing is signing off on a situation where a Minister could potentially privatise the network. I do not say that is the intention of the Minister, but we are leaving the door open to a future Minister or Administration. It is the wrong move. I hope the Minister will reconsider.

The idea is to use the existing infrastructure of the ESB to roll out future-proofed fibre optic cable to parts of Ireland that would not have a realistic prospect of that happening. It is a very innovative use of infrastructure in the ownership of a commercial State company. It proposes to do it by way of a joint venture with a leading telecommunications company. If I took on board Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh’s amendment it would tie the hands of the ESB in terms of the commercial negotiations with a telecommunications company on the funding of the roll-out. I have not yet seen the detail although I have been concerned with and supportive of the proposal for quite a long time. It is one of the most exciting projects that has come on the scene in terms of providing connectivity to parts of Ireland that otherwise could not remotely expect to have fibre optic cable. I presume the partner will come up with a great deal of the funding in order to allow that to happen. Apart from anything else I would be constraining that possibility if I were to accept the amendment. If we have survived the hurricane of the past five years without privatising the ESB, the Senator can be reasonably relaxed that we are likely to be able to defend the citadel into the foreseeable future. It is very difficult sometimes to get any credit for things that one does in this business but it is exceptionally difficult to get any credit for things that one stopped happening. I am personally very pleased - like Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh I have great respect for Senator Feargal Quinn – and proud that the ESB is still in State ownership. Senator Feargal Quinn did not say any different from this. What he said is that we ought not in primary legislation tie the hands of a future Administration in terms of the joint vehicle we are rolling out. There are very good reasons the flexibility to allow the ESB to do business as it thinks proper, in order to provide this service and to secure as much funding as possible with whomever it is it will partner, is a very good outcome in the public interest. The Internet has transformed the way we live and educate ourselves, but it is also a curse because one cannot go to a public meeting these days without encountering some hob lawyer who has been on the Internet or some phony scientist who has accessed some crank in California who suggests the sky will fall on Grafton Street if one does X, Y and Z.It is almost impossible to compete with it. I forget where I was going with that point.

I reiterate that we are in favour of the general thrust of the Bill. Who will own the network if there is a PPP scenario where investment is coming from outside into this development? That is the real issue. The Minister indicated that ownership of the network might be shared between State and private enterprise in the new venture. We are calling for the State network to remain within the ownership of the ESB. The Minister talks about weathering the storm for five years. People are concerned that the Uisce Éireann scenario means the water network could be privatised in future. We have seen parts of Bord Gáis for sale on the public market. People know about the Telecom Éireann debacle, which happened under a previous Administration and led us to the current debacle in respect of broadband. That is why there are genuine fears. If the Minister is saying I should not be concerned because the ESB will remain in State ownership, but that there is private investment in the project, is it possible that the network is not fully in State ownership and we will not own it fully any more? If so, I would be concerned.

The ESB is free to make what arrangements it thinks appropriate. That will come to me in due course in respect of the shareholder agreement but in terms of the vesting of ownership of the supply system, it remains in the control of the ESB.

Táim thar a bheith buíoch dó as teacht isteach ar an ábhar seo. The ferry service to the Aran Islands and Inis Mór in particular is in effect the highway for people living on the island because it provides their access to and from the island. Until recent years there was a subsidy available to the operators of the service to serve all three islands. The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Dinny McGinley, decided to unbundle that contract in order that the service to Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr continued with a subsidy but there is no subsidy available for the service to Inis Mór. The logic was, I suppose, that because many tourists go to Inis Mór, it is a busy service and would be self-sustaining. It appears that is not the case. Members of Comharchumann Forbartha Árann have raised this with me. They are very concerned. They met representatives of the Oireachtas in January and asked us to raise this issue. The local Deputies on the Government side assured us at that meeting that they would seek a meeting with the Minister of State on this issue because it is very serious. That has not happened. What engagement has there been between the Minister of State and the people of Inis Mór on this issue? The major issue raised by Comharchumann Forbartha Árann is that an unsubsidised ferry service cannot be guaranteed during the winter months, and it asks that this route be advertised for tender as soon as possible. The company running the service commercially says it is losing money during the winter months. There is no obligation on it to provide a service during the winter months and, therefore, the people of Inis Mór could be left without any service whatsoever. The comharcumann also has a problem with levies imposed by Galway County Council and has asked the Minister of State to intervene. As islanders, they believe this is an unfair tax and they vehemently oppose it. They have asked the Minister of State to intervene with the local authority to try to come up with another solution instead of a levy, which they maintain has an adverse effect on the numbers travelling to the island. The numbers have dropped dramatically and they have written to inform the Minister of State about this. They believe Galway County Council as a public body should work in the interests of the island and not impose a tax on travel to the island. The Government abolished tax on flights in and out of the whole island because it was detrimental to tourism but allowing a county council impose a tax on people travelling to a smaller offshore island raises the same argument, as the figures show. The co-op also notes that no other coastal island has such a levy, and the loss of between 40,000 and 50,000 people per annum travelling from Doolin to Inis Mór is due to this levy. This is generating a great deal of negative publicity and ticket prices will probably increase due to this levy, resulting in fewer people travelling. This is a serious problem for the people of the Aran Islands. They have forwarded the statistics to the Minister of State on the fall in visitor numbers. They feel the locals are being penalised because the cost of travelling from Inis Mór to Rossaveal has increased as a result of the subsidy's being discontinued. It is unacceptable that since the meeting in January the Minister of State has not met the Comharchumann Forbartha Arann on this issue. I will call on him to have that meeting as soon as possible to see what can be done to rectify the situation. The tenders for the ferry service at least could be advertised to see what type of operators would pitch for them, how much it would cost and whether a subsidy could or needs to be reinstated for the ferry service.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15058	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	145	Tá mé ag labhairt inniú ar son an Aire Stáit Mhic Fhionnlaoich a bhfuil aiféala air nach féidir leis a bheith i lathair de bharr go bhfuil sé ar ghnó eile. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is the principal Department charged with island development by supporting the improvement of infrastructure and assisting with the provision of essential services. The Department subsidises lifeline transport services for inhabited offshore islands. These comprise passenger and cargo ferry services, with a connecting bus service where necessary. In addition, the Department subsidises an air service for the three Aran Islands, which includes Inis Mór, under a public service obligation contract. In this regard the Department also subsidises a management service for the aerodromes based on these islands. In all, the Department subsidises transport services for 19 offshore islands in counties Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork. These services provide safe, all-year round transport services for the islands involved, thereby improving the quality of life for islanders and supporting sustainable island communities as well as promoting island tourism. Expenditure on these services was €5.9 million in 2013. The same allocation is available in 2014. The contract for the subsidised passenger ferry service for Inis Mór came to an end on 31 January 2013. The Department sought tenders through a public tendering process, as it does with all its subsidised services, for a further five year contract until 31 January 2018, but received no tender within the deadline set. In the absence of a tender, officials from the Department held discussions with the ferry operator that had been providing the contracted service to explore the possibility of entering into a new contract for the service on the same terms as the previous contract. Unfortunately, these discussions were unsuccessful as the Department could not accept the operator's claim for a substantial subsidy increase on a service that is, by all accounts, profitable without a subsidy. The Department understands that the operator continued to provide the service at the same level since the end of the contract with the State but that the fares payable by island residents were increased. I understand tsome uncertainty has recently arisen regarding the continuation of the service at the current level. A representative of the operator met my Department and indicated that circumstances for the company have altered and that it cannot guarantee it will be able to continue operating as previously. Officials also met representatives of the island co-op and the Minister of State is aware of their concerns about the current situation. The Minister of State would like to make it clear to the Senator that he is open to undertaking any reasonable steps that would assist in finding a resolution to meet with the requirements of all parties. Any steps the Department might take must fall within public procurement regulations and be achievable within the resources available to it. There are no plans at present to readvertise this contract as the Department does not have in its possession any evidence to indicate that the outcome of another public tendering process would differ dramatically from that which took place towards the end of 2012. As the Senator will appreciate, it is incumbent on the Minister of State to ensure public money is spent in the most cost-effective manner and achieves the maximum return for the State. The Department cannot justify subsidising a service if such subsidy is not warranted.I assure the Senator that efforts will continue to ensure there will be a regular passenger ferry service to the island at reasonable cost throughout the year and Department personnel are always available for discussion.

The key line in the reply is that the Department does not have in its possession any evidence which would indicate the outcome of another public tendering process would differ dramatically. I contend that there cannot be any extra evidence unless there is a tender. The Minister needs to put the needs of the people on the island first and should meet representatives of Comharchumann Forbartha Árann Teoranta, as they may have the evidence sought by the Department. His first priority should be a year-round sustainable service to Inis Mór in order that they can continue to develop the island economically, socially, etc. I call on the Minister of State to ask another Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, to intervene and meet representatives of the co-op as soon as possible in this regard.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	148	I welcome the Minister of State. Although this issue is not directly connected to his Department, it is an extremely important matter in the north side of Cork city. There is a proposed amalgamation and reconfiguration of schools in the area and one is Scoil Mhuire Fatima, or North Mon. That school has 170 students and no infant classes; if it had a full complement, it would probably have over 200 students because the infant classes are dealt with at the North Presentation school and St. Vincent's school. When this proposal arose, there was no consultation with parents, teachers or boards of management. The proposal is for the amalgamation of North Mon with St. Vincent's and there is major concern among parents and teachers that the facilities at St. Vincent's are inadequate with regard to play areas, for example. The proposal would also have a Gaelscoil at Farranferris move to North Mon. There is concern that the proposal seems to be going ahead with little or no consultation with parents, teachers or the principals of the schools. I attended a meeting of over 250 parents recently and major concerns were expressed. The Minister should get involved in the issue as there is no support for the proposal as it currently exists. The Gaelscoil could still be accommodated at North Mon without the primary school moving to St. Vincent's. This concern has been expressed by parents, teachers and the principal at North Mon. It should be taken on board by the Minister.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15058	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	149	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. As a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills and being from Cork, I am very much aware of the issue at hand. I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it offers us the opportunity to clarify the current position on the proposed amalgamation and reconfiguration of primary schools on the north side of Cork city. I advise the Senator that we are aware that a consultation process has been initiated involving North Presentation primary school, St. Vincent's girls' primary school, Scoil Mhuire Fatima - or North Mon primary school - and Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers. As the Senator may be aware, the initiative for any amalgamation or reconfiguration of schools may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and patrons. Any such proposal must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level. In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities, which is a key point, and contributes to an inclusive education system. It is a matter for the relevant school authorities, including the parents and school community, to arrive at a satisfactory outcome. I confirm that although the decision making authority for the amalgamation of any school belongs to the patron of the schools concerned, such a proposal is then subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. With regard to the primary school amalgamation and reconfiguration being proposed, I understand details of this proposal has recently been sent to the boards of management, staff and parents of the four schools involved. It is understood that when the consultation process is concluded, the trustees of the schools concerned will make a recommendation to the patron for his decision in the matter. In that regard, I confirm that to date the Minister has not received any proposal from the patron or trustees in the matter.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the current position.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	150	There is some confusion about who is the patron. My understanding is that North Mon is owned by the Christian Brothers and they have decided to move the school. Will the Minister of State clarify who is the patron? If the legal owners decide that this is what they want and if the parents, teachers, board of management and principal of the school are not in favour of the proposal, where does that leave the Department?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15058	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-27 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	151	It is very difficult to answer that question as there is a certain amount of theory involved. If no proposal has been received by the Minister to date, this is still very much a localised process. With regard to who is the patron, I would have thought the answer could be divined through the various schools involved in the process. In the absence of any application, correspondence or proposal to the Department or Minister, it could be argued that we are blind to any proposal. Therefore, notwithstanding the level of public sentiment expressed at the public meeting about the process, no clarification or correspondence has been provided to us either at a political or departmental level. We await such correspondence, should it arise. The question of the patron remains to be answered and perhaps I can provide assistance to the Senator in due course.

It was alleged that one party was a patron but that party denied it. The issue should be clarified.
