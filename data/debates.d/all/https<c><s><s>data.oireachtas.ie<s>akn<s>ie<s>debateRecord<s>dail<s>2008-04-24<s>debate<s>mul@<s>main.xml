        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat of closure of our unique boglands, with the ensuing loss of an essential part of our heritage and the huge implications for employment of our turf-cutters, many generations of whom made their livelihoods from cutting turf in rural Ireland as others do to the present day; and the adverse economic impact and the environmental threat to flora and fauna native to such bogs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance requiring urgent consideration, namely, the fact that the orthopaedic service at Cork University Hospital was allocated just 100 outpatient referrals under the national treatment purchase fund for 2008; that this allocation has already been filled; that no additional referrals can now be made until 2009 and that patients are suffering as a result.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the seizure of heroin worth €250,000 in Walkinstown, which while welcome is also another reminder that the heroin crisis continues; the further examples of drug-related crime including a pipe-bomb in Crumlin and a drive-by shooting in Limerick all of which took place in the past 24 hours; the need for the Government to acknowledge and fully recognise its failure to resource and implement the national drugs strategy which is now in its final months as a starting point for future progress and to encourage communities, those involved in frontline service delivery and all those affected by drugaddiction to participate in the upcoming public consultation meetings on a future drugsstrategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the fact that 9,600 children are on a waiting list for the BCG vaccination in the Cork area.  Over the past two years there has been a rise in TB notifications in the HSE south region with 96 cases notified in 2006 and 110 cases in 2007 — the highest level of incidence in the country — and yesterday a new case of TB was confirmed at one of the largest schools in Cork city.  Cork is the only county where the BCG vaccination, which inoculates against TB, is not routinely administered to newborns and, despite assurances that additional clinics would be set up to deal with the backlog, only 30 children are being vaccinated each week, which is less than the number of children born at the Cork University Maternity Hospital during the same period and therefore the waiting list continues to grow.  I request a debate on this issue.</p>

The Government recently increased the number of Ministers of State by three, increased the number of Oireachtas committees by three and an order is soon to be made whereby Ministers will receive huge increases in pay without regard to performance or productivity, including the Tánaiste, who will be due €38,000 if he is then Taoiseach.

          <p eId="para_19">Regarding the court case yesterday, an all-party committee is considering in what way matters can be advanced beyond the legislation we were obliged to enact following the C case in 2006, which permitted the defence of honest mistake as to age in cases where the essence of the defence related to the age of the person.

          <p eId="para_27">I wish to raise three matters.  As regards the issue raised by Deputy Bruton concerning child protection and the age of consent, an Oireachtas committee made a total of 61 recommendations on this area some time ago, none of which appears to have been implemented.  Will the Tánaiste say what plans the Government has to implement those recommendations while the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is still considering the more complicated issue of the promised amendment?</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published new proposals to tighten the law as regards the sale and abuse of alcohol.  They are obviously welcome and I should like if the Tánaiste could indicate when those proposals might be brought before the House.  I also want to ask about legislation already enacted, but which has not been implemented, including provisions for the traceability of drink, particularly drink sold in off-licences, and plans to have such stock labelled so that it can be traced.  Then there is the legislation enacted to allow for on-the-spot fines for drunken behaviour in public places, which has not been implemented either.  When will the Government implement the legislation that has already been enacted?</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The third matter relates to the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which I have raised before, and Deputy Burton raised it with the Taoiseach on Tuesday.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is due to retire on 14 May.  His replacement has to be nominated and approved by this House for appointment by the President.  To date, my party has not been informed as regards the plans or procedures the Government intends to apply to the proposal for a new Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have not been consulted although we have raised the matter here a couple of times before this.  I should like to know what is happening.  We do not want to find ourselves simply being presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> here some morning.  This is an important constitutional office dealing with oversight of Government spending and the country’s money.  Obviously, it has a critical role as regards the waste of public expenditure, as well.  We have not been consulted on this to date and we want to be.  Will the Tánaiste please tell the House what plans there are in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I had a meeting with the incumbent Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, only yesterday.  He outlined to me the outcome of interviews which had taken place for that post.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide upon, and the President will make the appointment on foot of that.  As a result of that discussion yesterday, I intend to be in touch with the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Gilmore to explain the outcome of that meeting, to see whether we can provide a candidate arising from that.  I shall report to the Deputy on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">On the legislative matters the Deputy talked about, I understand the Minister envisages the heads of the Bill spoken about in the last couple of days will reflect the requirement to bring people to the Garda station before an on-the-spot fine can be applied.  He believes this is a necessary safeguard, and it will be incorporated in the Bill which it is hoped to have as soon as possible, hopefully this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Regarding the all-party committee, an issue arose yesterday in the courts.  Again, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be the best person to answer parliamentary questions on the detail of  this.

It is a very important position.  We have seen the work of the Committee of Public Accounts over the years and the reports on the waste of public expenditure.  This is an important and sensitive position.  I understand the Tánaiste to be saying there is now some type of selection process under way to identify a new Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is the first we have heard of it, there has been no public advertising of the post and it has been asked about here on a number of occasions.  In fact, when Deputy Burton asked about it on Tuesday, the Taoiseach seemed to think that this was an appointment which was in the gift of the Government and that it would not arise until July.  Now we are being told that some type of selection process is under way, and I should like to hear more about that.  This is an important constitutional position.</p>

The senior citizens' organisations appear to have received some kind of assurance that the Bill will be published by the end of April because they say so in their newsletters.

I understand a review has been completed on the operation of the Competition Act 2004, particularly section 4.  It was understood that the Government was preparing its own legislative response to the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill.  The Taoiseach indicated during the previous round of talks with the social partners that he would like the matter resolved.  I refer to the use by the HSE of section 4 of the Competition Act 2004 to undermine the Trade Union Acts in order to strike down the possibility of collective representation.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I addressed the House on the issue of cancer services on 12 March, following the publication of the reports on the misdiagnosis of nine women in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  On that occasion I expressed my deep regret to the women and their families.  Once again I reiterate this regret and offer sincere apologies to all those women and their families who are the subjects of the various reports we are discussing today.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">We must never forget that our health system must have the treatment and welfare of the patient as its central focus.  Health service staff must at all times strive to deliver quality driven, patient-centred care.  In turn, staff must be supported by management in an environment where the highest standards of care are fostered, where there is teamwork and where roles and responsibilities are clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Of course, in the context of cancer care a prerequisite to a quality driven service is the multidisciplinary team providing initial diagnosis and treatment.  Evidence has shown that where women are treated for breast cancer in a multidisciplinary quality environment survival rates can improve by as much as 20%.  In each of the cases reviewed multidisciplinary teams were not present.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The key findings of the reports in Portlaoise were as follows.  There were no multidisciplinary team meetings other than in oncology and consultant medical staff were not represented at the meeting that decided to suspend breast radiology services.  There was confusion regarding roles and responsibilities in the hospital and there were gaps in decision-making processes.  There was a fundamental weakness in the management and governance of the review process because no authoritative co-ordination role was established for the process as a whole.  Decision-making was fragmented, communications were inconsistent and there were too many individuals involved, which led to confusion about the status of the overall review process.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Since that date two other reports have been published.  The review of the clinical care of patients who presented to the symptomatic breast disease service at Barringtons Hospital, Limerick, was published on 1 April, and the independent investigation by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into the care provided by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to Rebecca O'Malley at the Cork University Hospital and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, was published on 2 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I received a report from the HSE on 31 July 2007 relating to the misdiagnosis of breast cancer in a woman who resides in the mid-western region.  The patient, Ms A, had presented to Barringtons Hospital, Limerick, initially in 2005 and again in 2007.  The HSE's specific concern related to two pathology tests performed on behalf of Ms A that were carried out on behalf of Barringtons Hospital in University College Hospital, Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">On 7 August 2007, HIQA announced that it would undertake a review of pathology services at University College Hospital, Galway, which would include establishing the facts about this aspect of the patient's care.  It is anticipated that this review will conclude shortly.  On 9 August, HIQA informed my Department's chief medical officer about concerns relating to the adequacy of the management and care of ten women who attended the breast disease services at Barringtons Hospital within the past four years.  On 10 August, the chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer of my Department, on my behalf, met Barringtons Hospital and requested it to suspend the delivery of breast services, and it agreed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">It was agreed by the hospital that an independent clinical review was required into the clinical care of patients who presented at the symptomatic breast disease service at Barringtons Hospital between September 2003 and August 2007.  The review team was chaired by Dr. Henrietta Campbell, a former chief medical officer in Northern Ireland.  As I said, the report was published on 1 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The report found that hospital records identified 331 patients falling within the remit of the review.  Of these, 285 patients consented to the review.  Following assessment of all available records, the review team concluded that in its opinion, the diagnosis and treatment of 139 patients was entirely appropriate and there was no need for further assessment.  In a further 118 cases, it was the clinical and professional judgment of the review team that the level of clinical care was not always what it considered appropriate.  However, in none of these cases was a diagnosis of cancer missed or delayed and in no case was a diagnosis of cancer wrongly given.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The report concludes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_206">whilst it is not considered that any of these patients have come to lasting harm, the review team is of the opinion that many of these patients could have been managed differently.  In some women with benign disease, operative intervention would not have been required if appropriate investigations had been undertaken prior to surgery.  In other cases where cancer was present, definitive surgery should have been undertaken as one procedure rather than in two stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">In two patients, a diagnosis of cancer was delayed for a significant period from initial presentation, potentially causing serious harm.  In 26 cases it was concluded that these patients should be referred for further investigations to exclude the possibility of breast cancer.  In most of these cases the referral was regarded as a precautionary measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The report emphasises the importance of triple assessment, that is, a joint assessment carried out on a multidisciplinary basis by a pathologist, a radiologist and a surgeon.  Triple assessment was not available in Barringtons Hospital and as a result some patients may have undergone unnecessary surgery while others did not receive definitive surgery based on the results of normally expected pre-operative diagnosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The findings of HIQA's first investigation into the care provided for Rebecca O'Malley by the HSE were published on 2 April.  The main finding of the report is that the interpretive error made by a consultant pathologist that led to the initial misdiagnosis was a single mistake of human error.  However, the report notes the absence of a triple assessment review in the centre, which led to missed opportunities to correct the error.  The report is also critical of the HSE on governance, management and communications and the way in which Rebecca O'Malley was informed of matters relevant to her care.  In total, the report contains 15 recommendations, including matters relating to clinical practice and management.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">One of the most important things about any review is that we learn from the exercise and apply that learning throughout the service.  All reports highlight the need for swift implementation of the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services, which I approved last year under the Health Act 2007.  The implementation of the standards will ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre that is capable of delivering the best possible results.  The standards need to be applied to all hospitals, both public and private, that provide symptomatic breast disease services.  I strongly believe that symptomatic breast services should be provided only in hospitals that meet these standards in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">My Department wrote to the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland and the private health insurers, on my behalf, last August, enclosing a copy of the standards, and I subsequently had discussions with them relating to these matters.  The standards will clearly have implications for some private facilities.  Some have already ceased providing symptomatic breast services.  I continue to encourage hospitals in the independent sector to take the necessary steps to ensure that their breast cancer services comply with the standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The HSE has designated eight centres for symptomatic breast disease services.  The HSE National Hospitals Office will shortly transfer full responsibility for symptomatic breast services to the national cancer control programme, which is being overseen by Professor Tom Keane.  The programme recently completed a detailed review of resource requirements to create capacity for the progressive transfer of all symptomatic breast cancer services to the eight designated centres with the objective of completing 60% of the transfer by the end of this year and 90% by the end of 2009.  Funding of €5.8 million has been allocated across the eight centres from the programme to support additional staff, including consultant, radiography, nursing and clerical posts.  Funding has also been allocated for some necessary additional equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Two other reports have yet to be published.  One is the investigation by HIQA into pathology services at University College Hospital, Galway, which commenced in September 2007.  While it is difficult to predict precisely at this stage when the work will be completed, it is hoped that the investigation will be concluded shortly and the report will be published as soon as possible thereafter.  The other is the pathology review in Cork University Hospital, which is completed.  A report is being finalised by the HSE in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Following the discovery of a small number of errors in the reading of X-rays, the HSE invited a panel of experts from the UK to assess the need for a review of the radiology services in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The panel recommended a review and work is progressing in identifying its full scope.  It will be carried out in accordance with the HSE's recently adopted policy on serious incident management.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">If the recent reports and reviews have taught us anything, it is that we must fully support the establishment of the national cancer control programme and ensure it is established by the HSE without delay.  The HSE has designated four managed cancer control networks.  For the first time in Ireland, we have a national leader in cancer control.  I have full faith in Professor Keane in delivering on this programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The decisions of the HSE to designate four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to cancer centres by end 2008 and 80% to 90% by end 2009.  Professor Keane is in discussions with the HSE to take control of all new cancer developments and progressively all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure patients receive the highest quality care while allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Cancer day-care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the programme, including the appointment on a part-time basis of national clinical leaders in surgical, medical and radiation oncology; cessation of breast cancer surgery in 16 hospitals with low volumes; agreement with the surgical leads in the eight designated breast cancer centres on a transparent and evidence-based resourcing mechanism, benchmarked to best practice; the move to a common referral process, supported by the Irish College of General Practitioners, which will allow urgent patients to be seen within two weeks; the elimination of unnecessary follow-up of previously treated asymptomatic patients; agreement with the Irish Cancer Society on the administration of a grants programme to enable patients to be transported to designated cancer centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">A new era of patient safety has begun in health care.  We have started out on a path from which there is no return, the path of setting and implementing objective standards of care.  It is a long road ahead, with many milestones yet to pass.  It will involve all health care settings; the organisation of services between hospitals as well as within hospitals.  We have taken some of the most important steps, that is, the first steps in the journey.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Three key milestones in legislation have already been passed.  A statutory body responsible for standard setting and monitoring, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has been established.  A year ago, we enacted the first major overhaul in 30 years of the law regulating the medical profession through the Medical Council.  A new Pharmacy Act has been enacted to regulate the pharmacy profession.  All legislation has been driven by patient safety and the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The journey also involves honestly describing where mistakes and failures have occurred or do occur and to learn and improve from them.  That requires a blame-free reporting and management culture.  I am determined that we operate in an open way, that we implement improvements from mistakes and that the hue and cry of a search for blame does not undermine what really needs to be done in patients' interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Patient safety and standards setting are powerful drivers of reform and improvement in services for patients.  These are at least as powerful drivers of change as finance, staffing levels and working time issues.  We are making patient safety — the best possible diagnosis and best possible outcomes — drive our decisions in cancer care.  We shall see the results of this clearly.  The patient safety agenda will be implemented without distinction between public and private patients.  My concern as Minister for Health and Children is for all patients in all settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Government is aware of the significant issues relating to patient safety and is treating the matter as a priority.  We are committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health service possible, doing so effectively and efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Some time ago I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  Membership of the commission is made up of medical and nursing representatives, management and, importantly, two representatives of patients and carers.  The commission is chaired by Dr. Deirdre Madden BL, a leading expert on medical law and ethics.  The commission is due to report to me in the summer.  Among the issues it will address will be the need for a licensing regime for health provision.   Short of such a regime, we will not be in a position to enforce the standards on a mandatory or legislative basis in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">I have set out the broad policy framework that I want to put in place and the main findings resulting from the recent reports on cancer.  Professor Keane has set himself ambitious targets for his two-year tenure as director of the national cancer control programme.  He has quickly set about realigning cancer services to ensure a person can be assured of the highest quality service.  He is receiving buy-in to the plan from clinicians across the country.  The emerging clinical leadership will be the greatest guarantee that the plan will be implemented without delay.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_226">Today we discuss the findings of the Rebecca O'Malley report, the Barringtons Hospital report and the Fitzgerald, Doherty and O'Doherty reports into the Portlaoise cancer crisis.  All these reports are a damning indictment of 11 years of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats policy, now supported by the Green Party.  In the past three years, we have had a health policy run by a Minister who engages in a semi-detached oversight, fails to accept responsibility and does not recognise the concept of accountability for the appalling failures in our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Continued revelations of appalling mistakes in diagnosis and treatment of individual patients, discussed by the media on a daily basis, have totally undermined patient confidence in our health services.  Excellent work done by so many nurses and doctors who save lives and improve the quality of lives gets lost in people's consciousness by the increasing doubt created about the competency of our overall diagnostic and treatment services.  It has reached a stage whereby many people genuinely in need of hospital care are frightened to enter hospital for inpatient treatment.  Those reliant on diagnostic and inpatient services lack confidence in results furnished to them and feel compelled to seek second and third opinions to ensure they are not the victim of yet another error.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The legacy of 13 years of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is not only that we have a health service that falls scandalously below the standard expected in an EU-advanced economy but that a majority of people totally lack confidence in the capacity of the service to provide them with appropriate, timely, reliable and competent diagnostic and medical services.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">As I have been allocated a short time, I can only draw on the more prominent aspects of the reports.  I hope that as a result of recent events detailed in these reports real lessons have been learned and real reforms are implemented.  However, considering the promises made by the Government in that regard, the Fine Gael Party has little confidence in the Minister or the current management and structure of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The Fitzgerald report catalogued the systemic failures in the HSE's response to the Portlaoise cancer crisis.  Fitzgerald found "a fundamental weakness in the management and governance of the process from the outset because there was no authoritative co-ordination and management role established for the review process as a whole."  Communication throughout the period was inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, too many people were involved from different levels and areas in the HSE who were unclear of their roles and responsibilities and they had differing understandings of what was going on.  His report also found that the entire management process surrounding the Portlaoise cancer crisis has been a bungling mess from start to finish.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Fitzgerald found a lack of urgency from the HSE prior to the Oireachtas health committee meeting on 22 November 2007 when it was announced that 97 women reviewed under the ultrasound process needed to be recalled.  These women were not contacted immediately but were treated like job lots and left until a sufficient cohort was accumulated before they were contacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Minister for Health and Children was unaware of the ultrasound review until the day before the committee sat.  In the intervening period, between the time she learned and the time the committee sat, she was unable to get detailed information from the HSE, a body which she created and which should directly report to her on health issues of national importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">One would assume that when the issue broke last autumn this was the first time the HSE and the Department of Health and Children knew of the problems in Portlaoise General Hospital.  We subsequently learnt that a consultant surgeon in Portlaoise General Hospital, Dr. Peter Naughton, had written a series of letters to the Minister, Deputy Harney, and her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Martin, dated as far back as 2002, expressing his substantial concerns about the cancer services in that hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">In July 2005 he stated that radiological services were being provided by people who had no expertise in the area and that women were having unnecessary surgery because of a lack of decision-making.  He described the services as a shambles.  It is scandalous that nothing changed, no one took responsibility and no decisions were made.  The correspondence was apparently ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The frightening findings of the Fitzgerald report were echoed in the report published by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into events surrounding the misdiagnosis of Rebecca O'Malley.  The report catalogues a series of systemic failures in the organisation and the handling of the situation.  Roles and responsibilities within hospitals and HSE management were not sufficiently understood, no one took lead responsibility for the situation, pathways of accountability and reporting at senior management level were not clear, there was insufficient understanding of risk management at all levels, communication between management and staff was not effective and there was a lack of confidence in the integrity of the communications process.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Of all the failings identified, it is particularly worrying that responsibility was left to Rebecca O'Malley to pursue her case.  She made the hospital aware of her concerns in an incident form completed in November 2006, but it did not trigger an effectively managed action plan.  There was no integrated system-wide approach, a lead individual to manage the overall response or a system to respond to her letters in a timely manner.  It was left to her, through sheer frustration and determination, to pursue the issue, to raise questions regarding errors in her care and to bring this terrible error to the nation's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">According to the report, there was a collective lack of accountability, cohesion and focus on the needs of the patient.  This is the so-called patient-focused health system to which the Minister refers frequently.  It is unacceptable that a person who suspects a misdiagnosis or has concerns about his or her health should be treated in such a manner.  It is unacceptable that these concerns, which could reflect on the health of others, could be ignored.  It seems almost unbelievable that, in the construction and framing of the new HSE system for which the Minister is directly accountable and responsible, such policies and procedures were not considered and effective systems put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The report found that major financial pressures demanded management time and energy, creating the potential for other priorities to be given less attention.  Perhaps patient care and safety are a priority to which the HSE has, in the years since its establishment, failed to give adequate attention.  They seem to be less important than the HSE's bureaucratic and administrative priorities, which are occasionally more concerned with covering up or ignoring difficulties than with investigating them.  Most damning was the HIQA findings on the HSE's governance and management of the situation.  According to the report, disillusionment with the role of the HSE was a consistent feature in most of the interviews.  It found that the HSE network management system does not have the confidence of its staff and that the new system delayed decision making processes instead of facilitating them.  This matter must be addressed.  I am not reassured by the Minister's statement, which we have heard previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">HIQA found a disconnect between hospital management and the HSE's National Hospitals Office in that the HSE expects hospitals to accept without question significantly increased workloads that are unmatched by resources or staff.  This is a consistent theme across the health system.  The sad reality is that patient-centred care is a low priority in the day-to-day workings of the health service and in the approach taken by the HSE.  The report concludes that the HSE is designed in such a way as to delay and avoid difficult decision making and to prioritise emergency issues that have the media's attention rather than to meet the local needs of patients and frontline staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Combined, the reports demonstrate that the Minister's claim concerning her presiding over a health system that puts patients first is false.  Instead of attributing responsibility to an individual, the reports refer to systemic failures.  The Minister stated her desire for a reporting culture in which no blame is attached.  The Minister, HSE management and those employed in the health service cannot be free of blame.  They must be accountable for the service they deliver to the public and recognise their responsibility.  If something goes wrong, there must be accountability.  If there is none, there will be further scandals and tragedies as a consequence of the HSE's failures.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">For months, we have listened to the Minister's plans for eight cancer centres of excellence.  No one can disagree with the concept of excellence in cancer care or the proposals, but I cannot understand how the Minister can justifiably withdraw excellent cancer services from hospitals around the country when alternative and replacement infrastructure has not been put in place at the new centres.  If the Government has a serious intent to establish centres of excellence, it must fully address issues concerning those hospitals where cancer services are to be terminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Back bench Deputies and, more importantly, Ministers should stop playing cynical local political games, namely, pretending to fight to keep cancer services in hospitals in their local constituencies while coming to Dublin and voting for closures.  The conduct of the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, in this regard is particularly reprehensible.  As a Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, he can directly contribute to the decisions being made on cancer policy and services.  His cynical and self-promoting presence at protests to maintain services at Sligo General Hospital when he is in a position as a Minister of State to ensure those services are maintained — if doing so is consistent with providing the expert medical care to which cancer patients are entitled — is nothing short of farcical.  By his conduct, he is undermining any credibility vested in his position.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">We do not know when the cancer centres of excellence will be fully operational.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has given some indication of the general progress proposed by the HSE, but we do not know the details.  For example, we do not know how much additional funding will be dedicated to these centres, how many extra beds will be needed, whether beds will be relocated or whether new beds will be created.  How many staff are expected to move under the proposed plan and how many new staff will be recruited?   What arrangements will be made for hospitals north of the Galway-Dublin line?  What arrangements will be made to facilitate patients who cannot afford the cost of travelling to the centres of excellence?  When will the national radiation oncology plan be delivered and by what method of financing?  How can patient safety be prioritised when services, be they cancer or other health services such as those in the north east, are withdrawn without alternative services being put in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The reports published in recent months prove that patients are not put first, HSE management is anything but effective and, three years since its establishment, people are still unclear of their roles and responsibilities.  The reports establish that there is not an appropriate, up-to-date and effective communication system between the HSE and its many segments and the Minister and her Department.  At times, the Minister seems to discover difficulties or disasters more speedily via media reports than via direct communication between her Department and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Discussing the establishment of the HSE in November 2004, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_246">It is a once-in-a-generation event.  It is our generation's chance to put patients first in the design of the management of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">She stated: "To achieve them we badly need clarity of roles and accountability — political responsibility for the Minister and management responsibility for the management" and "That will make a real difference to the quality of health services provided for our people".  In the years since the HSE's establishment, the Minister has not only failed to deliver in this respect, but the situation has gone wrong.  Members on all sides of the House lack confidence of any nature in the capacity of the HSE to deliver a competent health service.  Our confidence is further diminished by the HSE's tendency under financial pressure to cut frontline services while preserving an overwhelming, unnecessary and overlapping bureaucracy.  We need a health service that is not about bloated bureaucracy and ineffective management structures, but patient values and how we cherish our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">None of the reports reflects the worries and anxieties experienced by each of the women involved or the dreadful impact events have had on them.  Some reactionary action was taken by the Minister in response to the situation, but the HSE has failed to create real public trust in its capability.  The investigation team behind the O'Malley report stated that an urgent review should be conducted by corporate HSE of communications within its hospitals to ensure effective communications policies and procedures are in place to provide an efficient and co-ordinated response to the patient when a serious incident occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Minister should take heed of this and initiate such a review to ensure the appropriate and necessary changes are introduced as a priority.  In addition, the Minister should finally recognise that the HSE, as created by her, is a failed organisation whose structure does not lend itself to the delivery of an appropriate and efficient quality health service.  The present need for root and branch reform of the HSE and the manner in which it conducts its business must be recognised.  Moreover, there is a requirement to ensure that the vast resources which are going into the health service are being used to provide frontline patient care and not to continue building an unnecessarily large administration and bureaucracy, which operates in a world in which it seems on occasion that not only does the right hand not know what the left hand is doing but has not yet been introduced to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">There is an old saying that sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.  However, the corollary is that words will not heal me either.  Members again heard an eloquent speech this morning from the Minister for Health and Children.  The version circulated to Members concluded with the line: "This is the framework and policy agenda that the Government is pursuing with the ultimate aim of delivering safer care and treatment for all who use our health services."  If eloquence could deliver a good health service, the Minister would be doing a great job, but unfortunately it cannot.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, undoubtedly is a very elegant, or rather eloquent, Minister for Health and Children.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Although the Minister speaks eloquently, unfortunately eloquence and fine words do not deliver an excellent health service.  It seems likely the Minister, Deputy Harney, will remain as Minister for Health and Children after the incoming Taoiseach takes office in two weeks.  It is almost unbelievable that the reason she will remain as Minister for Health and Children is that no one else wants the job.  No one else, in the very large Fianna Fáil Party or in the Green Party wants the job.  They are leaving it to the Minister, Deputy Harney, whose party has the support of 1% of the electorate.  This is an appalling indictment of the Government.  The Minister is being left there because the others do not want the post rather than because they consider her to be doing a good job as Minister for Health and Children.  Certainly, the Minister talks a good talk, but if she is as detached from the real reforming work as she appears to be in respect of the HSE or if she is as detached in respect of the delivery of the cancer strategy, the new Taoiseach will have failed unless he replaces her as Minister for Health and Children.  This is the responsibility of the Government rather than of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I will begin where Deputy Shatter left off in respect of the HSE.  It is important to establish what the Minister said in November 2004 when the HSE was established.  Again, fine words were used, but what has been delivered?  If it has not been delivered with regard to the HSE, will it be delivered in respect of the cancer strategy?  Members have a responsibility to ensure that what is stated and promised in this House is delivered and I take this duty seriously as a spokesperson for the Opposition and for the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Members need a Minister who does what the Minister, Deputy Harney, promised in the Dáil in November 2004 when the legislation setting up the HSE was being rushed through.  She stated she would retain clear accountability for our health services.  However, on a daily basis, one sees the Minister and her partners in government shirking their responsibility for the health services, as well as blaming and criticising the HSE.  I refer to the words used in 2004, not the action.  The Minister promised that the HSE would bring efficiency, value for money and a scaling down of bureaucracy.  One of the guiding principles was to be a move away from care in hospitals and institutions to care in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">However, a nationwide litany of evidence has emerged this week that the opposite is happening and that those vital supports that make the difference between a family being able to care for a loved one at home as opposed to in a hospital or an institution are being reduced.  This week alone there have been accounts of the closure of respite and rehabilitation beds in Leopardstown Park, Dublin, which is located in Deputy Shatter's constituency.  I visited the north east last week and was informed that St. Oliver's, Dundalk, must close its respite and rehabilitation beds.  One hears of reduced home help throughout the country and yesterday I learned of the ending of the hospital in the home scheme, which had been operating in the Dublin area.  There is a failure to fill vacancies in occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy posts and a wide variety of other support services within the community, while waiting lists of two years and longer exist for some of the aforementioned therapies.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Last night I discussed a family in County Kildare with one of my colleagues.  The father is blind and has a series of health complaints and there are three intellectually disabled young adults in the family.  Incredibly, the family has had its home care support service withdrawn.  The events I have just recounted demonstrate that matters are going in the opposite direction to what was promised by the Minister in this Chamber in November 2004 before the establishment of the HSE.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for families to keep their sick relatives out of hospital and this piles on pressure in an acute system that is bursting at the seams.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">If eloquence and promises could deliver a good health service, Ireland would have one, but unfortunately they cannot.  I make this point in the context of this debate on cancer services because Members again have heard an eloquently presented and convincing verbal picture of a vision of what should be put in place.  The most important question is how to get from the present position to such a point.  The Minister provided that fine line about the ultimate aim of delivering safer care and treatment for all who use our health services.  She also referred to Professor Tom Keane and what he will do during his two-year term.  Moreover, she referred to the establishment of the cancer strategy and noted that the HSE has designated eight centres.  She stated: "The HSE National Hospitals Office will shortly transfer full responsibility for symptomatic breast services to the national cancer control programme".</p>
          <p eId="para_263">This constitutes further long-distance management from the Minister.  As Minister, she is responsible.  She set up the HSE and appears to have washed her hands of how it operates.  The HSE now intends to set up the national cancer control programme and, presumably, it will be given a budget.  However, in two years' time, Professor Tom Keane will have returned to Canada.  How will Members then ensure the recommendations contained in the reports before the House today are implemented?  Will Members then be informed that, regrettably, it was not possible to implement all the recommendations of the Rebecca O'Malley report because the national cancer control programme did not use its budget wisely?  Will they be informed, for example, that triple assessment in Waterford, appropriate equipment in Limerick or the provision of a service for the people of the north west cannot be ensured?  Members require an absolute assurance from the Minister that in contrast to her actions regarding the HSE, she will take responsibility for this programme.  Otherwise, a new Minister is required.  The most important issue pertains to delivery of this programme rather than to the painting of a fine picture with fine words.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">How does one move from the reality of what was described in the three reports on Portlaoise to the failure to diagnose cancer in nine women and informing 97 others over the airwaves and through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, instead of personally, that they could have cancer?  How does one deal with the reality of the systematic shortcomings and inadequate resources that led to the misdiagnosis of Rebecca O'Malley and Ms. X in Limerick and Cork, respectively, or the reality of misdiagnosis in Barringtons Hospital and UCHG?  How does one move from such issues to a reliable, safe service that is trusted by the people of Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Minister referred to hue and cry and a search for blame.  This is not a hue and cry or a search for blame, it is a search for responsibility and accountability and an ongoing process to monitor and ensure that what is planned will be put in place.  I welcome the comments of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, representatives of which appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children last Tuesday, that it intends to visit all the aforementioned centres and set out standards in respect of what should be available.  Ultimately, however, HIQA does not have the teeth to ensure the resources are put in place to make this happen.  The Minister should give a commitment that she, or whoever succeeds her, will come into this Chamber on a regular basis to outline progress on these reports.  She should ensure ongoing monitoring and that the requisite resources are available.  It cannot operate like the HSE, where everything is blamed on the executive but no responsibility is taken in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I ask the Minister for precise answers on how she will be accountable for implementing the recommendations in the various reports on her desk.  The public must be informed of the timeframe, staffing, governance systems and resources and who will have responsibility and authority to ensure that what is needed at all levels is in place.  Rebecca O'Malley stated at the press conference to launch the HIQA report on her misdiagnosis that the system to protect the patient did not fail because there was no system.  We will have failed Rebecca and many others if the fine words which were uttered in this Parliament are not translated into action.  We need to hear precisely how each of the 15 recommendations of the HIQA report will be implemented and the timeframe for doing so.  The system for monitoring progress on each element of the recommendations needs to be explained and the person with responsibility for ensuring each step is taken must be identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Opposition has agreed to support the cancer strategy but our support is not uncritical.  We do not agree, for example, with the plan to leave the entire part of the country north of a line from Galway to Dublin without a specialist centre.  We insist that the money is delivered to fulfil the promise made by the Taoiseach to the people of the south east in advance of the general election that Waterford Regional Hospital would be developed and resourced sufficiently to provide everything required of a proper centre of excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I will misquote the Ceann Comhairle by saying this debate is not the end of the focus on the reports on cancer misdiagnosis, it is the end of the beginning of an ongoing process of providing a safe and comprehensive cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment service.  That is why I want an undertaking from the Minister that she will take a hands-on and focused approach rather than operate at a distance of three steps from the HSE, the cancer control programme and the various centres.  Otherwise, nobody will take responsibility for implementing these reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The BreastCheck programme has not yet been rolled out in my county and we do not expect it this year because we are being serviced by a mobile unit.  Several other counties in the south and west also lack BreastCheck screening.  I want an assurance from the Minister that the programme will be rolled out as quickly as possible because we are at risk currently.  There is no mammography service in my own region except where patients are referred to the symptomatic breast centre by their GPs but even in that case patients face a long waiting list unless their symptoms are urgent.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I also want an assurance that the cervical screening programme will be rolled out within the indicative timeframe.  I have concerns about the plan that appears to be on the cards for sending cytology abroad.  At least two centres in Ireland are undergoing the process of accreditation and I urge the Minister to give them the resources they need to meet the requisite standards so that we do not lose their expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The cancer control programme is meant to be full and comprehensive but a full hospice palliative care service is not yet in place throughout the country.  I want a commitment that the resources will be made available so that the care can be provided.  People should not be disadvantaged merely because they live in a certain part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The OECD recently highlighted statistics that suggest Ireland is at the lower end of the scale on a range of cancers, including breast, prostate, cervical and colorectal cancers.  It is important that all aspects of cancer are included, not just the areas highlighted in our deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">In regard to the late Susie Long and the importance of a system that is fair to everybody, irrespective of whether one is a public or private patient, I want an assurance from the Minister that public patients will not have to wait so long that their health and lives are put at risk.  There should be no discrepancy between public and private patients and, for that reason, the Labour Party has put forward a proposal for universal health insurance so that everybody will be on the same waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Ultimately, responsibility must be taken for implementation as opposed to the vision of the cancer strategy.  Due tribute would be paid to the women whose lives were put at risk from misdiagnoses by implementing in full the recommendations of the reports before us.  The current Minister for Health and Children and her successors should take responsibility for implementing the reports and we will hold them accountable for doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Last month it was revealed that public patients are still facing waiting times of up to a year and a half for vital tests on suspected cancers, including colonoscopy examinations.  This is in spite of the false promises made by the Minister and the Taoiseach on improvements in cancer care, especially in the area of diagnostics.  Last October, Susie Long died of cancer after her diagnosis was delayed for months because she was on a waiting list for a colonoscopy.

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_280">It just seems much longer.  I feel weary thinking back on every day of the intervening period.  She bears direct responsibility for a situation whereby public patients with symptoms which might indicate cancer have to wait as long as 18 months for vital tests.  There is no excuse for this.  The Minister says it is unacceptable, and she is correct.  However, if it was unacceptable when she became Tánaiste in 1997, she has had a decade to address it.  She has failed and, while her Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government like to hide behind her skirts, they share her responsibility.  That is the context in which we discuss the latest reports on failures in cancer care delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The reports on the cases of Rebecca O'Malley and Barrington's Hospital can only be described as an indictment of the Health Service Executive and its management of cancer services.  Basic principles of patient care were violated by the HSE.  The right of patients to information about their cases and to prompt and meaningful responses to their concerns were denied.  In the report of its inquiry into the Rebecca O'Malley case the Health Information and Quality Authority stated: "The impression gained was of a system that delayed or avoided difficult decisions".  The report reveals that when Rebecca O'Malley raised her concerns about her misdiagnosis no real effort was made to assist her and inform her of the facts of her case and how it had been handled.  It was up to the patient to pursue the case through the system, which she did with great difficulty.  Publication after publication has documented the arduous and difficult steps that she had to take all along the way to try to establish the factual position and the "why" behind her particular experience.  No one within the hospital system or the HSE took the lead in responding to the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The HIQA report found "a collective lack of accountability, cohesion and focus on the needs of the patient".  When the report was issued, Rebecca O'Malley stated, and it deserves to be recorded again on the record of this House:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_283">I asserted myself and demanded answers to my reasonable questions.  The system responded to my efforts by erecting, through ignorance or inertia, a wall of deafening silence that is so typical of the walls that patients regularly have to climb in an arduous effort to make the health system accountable to the very people it exists to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The HIQA report demonstrates that the system failures with regard to patient care and properly informing patients who were exposed in the Portlaoise breast cancer scandal are replicated across the hospital system for which the HSE is responsible.  The Barringtons Hospital report illustrates the lack of proper regulation and accountability of the private hospital system.  One media commentator put it very well when he said that "by over-centralising decision-making the HSE has emasculated regional managers to the point where front-line services are compromised".</p>
          <p eId="para_285">There is a point we must acknowledge.  Human error will occur in the delivery of health care — that is a fact and is inevitable.  No one should try to fool the people into thinking otherwise.  No system is perfect and better management cannot eliminate all instances of human error.  However, the system must be open and transparent.  It must be prepared to admit its mistakes and, above all, it must give patients full and frank information.  Clearly, we are looking at a substantive body of evidence that shows this is not the case with the current system.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The question to be posed is whether lessons will be learned.  With respect to the Minister, the signs are they will not.  As far as the HSE and the Government are concerned, ruthless centralisation is the name of the game in both the management of our health services and the delivery of care, particularly hospital care.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE are about to put in place a plan which will concentrate cancer care in just eight so-called centres of excellence, four of them in Dublin, leaving large swathes of the country without proper access.  Even in advance of this, services at local hospitals are being cut.  As was said earlier by Deputy Shatter, none of the proposed eight centres is located north of a line from Dublin to Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The term "centres of excellence" is and has been bandied about and something needs to be said about it.  We should start from the premise that every centre where cancer care of whatever type is delivered — I emphasise "of whatever type" — ought to be a centre of excellence.  They should all be centres of excellence.  By placing the emphasis on eight centres only, the Government and the HSE promote the belief that care delivery at other sites must be inferior, which is a dangerous fallacy.  It would also be a travesty if the reports under consideration today were to be used to promote the policy of over-centralisation, to which the Minister is clearly heavily committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I want to make the following point in regard to cancer care as I have made it in regard to a raft of acute hospital services, time after time in this Chamber and in other fora.  No one is arguing for radiation oncology facilities in every hospital in the country.  However, eight centres with such facilities are too few, and they are, as I and others have repeatedly pointed out, totally unbalanced in terms of regional spread, leaving much of the population very badly served or not served at all in real terms in my part of the island.  What is needed is a truly all-Ireland and regionally based cancer treatment service — I commend this approach to the Minister once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Radiation oncology should be delivered within the regions.  I have a very close and dear friend in St. Luke's from Monday of this week until Friday.  She will return home for the weekend and will return to the hospital for five days of each week for the following four weeks.  She is a very special and lovely person.  I know first-hand the terrible trauma she has suffered in terms of the preparation for this long absence and disconnect from her family and friends.  As in her case, other cancer sufferers are being subjected to long and painful journeys for treatment.  Many patients feel too ill to travel and choose not to avail of radiotherapy as a result, which is a terrible situation.  The resources are there, even in current straitened times, to deliver radiotherapy on a regional basis.  The Government needs to go back to the drawing board with its plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Cancer patients have been denied life-saving treatment because successive Governments have failed to provide the radiation oncology facilities required.  The Government has had ample time and a booming economy over many years to plan and budget for the provision of radiotherapy centres.  The State could and should have taken the lead and provided these centres directly as public facilities open to all and available and accessible on the basis of need alone.  Instead, the Government has committed itself to public private partnerships to deliver them, although it was then found these would take too long and a review was ordered.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, told us the planned centres may have to be provided entirely by the private sector.  Professor Drumm, on the other hand, has told us the public sector can do it.  I agree with him, at least on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The disconnect and the lack of clear management and timely and effective decision making that has been exposed in the reports we are considering comes as no surprise.  It is replicated at the very top with the Minister and her Government colleagues, and at the highest level in the HSE.  There is clearly no agreed cohesive, cogent approach to all of this.  There are serious differences in the utterances of the Minister, Professor Drumm and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">It was a cancer patient, the late Susie Long, to whom Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred, who most recently and starkly highlighted the injustices of our two-tier health care system.  It is a system that does not provide adequate care for cancer patients.  It is a system where one can get a faster life-saving diagnosis if one is a paying customer.  Public patients like Susie Long have to wait.  In her case, that wait in the second-class queue proved fatal.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Green Party Government is attempting to shirk its responsibility for the chaotic state of our cancer care services.  The mammography issue at Barringtons Hospital in Limerick has exposed the failure of the Government to ensure that private hospitals are properly accountable.  The Health Information and Quality Authority was established in legislation in these Houses in 2006 but was empowered only to monitor services provided by the Health Service Executive.  It does not have powers to hold private hospitals fully accountable.  That is something I and other voices in this House pointed out at the time of the HIQA Bill but the Government ploughed on regardless.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Through the infamous co-location scheme the Government is encouraging the development of more private for-profit hospitals without proper accountability.  When we last addressed cancer care here I recall asking the Green Party Members in Government if they remembered their opposition to co-location.  I am still awaiting their answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I am glad to speak on the cancer reports.  I thank the Minister for coming into the House, as is her duty, because Members often bewail if Ministers do not come into the House to speak on such reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I attempted to listen to the Minister's contribution in my office but my telephone kept ringing.  Did the Minister say that the money allocated to Professor Keane for cancer care will be kept safe from the Health Service Executive?  It will be a separate budget.  It would have to be kept safe from the HSE because if it gets its bumbling — and that is a kind word — hands on it, it will be dissipated with no responsibility.  I hope the cancer care budget remains with Professor Keane and his secretariat under the Minister's guidance and not of the HSE.  The Minister might clarify that matter when replying.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Minister has come into the House to report on the various mishaps, which were major, that happened to women.  It is not just women who speak here today but men also who feel deeply about the women who were misdiagnosed or had to wait their turn in that regard, to quote Deputy Ó Caoláin, because they were second class citizens but we must look forward.  I have found in life that we should always look forward and not be forever looking back.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I very much approve of the centres of excellence outlined by the Minister.  That is the purpose of my speaking here today even though Mullingar, which is in my constituency, had one such good cancer care centre.  The centres of excellence make sense.  That is the reason they should be encouraged.  A previous speaker said they should be located geographically where they are needed.  It is not possible to give the complete level of care, including multidisciplinary teams, that is needed to treat cancer in a comprehensive way.  To think we can have cancer care units anywhere we want them is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I approve of the proposal for centres of excellence.  They are the signpost for the future not just of cancer care but I hope also of heart and stroke care and the care of other prevalent illnesses.  These centres would embody the multidisciplinary teams, research and development, training and the outlook needed to conquer and keep pace with developments in illness.  We will always face illness in our lives and I strongly agree with these centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I take the opportunity to talk about hospice care because while we propose to have centres of excellence there is a need for hospice care throughout the country.  Somebody asked me recently if hospice care was only for people who, sadly, have terminal cancer.  I would have thought hospice care was for those who need it in their dying days or who need palliative care of a certain kind.  The Minister has kindly agreed to meet with a hospice care group from south-west Meath whose members are doing great work on a voluntary basis to set up a hospice for those who come to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">As well as giving my support to the centres of excellence I wish to refer briefly to the issue that has riven this country recently, namely, Nuala O'Faolain's interview on the "Marian Finucane Show" on a Saturday morning.  I am not aware if it was mentioned in this House already but I have not met a man or woman who listened to her speak who was not instantly struck by her searing honesty.  We know her, and I know her in a peripheral way, as I am sure the Minister and others in this House, from meeting her as she went about various assignments here and listening to her broadcasts from the United States where she followed the Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama campaigns.  We know her always as a very forthright person.  I do not believe she spoke in despair but out of a wish to let people know what it is like to be in that dark place and to wish to find an echo with people.  I found her searing honesty tremendous and I applaud it, as I have often applauded statements she has said or written.  Throughout her writing life she has forced us to examine issues in a way we did not know we were capable of doing and that made us face up to issues.  In this way, as she has faced up to her own, she is true to her career and to the way she has managed herself throughout all those years.  She was met with strong, dignified probing by Marian Finucane.  There is no doubt it was a very difficult interview but both women, and I do not wish to sound in any way patronising, should be applauded for the way they conducted themselves.  Ms O'Faolain has given inspiration to all people who suffer from cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">It is interesting to note the way she was told the news in a New York hospital.  She was told by a young functionary going by that she had secondaries all over her.  That was the way the knowledge was imparted to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Her first impulse was to get back to Ireland, which was very telling.  To return home is, I suppose, an animal instinct in everyone who is out of sorts, so she returned to her beloved County Clare.  I understand she is now in a hospice in Galway, or at least that is what we garnered from the interview.  It had an emotional impact throughout the country and it is only proper we should talk about it and face the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Those of us who studied and taught students thought immediately of Dylan Thomas and his poetry:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_322">Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_323">Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_324">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">That is exactly what she is doing and were ever words more appropriate?  She does not want to leave life, but who would?  I would not have regarded her debate as a case for euthanasia, far from it.  She wanted to stay with life.  It clearly shows what people with a terminal illness are going through, as well as the need for properly developed hospice care throughout this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I expect the Minister will make a reply at the end of the debate.  I would be glad if she could respond to the points I have made.  One concerned whether the budget for these centres of excellence would be kept separate from the marauding hands of the HSE.  It could later indicate it does not know where the budget has gone or it has been allocated to some other subhead.  This must be kept with Professor Keane, whom I have not met, for its purpose in setting up the centres of excellence.  He sounds utterly sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">There cannot be a centre of excellence at every crossroads in Ireland.  How could this happen as we would not have the required expertise?  Will the Minister in her reply give some details of plans for hospice care, now and in future?  Will they all work through voluntary effort?  People, both those who raise money and those from whom they expect to raise it, must be worn out sometimes through voluntary effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I am sure in some sections of the Department of Health and Children there are some plans for hospice care, and perhaps various care centres could be placed right throughout the country.  These would of course be centres of excellence, although not in the same vein as what we need for cancer diagnosis and care.  They would rather provide care for the dying with dignity, strength and humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Will the Minister explain if hospices are solely for cancer care, or if anybody with a terminal illness can call upon palliative or hospice care?  I am aware of a wonderful palliative care nurse who came to a home on our road every day where a young woman died recently.  She cared for that woman throughout the night.  I hope to get replies on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I do not share the sentiment of the previous speaker, despite what I say about the HSE.  I have no time for that body, as nobody appears responsible for anything when we call them.  We are passed from Billy to Joe to Jack to Mary, and in the end we do not get a reply.  Answers to parliamentary questions are disgraceful.  I sometimes forget the question by the time I get an answer because the matter has been going on so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I wish for the Minister to stay in her Department because she has guts and competence.  Those two qualities are very necessary for the stewardship of the Department of Health and Children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_339">I was called upon by the Chair in any event.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution, however short, on these important matters.  This is the fourth opportunity we have had since last October to discuss cancer services, particularly in the midlands, and cancer reports.  We can dwell on the past but it is an exercise in futility.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that we must now look forward to see what lessons can and will be learned, and how the learning of these lessons will affect the people of the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The Doherty and O'Doherty reports represent a litany of failures in mammography services in Portlaoise.  These reports outlined the grave and systemic weaknesses that led to nine women from the midlands being erroneously given the all-clear for breast cancer.  I join with other Deputies who wished these women and their families well in their recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It is now some weeks since these reports were published and the hospital community in Portlaoise, and the people of Laois, are still reeling in their aftermath.  Services have been suspended indefinitely and the women of the midlands are being referred to Dublin hospitals, which have neither the capacity nor the resources to cope with the additional demand for services.  At one stage we were told people in the midlands were being transferred to St. Vincent's, on other occasions they were going to St. James's; there appears to be a lack of clarity about which hospitals are providing services to treat the women in the midlands.  There is also the question of transport and arrangement of schedules.  The position is far less than satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">With regard to other cancer services, Portlaoise currently has the longest waiting list for colonoscopies in the entire country.  The people of the midlands are left waiting a full 18 months for a vital routine procedure.  I ask the Minister to address the matter.  In regard to other services at Portlaoise, the maternity unit is grossly understaffed, to the point where health and safety is in jeopardy.  I call on the Minister to direct officers from HIQA to visit the maternity unit in Portlaoise and publish an early report, as there are health and safety issues of a significant degree where women are having children in waiting rooms and conditions far less than satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">A new unit which does not even provide the necessary capacity has been mooted but there has been no progress.  The accident and emergency unit at the hospital is a national disgrace.  A new unit has been provided but remains under lock and key, inaccessible to staff and patients.  The position is of grave concern.  In short, Portlaoise hospital has been exposed as one where a range of factors resulted in a shocking series of misdiagnosis in the past, and now both the hospital and the people of the midlands are being punished.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">It is regrettable that the Minister has not visited Portlaoise hospital since the issue arose last autumn and it is even more regrettable Professor Drumm has not visited the hospital.  I ask both to visit the hospital as a morale-boosting exercise and to at least talk to the staff and people, seeing at first hand the type of service available to the Laois population.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">All units of the hospital remain dangerously underresourced.  Staff morale is at an all-time low and the HSE has done nothing<b> </b>to assure the people of the midlands it has made changes to ensure better services are available.  What has been done to assure people that consultants’ letters to Ministers will not be ignored in the future to the same extent as they were in the past?  What has been done to put the mammography services at the hospital back on track?</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Where is the old equipment featured in the reports and is it still being used for the provision of vital readings?  Has the equipment been replaced and if so, where is the new equipment?  The CT scanner that was under-resourced for such a long period now operates on an nine-to-five basis.  What is the position at weekends?  People are referred to Waterford, Dublin or Tullamore.  These issues should have been addressed in the context of the reports, particularly if confidence in the services is to be restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">What strategic plan, if any, is in place for Portlaoise hospital?  Will it be the whipping boy as regards the closure and downgrading of regional services throughout the country?  Will mammography screening and maternity services be restored?  Will resources be provided in respect of the mammography service?  Will the HSE continue to scale down all aspects of hospital services at Portlaoise?  I want to know what is the plan and the Minister should seek details of it.  The plan is less than certain and the proposals are less than definite and highly unsatisfactory because we simply do not know what is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Neither do we know to where the women and other people of the midlands are to go under the new regime of regional centres.  I do not have a difficulty, in principle, with regional centres for cancer care, notwithstanding the fact that it is not proposed to situate such a centre in the midlands.  I have no problem with that provided the people of my constituency and beyond are given assurances that they will have access to the type of vital treatment services which they deserve and which are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Health Service Executive and the Minister for Health and Children have conspired to create an information vacuum in respect of what is happening, particularly in the context of the hundreds of thousands of people in the midlands who are going to lose their services.  Parliamentary questions tabled by Deputies remain unanswered.  I recently experienced a farcical situation where I left a meeting in Tullamore stating that I would be obliged to progress a particular matter by way of parliamentary question and where said question was referred by the Minister's office to that of Professor Drumm and, in turn, sent back to the gentleman with whom I had originally been dealing.  The latter was asked to reply but indicated that because the matter involved funding it was not proper to him and he had no information in respect of it.  What I experienced was a complete affront to the entire democratic process.  Neither the Minister, the HSE nor the hospital appear to be accountable to the people or their public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Some time ago I called on the HSE — I do so again today — to introduce a structured schedule of public meetings to be attended by senior hospital personnel in the midlands.  Such meetings are essential if public confidence in the hospital services available to the people of the region is to be restored.  Service providers and hospitals must be able, at all times, to institute clear lines of communication with their patients and prospective patients.  Patients and their families offer a very valuable resource to hospital managers who wish to improve their standard to care and address deficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I am suggesting that the general manager, medical director and director of nursing of each hospital in the region should be prepared to meet elected representatives and members of the public on a regular basis.  They should be prepared to discuss their hospitals and the plans they have for them, put their service plans in the public domain and talk to the local media.  Information is vital and the restoration of the confidence of the people of Portlaoise and the midlands is an essential task which, regrettably, has been ignored since the publication of these reports six weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Nothing less than a schedule of public meetings will be appropriate, particularly if the hospital in Portlaoise is to have a vibrant future.  Despite the fact that they are currently being treated as such by the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, people in Laois-Offaly and the wider midlands region are not second-class citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The Minister likes to refer to the powers she does not possess.  As a result, I sometimes wonder about the Department of Health and Children and the role and function of the Minister.  She has powers to ensure that the lines of communication between the people of the midlands and the hospital in Portlaoise are opened and kept that way.  The current situation is a complete farce.  People are rightly frustrated, fearful and angry.  They believe they deserve better from the Minister and the HSE and they are right to do so.  They want answers and they want to know that lessons will be learned and an action plan put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The consequences of the Doherty and O'Doherty reports cannot be that Portlaoise hospital is condemned to limbo on an indefinite basis.  It needs a strategic plan and a schedule of structured funding.  People must be informed as to what is happening, which is the least they deserve.  The Minister must provide leadership in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue, which is vital to me, my constituents and people throughout the country.  I met Professor Tom Keane who came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children and what he said made me confident that he can deliver the required changes.  I spoke on previous occasions in support of the national cancer strategy.  I am of the view, now more than ever, that said strategy will be delivered upon by the Minister and Professor Keane.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We need to focus on survival rates among cancer patients.  It has been proven that these rates are 20% higher where patients are treated at centres of excellence.  Such centres are key to improving survival rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">There is no doubt that reform of the health service will be difficult.  All the more reason then that we should drive such reform and change.  By definition, reform means change.  Reform alters people's boundaries and takes them out of their comfort zones.  It also leads to people seeing themselves as winners or losers in some sort of battle.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Each hospital forms part of a jigsaw.  The Government is obliged to consider the whole as opposed to merely focusing on individual pieces.  The ultimate goal as regards reform of the health service is the improvement of standards of patient care, an increase in survival rates and the provision of the most up-to-date treatments.  We have started out on that road.  Our journey will be long and difficult but, ultimately, it will be effective and results will be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Early diagnosis is the key to delivering improved survival rates.  When early diagnosis becomes the norm, multidisciplinary teams must be in place to deal with the large throughput of cancer-related illnesses.  Doctors must be familiar with the broad range of cancer treatments and the side effects thereof.  They must not work in isolation from others involved in the care of individual patients.  Everyone dealing with a particular patient must work together and communicate with each other.  It should not be the case that medical teams treat different parts of illnesses in isolation.  Patients will suffer unless an approach that is all-encompassing is taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Hospitals will lose services as the latter are transferred elsewhere.  However, we must ensure the needs of cancer patients remain to the fore.  In my constituency of Dublin South-East there have been proposals for a transfer of services from St. Luke's to St. James's.  St. Luke's is a wonderful facility with excellent staff and the environment is positive for anyone who is ill and recovering from cancer.  If we are required to transfer services to St. James's to improve matters and if more people will survive as a result of such a transfer, we must go ahead with the move.  The transferral of services to St. James's will allow St. Luke's to develop other services on the existing site, which is clearly in the interests of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Deputy Charles Flanagan said that we must learn lessons, but the establishment of HIQA and the appointment of Professor Keane are examples of learning from past mistakes.  The recent Barringtons and O'Malley reports were distressing.  I also extend my sympathy and support to those involved in their recovery.  These reports have highlighted the real need to bring about change by establishing these centres of excellence as soon as we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I wish we were debating a motion because then we could vote on it.  Fine Gael Deputies decided that we would no longer have debates such as this, but motions on which we can vote.  I am surprised that we are having statements again today because we cannot have a vote when they conclude.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">As somebody who comes from a family whose sister died at 45 years of age, and a sister last week had her breast removed, I know all about the cancer services that are available.  The services in County Mayo are excellent and there is an excellent team working there.  Mayo General Hospital is seeking a managed clinical cancer treatment network to connect with Galway.  We have an excellent team of surgeons in Castlebar.  However, there was an announcement recently by the hospital manager, although not with the good wishes of the consultants or the people of Mayo, that services would be moved from Mayo General Hospital to Galway.  This battle is not over.  It is easy for the Minister, Deputy Harney, Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Chris Andrews to speak when four centres of excellence will be located in Dublin.  We will have one in Galway but there will be none in Mayo, Sligo or Donegal, and that is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">It is fine for Professor Keane, great man that he is, and everybody says he is, but the same professor is getting €600,000 for a two-year contract.  Professor Keane will be like the Minister, he will walk away after two years, whether the system works.  He will be like the Minister, saying that he has no responsibility for the HSE.  He will have no responsibility for what is left behind him.  He has taken away an excellent service from Mayo.  Last year, 79 women were operated on.  Some 10,000 people came on to the streets of Castlebar to state that they were happy with the service there.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">We do not trust the Minister, the HSE or Brendan Drumm because they cannot deliver services.  They have made a mess of the HSE.  They will make the country's cancer services worse rather than better.  People living in Blacksod or Belmullet are 100 miles away from Galway city, which means they must make a 200 mile round trip for an appointment.  There are no parking facilities because the hospital is overcrowded.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I will give an example of how they are operating in Galway already.  A gentleman wrote to me and to the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> in Castlebar.  The newspaper contacted the HSE and I tabled a parliamentary question.  The HSE responded to the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> but I am still waiting for my reply.  It informed a woman that she would have an appointment for oncology services on 23 September 2008, but the problem is that the woman has been dead for 17 years.  The HSE went on to say it regretted sending out the appointment letter and blamed a junior member of staff.  A senior member of staff should have taken responsibility for that, however.  It is outrageous that the HSE does not have its records up to date.  It is also outrageous that the HSE expects people in Mayo and Sligo to have confidence in that hospital.  How can one have confidence in a hospital that gave an appointment to a woman who has been dead for 17 years?  I have no confidence in that hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I oppose the withdrawal of services from Mayo General Hospital, which we are happy with and want to keep.  That battle is not over yet.  Deputies Beverley Flynn and Dara Calleary, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, and other Government Deputies will soon have an opportunity to vote in this House on cancer services for the north west.  I am sick and tired of such people speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  In Mayo they are all for it, while in Dublin they are all for the Minister, but they will have to make a decision here shortly.  When we put that motion on the floor of the House we will see if they vote for the people of Donegal, Sligo and Mayo, but they will not be speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  We will bring the women from Sligo and Mayo to the Visitors Gallery to show them what these politicians are made of.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">We are proud of our cancer services in Mayo, including the team of consultants there.  The women of the county want them so why should a service be taken away, at least until the service in Galway is up and running?  People should be allowed to decide for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Recently, I came across the case of a woman who went into a private hospital to have her breast removed.  She has private health insurance.  She should have been receiving chemotherapy for the past five weeks but is not fit to because she got an infection in that hospital.  That is the kind of health service we have in this country, yet we are told there have never been as many financial resources as at present.  We are told that this is the way forward, but is that not what the Minister told us about the HSE?  She said there were too many health boards with too many people on them and they were not working.  She said the HSE would be the answer to everything but it has destroyed the health service.  We have never had so many problems and nobody is taking responsibility for anything.  In the past two or three years, we have been paying more money for consultants and less money for doctors, nurses and attendants.  Something is wrong.  Ireland is only a small country with a population of 4.5 million.  There are as many people in Manchester, yet their health services are able to cope while ours cannot.   What has gone wrong with the health service here?</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Yesterday, a man in Mayo General Hospital was waiting to be called today for a bed in Galway, but no such bed is available.  A young man in Erris with a serious head problem has been waiting four weeks for a bed in Beaumont Hospital.  His mother and sister contact me every day looking for the best service for their loved one, but it is not forthcoming.  What is going wrong?</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Government talks about decentralisation to bring services from Dublin to the regions, but the opposite is being done with the health service.  Services are being transferred from rural areas to the cities.  That is not acceptable and something must be done about it.  I plead with the Minister to leave the services we have in Mayo General Hospital, including the excellent staff, Kevin Barry, Mary Casey and Ronan Waldron.  These are excellent consultants and surgeons.  I will support the Minister if she wishes to set up centres of excellence.  The women of Mayo, Sligo and Galway will make a decision and go to the best places.  I plead with the Minister to leave the services in place for the women of Mayo and to have a satellite service between Mayo and Galway.  The Minister should not take away a service that is working from a county that needs it.  Ours is a rural, disadvantaged area and circumstances are very difficult for people living there.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">People in my constituency cannot get hospital appointments because the HSE has no funding to bring them to the hospital.  People will die because they cannot get to appointments and the Minister wants to remove services from Mayo.  It is not right and it should not happen.  The services are working but what the Minister tried with the HSE is not working.  I say to Professor Keane that he is entitled to his €600,000 but he is not doing any favours to the women of Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">However, Deputy Ring's comments on Professor Keane are unfortunate.  We have procured the services of Professor Keane and other services from the British Columbia Cancer Centre for a two-year period and the sum of money is €600,000.  That is not the salary of Professor Keane.  Most surgeons working in this city earn substantially more than that in one year.  This man is incredible value for money, though I hate using the term.  We are very fortunate to have someone of his competence, experience and expertise to implement the cancer control programme.  Everyone who has met him, including clinicians, nurses, managers and administrators are deeply impressed with the speed with which he sought to implement the cancer control plan.  He came here last November and he tells me that, in respect of breast cancer, he is ahead of schedule, which is very reassuring.  He is working with clinicians around the country to get clinical buy-in.  Just a few weeks ago he addressed 200 surgeons at the Royal College of Surgeons.  He left the room with everyone agreeing that his methodology and his plan was the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Regarding Mayo, the clinicians support Professor Keane, particularly Dr. Barry, the breast surgeon there.  I have publicly saluted Dr. Barry's courage.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">I welcome the fact that the service is being rolled out to Mayo.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the complete roll-out.  That will take place by the end of next year in respect of BreastCheck.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Cervical screening will be rolled out to the entire population base this summer.  It will not be done in the same manner as BreastCheck, county by county.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The outsourcing of cytology is done for two reasons.  One is quality, because it will take at least two years to bring our facilities to the standard required.  The second reason is cost, but it is mainly a quality issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Before I address the points raised about cancer, on the broader issues of health, between 1999 and 2003 life expectancy in Ireland increased by three years, the fastest increase in the developed world.  That happened because of better treatments.  Today, a child born in Ireland will live longer than a child born in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.  Fewer than half the number of people who used to die from heart disease die from it today.  This is one of the biggest success stories that has dramatically impacted on life expectancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The OECD reviewed cancer performance here in 1994-98 and 1999-2003.  Comparing the second period with the first, the survival outcomes had improved by 31% for pancreatic cancer, 24% for prostate cancer, 13% for lung cancer, 10% for leukaemia and 9% for breast cancer, which was one of the best performances.  We are top of the class on children's cancer, ahead of the European average.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I say these things because we hear constant references to shambles and disaster.  Some 400,000 more people are treated in our hospitals this year than was the case 12 years ago, as day cases, outpatients or in-hospital treatments.  For the top 20 procedures, instead of people waiting two to five years, as was the case some years ago, it is an average of two to fivemonths.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Regarding cancer services, we know that volume equals quality.  Some 250 publications state that if one is not treated in a centre with a high volume of cases on an annual basis — a minimum of 150 — the chances of surviving are diminished by 20%.  That means that one in five women, who would otherwise survive, would die.  This is compelling evidence and if we are interested in patient safety we are compelled to implement that.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Deputy Ring referred to 79 cases, which falls far short of 150.  When BreastCheck is rolled out and that is integrated into the hospital in Galway, the new cases in Mayo will be substantially reduced.  The same applies to other counties.  We have made an exception for Donegal, for geographic reasons and because of dialogue and discussion we are having with the authorities in Northern Ireland on cancer care.  There will be a satellite centre from Galway in the hospital in Letterkenny and, hopefully, there will be radiation and oncology facilities.  The Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland announced last week that radiation oncology services are being rolled out to Altnagelvin.  I have discussed with the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey, our interest in jointly providing radiation oncology for the patients in the region.  The Irish Government will be prepared to fund capital investment or procure services and the Minister there is very interested in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">One of the first people I met when I became Minister for Health and Children was Margaret Murphy from Cork.  I met her in the UK at a World Health Organisation, WHO, patient safety conference.  Her son, Kevin, died long before I became Minister from errors in a hospital in this country.  She wanted to find out what happened to her son and why, but no one gave her answers.  She litigated and when she received compensation she donated it to a charity.  That era is over.  If mistakes occur we will investigate them, painful as it is, publish the findings and learn from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Deputy Shatter referred to blame culture.  I have learnt from domestic expertise and international conferences I attended under the auspices of the World Health Organisation that if there is a blame culture, a doctor or nurse will not put up his or her hands if they think they will be penalised.  That is what happens in patient safety cases.  The countries that do best are those that encourage reporting the error to ensure the mistake does not happen again or that the capacity for the mistake can be minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I do not have time to respond to all the issues raised by Deputies.  The health reform programme is in its infancy.  The previous organisation of services did not work, which is why we have a new regime.  The new regime is in its infancy and is slower than I or Professor Drumm would wish, but progress is being made.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to my HSE, but it is my HIQA too, if she wishes to be personal.  This House passed the legislation and it had the support of all the parties on the establishment of a unified system.</p>

There is an onus on all of us, particularly people who work in the public sector, to support the developments.  One never hears somebody from a private hospital moaning about it and running it down.

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_401">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I am pleased to introduce the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill for the consideration of this House.  Although it is a relatively short Bill, its provisions underpin several crucial elements of the Government's energy policy and it is a key constituent of the Government's priority legislative programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">This Bill provides for an enhanced role for EirGrid, as a strong independent State company, and underpins the development of electricity interconnection generally.  The early enactment of this Bill will also facilitate the delivery to schedule of the east-west electricity interconnector.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I would like to speak first about the expanded role for EirGrid in relation to interconnectors.  EirGrid plc is the fully independent transmission system operator licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  Since it took over as the licensed operator of the electricity transmission system in 2006, EirGrid has rapidly developed into a dynamic new player in the Irish electricity market.  This Bill is the first step in expanding the functions of EirGrid, in line with the Government's energy policy framework and An Agreed Programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">EirGrid's current statutory functions as transmission system operator include the operation, planning and development of the Irish electricity transmission system; the independent operation of the single electricity market in co-operation with EirGrid's Northern Ireland equivalent, SONI; and the critical task of monitoring and reporting on security of electricity supply and generation adequacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">EirGrid's statutory remit also provides for it to develop opportunities for interconnection of the Irish transmission system with other systems, in all cases with a view to ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity are met and having due regard for the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">This Bill expands the statutory functions of EirGrid in relation to interconnection.  It provides that EirGrid may construct, own and operate an interconnector subject to the grant of the appropriate licence and authorisation by the regulator.  EirGrid plc was established by the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000, or SI 445 of 2000.  On the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, this Bill restates certain provisions of these regulations in primary legislation in order to provide the strongest possible underpinning for EirGrid's new role.  The corresponding provisions in SI 445 will be revoked to avoid duplication.  The provisions which are being restated in primary legislation relate to subsidiaries of EirGrid and borrowings and capital expenditure by EirGrid.  These provisions are restated in slightly amended form and include an increase in EirGrid's borrowing limit to a total of €750 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The increased borrowing limit provides EirGrid with the financial leverage and scope to develop its expanded role and advance a challenging agenda.  The issues of climate change and energy security are urgent and imperative priorities for Ireland, the EU and all governments worldwide.  The achievement of the ambitious targets we have set for emissions reduction, renewables and energy efficiency improvement present key challenges for the electricity sector.  At the same time, this sector has recently entered a new era with the establishment of the all-island single electricity market.  At this time of unprecedented change, EirGrid has an increasingly important strategic role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I look forward to the publication shortly of EirGrid's transmission development strategy 2025, which will be crucial in identifying how we can support the increasing penetration of renewable energy generation and address the technical challenges in terms of the development and operation of the electricity transmission system.  It will underpin our continued economic, social and regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I have recently announced an independent study on the transfer of the electricity transmission assets.  I expect that EirGrid, as a key State stakeholder, will provide an important input into this analysis.  As regards interconnection, EirGrid is currently progressing the development of the second North-South interconnector in co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities.  The publicly expressed concerns in regards to this and other essential transmission system developments, serve to underline the complexity of the task facing EirGrid in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">In this context, my Department has commissioned a study to provide the best available independent professional advice on the relative merits of constructing and operating overhead transmission lines as compared with underground cables.  The study will focus on technical characteristics, reliability, operation and maintenance factors, environmental impact, possible health issues and cost of both types of electricity infrastructure.  In anticipation of the enactment of this Bill, EirGrid is also currently advancing the development of the east-west electricity interconnector.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Government attaches the highest priority to this project, which will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness as well as providing increased potential for the export of wind-generated electricity.  I will expand on a few of the potential benefits to Ireland from interconnection with the UK market.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The generation adequacy report is produced annually by EirGrid and sets out the forecasts for both the supply and demand for electricity over a seven year period. The most recent report has identified a need for additional generating capacity over the next seven years to maintain security of electricity supply.  East-west interconnection will afford Ireland direct and secure access to the British energy market where, I am advised, there is significant generation capacity available to enhance security of supply on this island.  In addition, Britain is also developing interconnectors with mainland Europe to further contribute to security of supply and market integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The east-west interconnector will also enhance the competitive environment in the Irish electricity market by allowing third party access in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.  This, together with the all-island single electricity market, should over time exert downward pressure on electricity prices.  A significant percentage of Ireland's electricity needs are generated from gas — some 50% overall.  In terms of fuel diversity, the introduction of the east-west interconnector to Ireland will be a major benefit by providing an external source of electricity which will reduce our dependency on gas-powered generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The east-west interconnector will help support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly non-dispatchable wind generation in the Irish market.  Reserve supply is required to provide back-up for wind generation at times when the wind is not blowing.  The east-west interconnector will provide the capacity and stability that is required and will increase the extent to which renewable generation can be accommodated on the transmission system.  It will also offer potential opportunities for export of Irish wind generated electricity.  Surplus power can be shared with Britain in times of high wind generation.  In times of low wind generation power can be imported from Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We have set ourselves ambitious targets of progressively achieving 33% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020, with 15% the target for 2010.  The recently published all-island grid study shows the possibility of up to 42% of electricity being provided from renewable generation by 2020.  This study identifies the east-west interconnector as a key enabler for delivering our ambitious national and EU renewables targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">It is for these reasons that the Government has attached such a high priority to the delivery of the east-west interconnector.  On foot of a Government decision in 2006 the Commission for Energy Regulation was requested to arrange the design of a competition to secure the construction of a 500 MW interconnector at the earliest possible date before 2012.  The Government also decided that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">To oversee and ensure completion to schedule, a high-level co-ordination group has been established under the chairmanship of the CER and comprising representatives of EirGrid and my Department.  I am advised that work on the project is progressing well.  In recent weeks EirGrid, overseen by the CER, launched a competition for the design and construction of the interconnector.  I am also advised that the contract for design and construction will be completed by the end of September this year, when the successful bidder will be announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">EirGrid is advancing work on route selection, planning and foreshore permissions and technical specification of the interconnector.  It has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system.  It has also obtained a formal connection offer from the UK national grid for a site at Deeside in Wales, which it has accepted.  EirGrid has begun work on a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.  When this survey is completed, the final route to link the two connection points will be determined.  It is, therefore, very timely that this Bill is brought forward for consideration by the Oireachtas.  It provides a clear signal of the Government's support for the project.  This Bill has been identified as a priority item in the Government's legislation programme and I trust I can count on the support of the Members of this House for its provisions and smooth passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Bill will provide EirGrid with the legislative underpinning to advance to the next stage of the east-west interconnector project and ensure there are no delays.  I am advised that the end of September 2011 is targeted for the completion of works, with the end of March 2012 targeted for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">In addition to providing for EirGrid's role regarding interconnection, the Bill also provides generally for future interconnection.  The Bill makes some minor amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, to which I will refer as the 1999 Act.  The Bill inserts a new subsection in the 1999 Act to provide that a person operating an interconnector without the appropriate licence will be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or term of imprisonment.  This ensures consistency with offence provisions for other licensable activities.  For example, it is already an offence to supply or generate electricity without the appropriate licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Bill provides further clarification of the position of interconnectors with respect to the transmission system.  Section 2A of the 1999 Act provides that the cost of interconnectors would be recovered through transmission system charges.  This Bill provides that those costs are only to be recovered in the case of a regulated interconnector, such as the east-west interconnector, or where the CER determines that it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The new provision facilitates the development of merchant interconnectors, which are privately funded and developed.  Merchant interconnection projects are financed through charges for the use of the interconnector, rather than being compensated through transmission system charges.  These new provisions are in line with the EU regulations in respect of merchant and regulated interconnectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Greater interconnection between member states is a key priority for the European Union to ensure the effective operation of the internal energy market.  The importance of the east-west interconnector project has been formally recognised at European level and it has been designated a "project of European interest", which is the category of projects with the highest priority at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The east-west interconnector is included in the EU trans-European networks priority interconnection plan.  The priority interconnection plan proposes specific measures for the progressive completion of critical energy infrastructure projects.  As a tangible measure of support, funding totalling some €2.5 million is being made available under the EU trans-European networks programme to advance the study phases of the east-west interconnector project.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">As a peripheral island nation, Ireland strongly supports the progressive development of European regional electricity markets underpinned by greater interconnection.  This work is a natural progression from the development, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities, of the all-island energy market and the launch of the single electricity market, SEM, in November of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">My Department, the CER and EirGrid, along with their UK and French counterparts, are actively working towards the development of a regional electricity market as part of the EU Commission's initiative to develop regional energy markets.  This initiative will be underpinned by greater interconnection.  The current focus is on the delivery of the second North-South electricity interconnector and the new east-west electricity interconnector no later than 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">At the Government's request, EirGrid will undertake cost-benefit analysis and feasibility planning for further interconnection with the United Kingdom and potentially with the rest of Europe in the longer term.  This analysis will take account of any proposals to develop interconnection on a merchant basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Bill is an important measure in the delivery of the Government's energy policy.  I therefore look forward to listening carefully to the views of Members of the House and their assistance in passing it into law.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_432">That is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Fine Gael will not be opposing this Bill and it welcomes its introduction for the very straightforward reason that it believes the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Britain needs to be built as soon as possible.  EirGrid is the obvious body to manage this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In essence, the legislation is necessary to ensure there will be no further delays regarding this project, which should be completed by now.  It has taken too long.  The delay is not EirGrid's fault.  Approximately eight years ago, the then Minister announced that he supported the concept of an east-west interconnector and that he would invite private sector interests to build it.  Over a long period, the State has come to recognise that the private sector did not have either the capacity or interest to complete the project in a manner with which the State would be comfortable.  EirGrid is now managing the project and this is positive.  My experience of the organisation is that it is highly competent and efficient, although I am somewhat critical of its PR activities in respect of the so-called North-South interconnector and the debate on whether the infrastructure should be underground or over ground.  However, this is not related to its ability to get a job done.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">As has been stated, the aim of this Bill is, first and foremost, to expand the functions of EirGrid to include construction of an interconnector and the ownership and operation thereof, subject to authorisation by the CER.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Bill will amend the current Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to clarify the position of interconnectors not owned by the ESB.  It will also make it an offence to operate an interconnector without appropriate authorisation by the CER.  Additional appropriate powers are being given to the CER in recognition of the fact that, for the first time, a major section of grid infrastructure is being constructed that will not be owned by the ESB or be on the ESB's balance sheet.  This is a major departure in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Bill will provide for the establishment of subsidiaries by EirGrid to increase its statutory borrowing capacity, which is obviously necessary to raise funds for the project in question, and to provide for capital expenditure by EirGrid.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We are facilitating the transition of  EirGrid from a management company for an ESB-owned asset to a State company in its own right tasked with managing an asset on behalf of the State that it is to construct and own.  Some policy issues arise from this strategic decision.  In this regard, we must consider the Government's attitude to and policy on the separation of assets within the ESB and whether it plans to proceed with taking the rest of the grid out of ESB ownership and putting it into the ownership of EirGrid.  I remain to be convinced but I believe doing so would make sense, particularly in the context of owning interconnectors.  It makes sense in principle for an interconnector to be an extension of the existing grid, which will essentially plug the Irish grid into the British grid and allow a flow in both directions such that power can be purchased or sold, as deemed appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Strategic issues arise when we accept the principle that ownership of the interconnector is separate from ownership of the grid.  There is private interest in building two further east-west interconnectors.  Having the ownership of the interconnector between the Irish and British grid in private ownership has potential knock-on effects on security of supply as we would have a private operator who is in it for profit essentially controlling the supply of power coming to and going from the Irish grid.  There are some regulatory issues in that regard that need to be explored further.  Having said that I am in favour of more interconnection through either the private or public sector.  Given the choice my preference would be that the grid in Ireland should be owned and managed by the same body that owns and manages interconnection so that essentially our grid is expanding and plugging into other grids, initially in Britain and hopefully at some stage in the future places like France also.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I wish to talk about the importance if interconnection on three levels, the first of which is security of supply.  The present energy discussion is dominated by price and environmental concerns.  Security of supply is perhaps more important than those issues.  Ireland is in a very vulnerable position should the supply of fuel such as coal, gas and oil dry up or become too expensive.  Ireland's energy import dependency is 91%.  When this is compared with the UK at just 66% one begins to realise how exposed we are to price fluctuations on world markets or simply a cut-off of supply when only 9% of our fuel is indigenous to Ireland through peat, gas or renewable sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Other countries have found solutions to this issue.  Most of them have turned to nuclear power generation, for example, to try to reduce their dependency on imported fuel.  I do not believe that is an option for Ireland at the moment and I hope it will not be an option in the future.  However, obviously we cannot shut our minds entirely to the option as technology advances and as issues relating to nuclear power develop.  At the moment the public do not want us to move in that direction and rather want to see an ambitious leadership role being taken by Government and in particular the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to roll out renewable energy projects across the country, which is being facilitated by grid studies, grid preparation etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The effect of an interconnector on Ireland's security of supply is to give more capacity to plug into other electricity grids thereby making us less reliant on our existing sources of fossil fuels.  Not only will we have a backup but we will also have a viable alternative to importing large amounts of fuel.  In other words we will be able to import energy directly on the grid as opposed to needing to generate everything here ourselves.  We had a market in the Republic of Ireland which developed into an all-island market with some interconnection to Great Britain through Northern Ireland and are now hopefully creating an electricity grid for Ireland and Britain.  If we continue to ramp up our interconnection capacity between the two islands, at some stage in the future we could get to what the Minister refers to as regional grid infrastructure whereby the north west of Europe could at some stage develop into a north-west European grid, if one wants to call it that.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">That has happened in other countries, for example with the interconnection between Scandinavian countries which is far more ambitious than what we are achieving here.  That is necessary as it is recognised across the European Union that our standard sources of fuel for energy are running out.  They are certainly running out in the areas from which we have been used to getting a supply.  It would be safe to say that within ten years gas supply available for export from European countries will simply run out.  The European Union needs to prepare itself for a time when we will be importing all of our gas from Russia, Kazakhstan, the Middle East and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The Lisbon reform treaty makes it clear that the European Union is preparing itself for that eventuality.  For Ireland's sake I hope we will be able to negotiate collectively as a Union on issues such as gas supply in particular because of the gas line infrastructure across the European Union.  Otherwise we will see companies like Gazprom being able to flex huge political muscle with countries in the European Union.  In that scenario a small country like Ireland would not have the influence it needs to get a good deal on affordable gas for Ireland.  Given our reliance on the importation of gas we are very vulnerable to that kind of scenario which is why I encourage the Minister to review gas storage issues, including LPG storage.  He should consider existing resources such as empty gas fields that could potentially be used to store gas purely for security of supply reasons.  From speaking to representatives of Bord Gáis I understand that if our gas supply coming from abroad, which is nearly all of it — some still comes from the Kinsale gas field, were to be cut off we would have approximately four days of supply.  That is a very vulnerable position and needs to be addressed even if it costs the State some money to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I have made my point about energy security and the need for us to be part of a much wider grid, which would put us in a much stronger position.  The next area relates to price competitiveness for energy.  I held this portfolio approximately six years ago.  Prior to me being given this brief Ireland had been struggling to open our energy generation business to competition.  We have had some limited success in this regard in terms of increased efficiency, increased customer choice and a reduction in prices.  Interconnection will automatically open up the possibility of importing energy to provide competition for energy generators in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The cost of electricity in the UK over the past five years has consistently been between 8% and 15% cheaper, depending when the measurement was made, than in Ireland.  As long as interconnection comes at an affordable price, it makes sense for us to import excess energy from the UK grid to Ireland, when appropriate.  If nothing else, this will introduce competition to the Irish electricity market and may help drive down prices and increase choice and services for businesses and households.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I will put the situation starkly.  A business that seeks to set up in an English speaking country in the European Union will consider Ireland and Britain.  The latest figures show that the cost per 100 KW hours is €11.50 in Dublin and €9.50 in Manchester.  The difference between the two is 18%.  My figures are from 2007; there may be more recent figures that are different due to exchange rates but changes due to exchange rates do not reflect anything proactive that we have done.  Prices in Ireland and Britain should be levelled out; this is already happening in the all-island market but I hope it goes further if we continue to build interconnection capacity from an east-west perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Regarding environmental sustainability and renewable energy, when many people speak of Ireland's capacity to produce renewable energy they often limit their vision of what can be achieved on the basis of our energy needs on this island.  The Republic of Ireland's total usage of power comes to between 5,000 and 6,000 MW.  People make calculations loosely, based on the percentage of the market that can be provided by renewable sources such as wind power, wave power, tidal energy, biomass, bioenergy, bio-fuels and so on.  We should not limit our thinking in this way and, to be fair to the Minister, he does not do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The electricity grid study the Minister launched some months ago presented different portfolios for Ireland's energy mix.  The most ambitious one is portfolio 6, which has 8,000 MW coming from wind energy, but it is automatically dismissed as not achievable.  Portfolio 5, the next most ambitious, has about 6,000 MW potentially coming from wind energy and this is what we are aiming for.  This indicates what the Irish grid can manage in terms of wind power coming onto the grid in an intermittent way, without substantial storage capacity, which would allow it to be held and used at peak power times, and without substantial interconnection capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">If we look at this in a more ambitious way we could say that Ireland should not be limited in terms of how much energy it can produce from renewable sources.  Instead we should see this area as one in which Ireland has a natural competitive advantage because of average and net wind speeds here and wave and tidal resources.  Ireland should be a green fuel source for other parts of Europe and the only way this can be achieved is through ambitious interconnection projects.  That is why I encourage the Minister and EirGrid to get this job done as quickly as possible.  He should also encourage the private sector interconnection projects that have been proposed to proceed as soon as possible.  The Minister could also examine the possibility of direct interconnection with countries like France, rather than rely on going through the British grid to access the mainland European grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">It is true that, in terms of EirGrid's management, many megawatts coming onto the grid from wind sources present something of a nightmare scenario.  Wind turbines provide power approximately 35% of the time in Ireland and approximately 30% of the time in most other places in Europe, sometimes even less.  Often power provided by a wind turbine is not needed because it comes at 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. when there is already plenty of capacity on the grid.  From an Irish perspective wind power is the most advanced source of renewable energy but the problem is that it is also the most inconsistent.  Consistency could be provided by the kind of massive scale Eddie O'Connor refers to when he speaks of an offshore European wind-powered electricity grid, which, in my view, represents magnificent thinking in terms of ambition; the number crunchers will tell us whether it is viable.  It is our job to be ambitious, be ideas people and try to find solutions to an energy crisis that is looming globally, in Europe and in Ireland.  From this point of view we must be ambitious in the areas we know can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">In terms of the Irish marketplace and the Irish grid, the only way we can build wind projects on the scale proposed and in the pipeline is to invest more significantly in finding solutions to energy storage.  We must be able to capture the energy that comes from a wind turbine at 3 a.m. and store it through the use of hydrogen or batteries.  We could even pump water uphill so that it can flow down during peak periods, as is done at Turlough Hill.  We must find effective methods of storage and examine large-scale storage projects that can be linked to the kind of wind energy ambition that now exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I have a significant concern and this is as appropriate time as ever to mention it to the Minister.  Under the Gate 3 process of giving grid connections to wind energy projects less than 2,000 MW will be given out and this applies to quite a lot of projects.  However, some 8,500 MW of wind projects seek connection through Gate 3.  More than 6,500 MW of wind projects are in the pipeline.  Some of these projects are onshore and others offshore, comprising farmers, consortia and large businesses, all of which have heavily invested in securing planning permissions and consultants to examine costings of construction and connection to the grid.  In the current scenario, they have no chance of getting a grid connection until 2020.  Even if we reach the Minister's target, seen by many as ambitious, of 4,000 MW to 5,000 MW wind-energy generation by 2020, there are still these projects across the country which will never get a grid connection.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">What does one say to a consortium, excited about the possibilities of wind-energy production, which has spent €300,000 on planning permission and consultants' reports on construction and grid connection when one knows with the Gate 3 phase they do not have a chance?</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_455">On a point of information, I do not believe 8,000 groups have planning permission.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_456">Yes, the Minister is correct about that but there are substantially more groups with planning permission than can be granted connection.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">This problem will get worse.  Most in the industry believe the Minister has given a general price support allocation for offshore wind farms which will result in large scale farms being proposed.  In the overall context of the Minister's target of 4,000 MW to 5,000 MW generation by 2020 from wind energy, most of that potentially could come from offshore sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Fine Gael strongly supports the need for energy storage and interconnection so that Ireland can become the green-eyed Arabs of Europe.  This phrase was coined by a Norwegian expert who described herself as coming from the blue-eyed Arabs of Europe.  The same expert recently explained to me that when Norway first discovered offshore oil 40 years ago, exploiting it was initially dismissed as too expensive due to restrictions in drilling technology.  Now, the successful exploitation of its offshore natural resources is seen as the country's greatest progressive thinking.  She claims Ireland is not thinking ambitiously in exploiting its wind resources.  We need to take notice of this and examine the facts and figures as to what is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Interconnection is a good idea but are we ambitious enough with it?  The North-South interconnector has a 400 MW capacity while the proposed east-west one will have a 500 MW capacity.  Norway has a 2,800 MW interconnector between it and Sweden; a 1,000 MW one with Denmark; a 100 MW one with Finland and a smaller one with Russia.  It is building a 580 km, 700 MW interconnector with the Netherlands.  That is a total of 4,650 MW of interconnector capacity coming in and out of Norway.  If Ireland is going to be ambitious about renewable energy and complete the Minister's vision in what can be achieved in the next 20 years, interconnection must play a far larger role than we are envisaging.  EirGrid will be central to that planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">We must also ensure the next proposed interconnector does not take eight years to complete from initial planning to final construction.  The private sector company building the interconnector between the Netherlands and Norway, almost 600 km long, can do it in three years.  I accept complexities arise with connections, construction, seabed surveys and planning permission.  Those problems, however, exist elsewhere and they manage to get over them.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The North-South interconnector is a misnomer as it is part of an all-island grid linking Northern Ireland with the Republic.  A classic interconnector is a DC line that electricity can be taken from and put into on an end-to-end basis.  The proposed North-South interconnector through counties Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and into Northern Ireland will be a 400 kV AC line.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I give credit to North East Pylon Pressure which has undertaken major studies to make the case to the Minister, the Government and Opposition that technology allows this infrastructure to be placed underground.  I welcome the Minister's appointment of an independent consultant to examine this claim.  It will have large implications on future grid development projects which will be important to facilitate the renewable energy projects we are promoting.  Renewable energy cannot work without an adequate grid to facilitate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">A cost analysis of using overhead cable for the proposed North-South interconnector may show it would be cheaper than putting it underground.  However, if the public relations exercise with people living in the affected areas in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan is not managed effectively, objections and obstruction to it could mean construction could take up to six years with rising costs.  In that case, the final analysis might show it may well be cheaper to put the infrastructure underground in the first place.  The Minister needs to take this type of thinking into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I will return to other issues such as ownership of the grid on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">Listening to Deputy Coveney comparing infrastructure construction times in this country and others, I was reminded that the stretch of road between Bray and Greystones in Wicklow took nearly as long to build as the road bridge between Denmark and Sweden.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">This enabling Bill is not controversial and one we in the Labour Party are happy to support.  Some issues arise from it, however, which we want addressed.  The growth in our population and in energy use requires investment in the energy infrastructure that has in the past experienced under-investment.  The margin of cover between demand and supply is so narrow, fears have been expressed about outages resulting during winter months.  Over the next 20 years demand is estimated to grow by 70% to 80% which will require the connection of 7,000 MW of new generation plant to the network.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Creating an all-Ireland market was a significant step forward, ensuring security of supply and greater efficiencies.  Paying tribute to those working in EirGrid and their counterparts in Northern Ireland is worthwhile as the all-Ireland market they succeeded in creating has been working ever since.  Building interconnectors between Ireland, Britain and, if necessary, beyond is the next logical step and is a welcome development.  It would offer us the facility to buy additional electricity from abroad and to sell excess electricity.  In doing so, we could fully exploit our natural resources, in particular wind energy.  This development would ensure energy security, a significant current issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Were the Minister consistent in his approach, it would be helpful.  It is regrettable that, for example, he has obfuscated on the issue of nuclear power.  The Minister has no intention of pursuing the nuclear power option.  His call for a debate on the issue is an evasive technique, a smokescreen.  Having called for the debate, he refuses to initiate it and ducks the matter when it is raised.  Were the Minister's open approach a genuine one, he would initiate the debate rather than try to offload it on to an Oireachtas committee.  Were he honest on this issue, he would first lift the statutory prohibition on the building of nuclear power stations in Ireland.  It is illegal to build a nuclear station in Ireland.  Were the Minister genuine in his call for a debate, he would present the case in the Dáil for legalising nuclear power and proceed to debate the question of whether we should avail of that option.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">——that recognises the Parliament's integrity.  We should not waste time debating something that is illegal and to which the Government has repeatedly displayed its opposition simply to let the Minister off the hook.  If he wants a debate, he is in a position to set the conditions and the context.  It is self-serving for him to reply to my parliamentary question that he wants a debate, but that "the Government fully intends to maintain the statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland".  Let us see consistency.  It is worth noting that in terms of future policies on power generation, we have a prohibition on nuclear power.  It is for the Government to propose removing the prohibition if we are to consider the option seriously.  I oppose the option, but it is a matter for debate, which is not what the Minister wants.  It is also worth noting that we are already using electricity from nuclear power supplied through the interconnector between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain.  More will be supplied via the interconnector under discussion in the context of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The all-Ireland grid study has provided a clear strategy based on maximising renewables and wind in particular.  These natural resources are free, but significant investment is required to harness them.  The study states: "These additional costs will need to be recovered within the price of electricity charged to end users."  The estimated figure is approximately €650 million and €1 billion for the island as a whole.  It is clear that the customer will pay.  We must remember that in terms of electricity bills, the customer is already paying more than the European average.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Recently, the ESB launched its strategic framework to 2020, the cost of which will be €22 billion, €4 billion on renewables, €6.5 billion on smart metering and other structures and a €11 billion investment in networks.  The customer will foot the bill.  It is clear that the intention is to use the customer indefinitely as some kind of cash cow.  In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister stated: "All investments in electricity transmission and distribution networks are funded through use-of-system charges approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation".  This over-reliance on the consumer is a matter of some concern and it is important that a full economic analysis is carried out to ensure that it is sustainable as well as fair to depend solely on the consumer to fund such ambitious plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">This Bill provides for EirGrid to construct, own and run an interconnector and to borrow up to €750 million.  Elements of the Bill are straightforward and I do not foresee a problem in that regard.  It is worth noting that the transformation in the energy market has been successful in the sense that we have been able to ensure public control over key facilities while opening the market up simultaneously.  There is a lesson to be learned here.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Yesterday when we debated the Estimates for the Department, the Minister stated that a token amount had been inserted into the budget in case it proved more advantageous for the Government to raise the loan rather than for EirGrid to do so.  It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify why such an approach is being adopted in this case as it seems to be unprecedented in terms of Government assistance for energy infrastructure.  Exploring what is occurring would be of interest.  The norm has been for the customer to pay and the State to benefit.  The dividend paid to the State, for example, by the ESB is considerable — approximately €80 million, I cannot remember the figure — and it goes directly into the maw of the Department of Finance.  It would make more sense to permit the ESB to plough this funding into its own development.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">This is not the Bill that was promised.  In the briefing given to the Minister upon taking office, the EirGrid Bill was an immediate priority issue, but it was a Bill to transfer ownership of transmission assets from the ESB to EirGrid.  Priority drafting of the Bill was promised, but it has stalled nine months on.  To break up the ESB in the way proposed has serious implications and the Labour Party is not convinced that any break-up of the ESB or the transfer of its core grid and generation assets makes sense.  It is likely that the proposal to remove the transmission system from the ESB is unnecessary for competition and threatens the long-term national interest and energy security of the people.  The introduction of the all-Ireland single electricity market and the entry of new providers have altered the dominant role of the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">With further proposals for divestment and site sharing in the White Paper, the ESB is set to become a mainly network company with some key strategic generation assets.  The Government's proposal to transfer assets to EirGrid opens up the possibility of the emasculation of the ESB as a player here and internationally and, while not the Minister's intention, could lead to the future privatisation of the ESB with all the dangers of externally controlled generation in a small isolated market.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The Minister should consider the change of heart that has been taking place at EU level.  There is no longer a conviction that competition is best served by dismantling state power companies and selling them off.  France, Germany and six other EU countries have argued that the Commission's proposals to unbundle vertically integrated energy firms will not achieve their desired effect in terms of more grid investments and lower energy prices.  Obliging energy-producing firms to give up their transmission assets is "not compatible with constitutional law and with the free movement of capital", according to the letter to the Commission signed by France, Germany and others, which argues that "no correlation can be found between the implementation of [ownership unbundling] and the levels of prices and investments which are actually determined by many other factors".</p>

          <p eId="para_489">It is worth including the point in the debate because this is an extremely important issue.  When I have raised this point in the past, the Minister has adopted what appears to me to be a highly facile view to the effect that as we have got this far, we may as well finish the job.  This underestimates the impact on the ESB of the proposed break up in terms of its capacity to compete.  While Members already have learned that trade unions are extremely concerned about this issue, it is clear, particularly given the dominance of Russia, that changes of policy and opinion within Europe have occurred and it is worth our while to listen.  My only point at present is that I hope the Government is listening.  While I am unsure it is, I hope this is what is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">To be fair, the Green Party Members did promise there would be more rain.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">These issues are becoming more central.  I refer to environmental concerns and concerns regarding energy security such as, for example, the recent increase in the cost of oil to a record high of $120 per barrel.  This represents a fivefold increase in oil prices since 2002.  Obviously, Ireland does not produce its own oil and is highly energy-dependent.  I understand that our total energy import dependency is well in excess of 91% at present.   We must make radical changes and in general, the Minister has Members' support.  I hope he accepts there is a genuine commitment in this regard and understands it is not an easy task to turn around and adopt a new approach in respect of energy.  While I understand that opportunities were missed in the past, ultimately it is the job of Members to ensure that when policy is developed, it is fair and meets needs.  Members must ensure that such requirements always will be complied with.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The Labour Party has a clear energy strategy.  It wants to ensure there is a clear and reliable supply of energy, as well as a long-term sustainable environment.  We must ensure that energy is affordable.  The poorest members of our society are those who often bear the greatest burden in respect of energy costs.  In this context, I will refer to a small matter that would have made a great difference.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently omitted to state that he would introduce a waiver scheme for waste charges for the poor and the elderly.  The Labour Party has argued for a national waiver scheme to assist people pay for waste.  Obviously, the costs of waste disposal have increased greatly.  This constitutes an example, which also is applicable to the energy arena, in which people on low incomes are not being supported.  This applies to waste management, ensuring that people's houses are energy efficient and to rising energy bills.  It is estimated that between 60,000 and 100,000 households suffer from fuel poverty.  The people affected must be deemed to be deserving of support and I do not believe that ignoring them will enable us to develop a policy that is both fair and efficient and which meets people's needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I greatly welcome the proposal to have an interconnection between Ireland and Britain.  A number of interconnections will be developed.  One already is there and there is potential for more.  We may connect to mainland Europe at some point or we may depend on the British connection.  However, such interconnections are indicators of a new relationship between these islands and between North and South that will ensure, in a practical way, that we work together for the betterment of our societies and for the environment as a whole.  It offers us an opportunity to develop natural resources, particularly in respect of wind power, that had not been developed in the past.  The Minister is keen to encourage technology development in Ireland and hopefully this can be achieved and manifested in practical ways because the costs of technological investigation and experimentation often can pose great difficulties for smaller entrepreneurs or innovators.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I wish to cite some concerns.  Although I raised them by way of a parliamentary question, it was ruled out of order.  Although I have been in the House for a while and have shadowed many Ministers, I have never had so many parliamentary questions ruled out of order by a Minister.  For some reason, however, this Minister deflects many parliamentary questions.  I am bemused by this practice because I do not consider that to be his inclination.  In respect of offshore wind, I asked how many turbines had been granted approval, what were their heights and what is the current position because just before the election, the Green Party Leader, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, made a commitment that no new permissions would be granted without legislation permitting public consultation.  I am sure the Minister has a copy of the relevant letter as I certainly have.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The question was deflected from the Minister's Department in a manner that I found difficult to stomach.  Although I asked the question I am unable to get an answer.  My understanding, although I am open to correction, is that permission for approximately 400 turbines was granted off the coast of County Wicklow.  This has given rise to great concern because the public has not been given a chance to express their views, good bad or indifferent, on this development.  The turbines in question, were they ever to materialise, would be sited relatively close to shore and would be very tall.  Were they located on land, the normal planning process would apply and everything would be hunky dory.  A decision would be made and people at least would have been consulted.  However, no consultation process in respect of planning exists in respect of offshore wind turbines.  While guidelines and regulations have been developed to prevent major visual intrusion or impact in other countries, this has not happened here.  This is regrettable because offshore wind is a great resource and we must ensure it is developed in a manner that is not unduly intrusive.  I agree the North-South line should not have been called an interconnector.  There was an element of massaging involved inasmuch as calling it a "North-South interconnector" makes it sound important.  It is not an interconnector and that word probably frightened people more than it impressed them.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Minister has a difficult decision to make because if the underground option is chosen it will set a precedent for other infrastructure projects.  I would love to see these lines going underground for various reasons, as would members of the public who live along the route.  For environmental, visual, safety and other reasons, it would be a step forward but I do not know how feasible it would be and I suspect the report will not support that option.  However, public concern has been so great that we need a full debate in the Dáil when it is published.  I welcome the promise by the Minister to publish before the end of the summer session so that we can have a debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Notwithstanding that, I want this piece of energy infrastructure to proceed.  In the context of our growing needs, it is vital that we have safe, reliable and flexible infrastructure which benefits both parts of the island and, in respect of the east-west interconnector, both countries in ways that would have been impossible to imagine in the past, despite the technological advances we have already made on undersea telecommunications cables.  This is an exciting project which everybody wants to be successful and I welcome the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_502">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I will focus on the effect of the EirGrid proposal on my county and the pylons from Woodland through County Cavan to Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Any potential health risk posed by overhead power lines is unacceptable.  Pollutants from electromagnetic fields produced by overhead lines will subject the weakest and most vulnerable in our communities to the possibility of illness and distress.  If technology can facilitate the laying of cables underground from Rush to Woodland, County Meath, consideration must be given to laying them underground the rest of the way to Kingscourt, County Cavan, and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">There are a number of other reasons for considering the underground option.  The negative visual impact on our landscape of the pylons will militate against the development of tourism in the area.  The pylons will also have a detrimental effect on protected wildlife and their habitats and they will traverse areas rich in cultural and archaeological heritage and special areas of conservation.  Another issue that must be borne in mind is the threat they will pose to property values along its route.  Putting the line underground appears to be the safest means of ensuring a secure and reliable electricity service to the area.  The possibility of over-ground pylons being part of the EirGrid plan for Meath has been a major cause for concern among local people, particularly those who live close to area through which the pylons may pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The main argument against the use of pylons is on health grounds, an issue that all Deputies will agree is of the utmost importance.  Since 2000, 107 scientific papers have been published in peer reviewed journals, of which 69 linked electromagnetic fields to various forms of cancer, 30 were inconclusive and only eight showed no links.  Research carried out in Britain in 2005 found that living within 200 metres of high voltage power lines increases a child's chance of getting leukaemia by 69%.  Within 600 metres it was increased by an average of 20%.  All technology carries benefits and risks which have to be carefully weighed at all times.  I do not doubt the significant benefit of a sustainable electricity supply but in this instance the alternative option of going underground appears to eliminate risk and should therefore be given consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Another reason for thinking carefully about overhead lines is ecology.  The issue of climate change and our responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions has been brought centre stage.  Putting the North-South interconnector and future proposed extra high voltage lines underground may be significantly more environmentally responsible than the construction of overhead pylons.  Another advantage of going underground is a smaller carbon footprint due to reduced land use and material choice.  While an overhead line requires a 60 m wide strip to be kept permanently clear for safety, maintenance and repair reasons, an underground cable of the same capacity requires only 10 m.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">In today's world we are more aware than ever of the need to protect our environment.  As the age of industrialisation and new technologies, the 20th century saw many advances.  Our world has changed significantly in a relatively short period.  This generation has been tasked with responding to the challenge of protecting our environment and undoing the damage that has already been done.  By putting the lines underground we will be playing a small part in protecting the environment.  The underground route would eliminate the noise pollution associated with overhead lines.  We are all aware of the constant buzz that accompanies overhead lines which can irritate residents in their vicinity.  An underground route also eliminates collision and electrocution hazards related to wildlife and, in particular, birds.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Farmers and landowners are opposed to the use of pylons on their land for a number of practical reasons.  Farmers describe the difficulties of working around pylons in fields.  An underground route would eliminate this problem completely.  Farmers are also legitimately concerned about having to work on a daily basis under overhead lines.  Nobody would want to put their own or their family's health at risk, regardless of how small that risk may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">It should also be remembered that land and property devaluation can be a consequence of overhead power lines.  I understand that planning permission for new houses will not be allowed within 200 m of an overhead 400 kV line, which virtually eliminates many fields with roadside frontage from planning applications.  EirGrid proposes to place the lines closer than 50 m to existing dwellings.  More than 60 studies have been carried out over the last 50 years on the impact of overhead power lines on the value of residential property.  The most common claims cited in court cases in America are reductions in market price, properties being slower to sell and a decrease in sales volumes.  Issues such as visual and noise pollution were often identified as negative influences on property values.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">In assessing the choice of going over or underground, the issue of our heritage and landscape cannot be ignored.  It is impossible to put a price on our special heritage because it is part of all of us.  The north east is an area rich in heritage, from archaeological sites which are world famous to scenic landscapes that need protection from visually obtrusive structures.  Locals are understandably concerned about the effect of overhead lines on areas that are of vast historic significance.  While the issue of costs has been raised by those who are in favour of taking the overhead route, can a price be put on people's health and well-being and the heritage of a special part of our country?  I have seen reports that suggest the additional cost passed on to the consumer due to going underground would come to no more than €2.20 per month.  Is this too high a price to pay for peace of mind for thousands of people?</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I am aware that there are two sides to every argument.  I welcome the fact that an independent study on the EirGrid interconnector is taking place.  The study commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has broad terms of reference that allow it to examine several aspects of the interconnector, including the cost of putting it underground.  This is an issue that requires careful consideration.  The interests of the people living in the areas affected must be borne in mind at all times and must come ahead of any monetary or business considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I thank the Minister for commissioning the study.  We are all delighted he has done so and we await the outcome.  We hope it will allow the cables to be placed underground.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_513">Like Deputy Johnny Brady, I am glad to speak on this issue.  In the last review of constituencies when I became a candidate, Deputy Brady had to hand over several lovely areas such as Moynalty, Carlanstown, Nobber, Gibbstown, Kilmainhamwood, Oristown and Meath Hill.  There is genuine fear in those communities with regard to EirGrid's proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">While this is a technical, enabling Bill, I am glad the Minister recognised the public concerns in his speech.  He referred to the complexity of the task facing EirGrid.  Would it be possible to make even slight amendments to the Bill in terms of what EirGrid may be required to do when it proposes projects above and beyond what is contained in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act?  When EirGrid comes to the town, there is never a show like it.  Chaos reigns and people fear, as we have seen time and again.  An extra level of consultation should be required specifically for EirGrid.  There is nothing else like it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I have been to meetings attended by almost the entire population of parishes, which I am sure has also been the experience in other counties.  There are massive concerns, including with regard to health.  One can read all the WHO studies one likes, but when one visits communities where there are already pockets of cancer, it is impossible to argue there is no health risk, particularly as many studies recognise this risk, as pointed out by Deputy Brady.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The people of County Meath are very concerned about the visual impact given our tourism potential and the innate beauty of the county and the wildlife.  I am conscious that Gibbstown is a Gaeltacht area.  It is a great community but there is much fear about the impact on the culture and heritage of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Planning permission is one of the biggest issues for families in rural Ireland at present, particularly for those working in agriculture.  There will be many restrictions in the north east if this project goes ahead.  The right of people to live on their own land and contribute to their communities will be put in serious jeopardy.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Minister gladly took on board the huge public concern.  He made a wise decision to commission a study because there are arguments for and against the proposal.  While EirGrid put up a very strong argument that the cost of its plans is low, what price our health, environment and heritage?  I have met people who claim the lines could be put underground for a fraction of the cost and in a simple way.  What the Minister has done with the independent study is very welcome, as is its short time frame.  We look forward to the findings and hope the study will provide what we consider to be the right answer, which is to put the lines underground.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">To do that would have major implications throughout the country.  There are already many 400 kV lines.  If, as we hope, the lines go underground in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, then lines elsewhere would also have to be considered, and future projects would have to be undertaken along the lines of the findings of this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The Government is often accused of not planning developments but it cannot be accused of not planning for future energy needs.  Interconnectors are part of this process and the people of Meath accept this.  They are always happy to see progress, for example, with regard to the M3.  The M3 is a balance between the needs of our people and protecting our heritage but EirGrid's proposals for County Meath are significantly unbalanced and balanced against the ordinary man and women in the lane and road — we do not have many streets in north Meath.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The Government is focused on planning, as it must be because energy is a key requirement and the country must be kept alight.  We can see the result of the Israeli blockade in the Holy Land, where the UN is running out of fuel and may have to stop operations.  That is a particular case concerning energy supply.  We must look after this country for the decades and generations to come.  The people will support the Government in this regard and will welcome anything which helps them to plan their daily lives and businesses better.  However, they demand that the lines be put underground.  I will give them every support I can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_522">My colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford, should have been first to speak.  I am grateful to him for allowing me to speak first because I must travel to another region later this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the Minister knows, we soldiered together in a common cause on these and similar issues in the past four years or so, certainly in the past two and a half years.  I am glad some of the thinking process that was put in place at that time is coming to fruition and that we are moving in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">It is very important from the perspective of the most important people of all — the consumers — that the interconnector is in place.  It should be available and accessible so that in the event that we wish to sell some of our product, we can do so, and if we wish to purchase product from other jurisdictions, for valid reasons, we can do that also.  This is part of the reinforcement of both the European grid and the national grid, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The proposal in the legislation is that the grid will remain with EirGrid and in its control, unless the Minister gives permission otherwise.  The present Minister is unlikely to give such permission, but one never knows.  We cannot think too far into the future, other than to say that, from past experience, it is very important that the State would hold firm control over a development of this nature, whether it be the North-South or east-west interconnector, but particularly the North-South interconnector as it is likely to happen first.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The east-west interconnector is hovering somewhere.  There was originally provision for an interconnector to be developed by public private partnership or joint enterprise.  I do not know how quickly it is progressing but it needs to be accelerated.  If this country wants to maintain its economic expansion and development to the same extent as before, to which we should aspire, we must have access to a reliable and extensive power grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">As noted by other speakers, in building up the various alternatives of electricity generation, we will be able to offload or sell product at will provided we have interconnectors available.  We cannot store or bottle electricity yet, although I am sure that will happen in due course.  However, in the absence of that technology, it is essential we have an interconnector to develop our electricity industry.  It is essential to recognise that it should be used as a means of developing the extent and role of our electricity industry, not as a means of copping out or importing energy of all descriptions.  It must be to facilitate both directions because our alternative energy in the entire area could be threatened in terms of development and expansion if we relied too much on the imported product.  I have made that point to the Minister previously in committee and it must be borne in mind in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I am aware the Minister has set up a high powered committee to study the question of underground versus over-ground cables, which is a thorny issue.  I have repeatedly put down questions in this House over the years to try to determine the degrees of cancer county by county and by region.  That would give us some indication of what we are dealing with in terms of absolute proof.  We can speculate about it.  The Minister is aware we had the debate in the committee on the issue of electromagnetic waves and the serious damage involved.  We have had proof and counter-proof, contradiction and counter contradiction until we were almost blue in the face.  Groups of experts from both sides confused each other, and in the process thereof confused us, as to whether one or either was the right opinion.  That major argument will continue until we get proof positive and that can only be done by way of statistics and those statistics can be gleaned only by using the kind of information I have suggested.  The Department of Health and Children could do it or even the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, if it so wished.  We can then highlight authoritatively the areas throughout the country that show a prevalence of cancer cases of one kind or another.  It is not rocket science.  We should just get the proof.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The visual impact of over-ground pylons is another issue because they can cause problems in tourist sensitive areas.  We had that debate previously in committee also and it is difficult to argue against putting cables underground in a tourism sensitive area with lovely vistas.  Erecting pylons along the skyline does not sell tourism.  The option, therefore, is to opt for underground cables.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In the argument for going underground the case has been made that it is done in Holland but Holland has a vastly different terrain.  The subterranean formations in the Netherlands are vastly different from the subterranean formations in Kerry, Donegal and such places.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Another issue that arises is distance.  There is a huge difference between the journey across the Netherlands and the journey from Cashel to Burtonport, for instance, or somewhere like that.  A fair amount of undergrounding would be involved in that and the substantial cost factor arises but it must be examined for two reasons, namely the visual impact and the possible health hazard.  We should either make up our minds about it or stop talking about it.  If expert groups and committees eventually come up with a conclusion the Ministers do not like they can abandon, adjourn or strangle the committee, so to speak.  This is likely to become an issue that will not go away unless the issues are addressed.  It could have a major effect on the development of the electricity industry in terms of transmission here and I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I want to mention briefly the importance of the development of wind and wave energy and all that goes with it.  There will always be environmental side effects.  Objections will and have been made to the windmills or turbines on hill tops.  We cannot please everybody all the time but in the event of a serious problem arising, the Minister and future Ministers must determine what we are likely to be faced with 20 or 25 years from now and decide which is the lesser of two evils.  Do we want to be able to provide a service and how can we provide it or run the risk of there being insufficient power to meet the requirements of the grid?  That will be the crunch factor.  The Minister knows that as he is very conversant with it.  The defining issue will be how to determine the full extent of the requirement in 20 or 25 years time, recognise the means of transmission and what must be done to deliver that to the public, and the need to ensure we have security or continuity of supply as the case may be.  Those three factors are crucial because it will be important to be able to tell the consumer now that in 20 or 25 years they can rely on continuity of supply, a competitively priced supply and that their kettle will boil in the morning when they want to make a cup of tea or coffee.  Nothing will concentrate the mind more than absence of energy in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I am aware other legislation is promised on the break-up of the ESB.  One changes one's mind from time to time about matters of this nature.  I was involved in producing a policy on the break-up of the ESB.  I was not as specific as the Government at the time, and the Minister will be aware of that, but I supported the concept of sub-dividing the ESB under the various headings.  That is welcome provided the customer enjoys the benefit accruing from it in terms of cost, competition, efficiency and quality of service.  There is no sense in having competition among a multiplicity of groups responsible if the consumer is left wondering which of them to approach to have their lights turned back on.  It is of no consolation to anybody if that consumer is wondering whether it is the grid, the generator or the person in charge of transmission and distribution that is responsible.  I ask the Minister, who will make decisions in this area and will have a major influence on it, having spoken to the various interested bodies, to consider that aspect carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The notion that we must do this because of European legislation is nonsense and wrong.  It does not work that way.  European legislation is part and parcel of what we contribute to, which becomes European legislation, as the Minister knows well.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We had a dreadful experience with Eircom.  I am not blaming Eircom but what an appalling journey to come to where we are from where we were.  We went from the head of the posse ten years ago in terms of the development of telecommunications in the European pecking order to a position where we are playing catch-up.  That is appalling and it came about as a result of bad decisions.  I do not say that because I held that view all along.  Various parties in the House, including my party, were in favour of the procedure being followed at the time.  I was not and was concerned about it.  I was subsequently proved to be correct but I am not saying it because of that.  I say this because we must learn from our past experiences.  There is no point going through hardship and the barbs which come with it unless we take lessons on board and act so it does not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Somebody suggested, in the context of Aer Lingus, that in changing services from Shannon, the company had a duty to its shareholders.  That is correct, as all companies have a duty to shareholders.  However, it is not the ultimate and only responsibility, and there is also a duty and responsibility to the consumer, the State and the greater common good.  This must be borne in mind at all times and can never be set aside, buried or subsumed by something else.  We must recognise that for some unknown reason, we have not come to grips with that concept in this country just yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Privatisation is everywhere in the United States, and they seem to have been able to convince everybody about it.  It is provided for in legislation that services are divided in order to create competition but there is still a responsibility to provide that service.  If that does not happen, or does not occur in the way it was intended to be operated to ensure the customer has continuity and security in service, which is competitive and satisfactory, the service would not start to begin with.  We must come to grips with that issue, particularly with regard to State and semi-State bodies proposed for privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I am not a prisoner of either idea and both have a meaningful role to play.  However, companies should operate to the benefit of the consumer.  It is nonsense and untrue to say the investor comes first.  If an investor is to come first, one should buy a bank or other institution in the money business.  When interest rates drop, there is a greater tendency for utility services to be used by the investment sector as if they were banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I do not blame them as there is a current example with the oil business.  I would love to be a shareholder in that business and have bought shares four, five or six years ago.  I would be in the Caribbean now if I had done so, rolling in sunshine, and rightly so because I would have made a huge fortune.  Every day oil prices are being talked up.  A similar concept for utility services — also an energy business — is something we must watch for very carefully.  We must consider that in whatever structure the Minister eventually arrives at with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">If what I outlined does happen — I know it will not — I will kick up a terrible row if I am still alive at the end of it.  Consumers' interests and requirements must be met first, last and always.  Those wishing to invest are welcome and we are delighted to assist and encourage such behaviour, which is part and parcel of the process, as long as the customer does not become the victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I will refer to a couple of points on wind generation.  We have all agreed that such technology in this country must be the means of producing electricity that is most likely to succeed, as there is a never-ending supply of raw material.  There is no question that if the wind dies down around our coasts, we could even generate a fair amount of warm air, from time to time, in this House and various other assemblies.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The process must be done sensitively.  A far greater proportion of electricity requirements can be met from wind sources, provided we go into locations sensitively.  We must utilise modern technology as well.  When this type of electricity generation was first mooted, capabilities were less than 25 kV and the concept of a wind farm had not developed.  Individual turbines can now produce approximately 5 kV and their output is growing and will continue to do so.  We can get accustomed to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">It is ironic that, as people are worried about cancer being caused by pylons and cables, there may be a similar problem with turbines because of the transmission of electricity and rotation of the blades.  They are a source of health concerns for some so the Minister should, to head such concerns off, nail down the best possible independent information.  We can discuss such concerns and take them out of the arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The future role of EirGrid must be carefully monitored and strong.  We must ensure nobody gets a hold of an interconnector east, west, north, south or otherwise which might create a "ransom strip".  We have all heard of these from development of lands.  Those in possession of such a ransom strip prevent all other development and an interconnector could become the ultimate ransom strip.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The Minister must give long and careful thought to the rest of the ESB structure reappraisal and development.  He will need to carefully consider the options and discussions with the unions.  People may blame the ESB and unions for various things but it has been a tremendous company that has given tremendous service.  It has been reliable and has gone overseas with technology to effectively assist those in need across the water.  It is a big operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I hope economies of scale, attainable through big companies such as the ESB and others, continue in future.  Otherwise the customer will lose.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy Martin Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I welcome the Bill and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Interconnection has a history going back at least 30 years, or as far back as the Cork to Midleton railway line, for example.  I used to be an official dealing with energy in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the late 1970s and top of the agenda at the Taoiseach's Department at that time was east-west interconnection.  It was politicised to the extent that it was being pushed as a strategic objective.  It clearly had important energy policy dimensions and I remember attending talks in the Department of Energy in Millbank, where this was discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The economics at that time never quite came together.  As the Minister referred to in his speech, there was also the dimension of the North-South interconnector, which was disrupted and destroyed by IRA bombs.  How that was supposed to contribute to the unity of the country is about as puzzling as putting devices on the Dundalk-Newry railway line, which still happens occasionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">As Deputy Durkan alluded to, there was at that time a little bit of what one may term "insular geopolitics" involved in both electricity and gas sectors.  If there was to be any electricity interconnection between Ireland and Britain, Northern officials were anxious to have it go across the North Channel.  We were equally determined that it would be an Ireland-Wales interconnector.  Most of those considerations have given way to those which relate to what is in the interests of different countries and jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The North-South interconnectors were restored some time ago and there is now a single energy market on the island of Ireland.  These are beneficial developments but they only marginally improve the economies of scale.  When I worked as an adviser in the Taoiseach's office, I recall discussing with representatives of the ESB the Coolkeeragh plant on the north coast.  The capacity of said plant was going to exceed the natural needs of Northern Ireland and the excess was going to feed into the north-west region of the Republic, primarily County Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I have no doubt about the value and importance of interconnection, particularly when energy supply at an affordable price is at risk.  One must try to achieve the economies and that can only be done by sharing with larger markets.  I welcome the fact that EirGrid will be the vehicle for doing this and I am glad the latter will remain in public ownership.  In general, I believe strategic infrastructure should be in public ownership because the Government or public authorities can then react to situations and are not obliged to persuade, bribe or compel private operators to take actions which, for purely financial reasons, they may not be inclined to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The previous speaker referred to the ESB being in public ownership and the question of competition.  Many of the European laws that deal with such matters are primarily designed to cater for much larger national and transnational markets.  France has a large market and the Government of that country is determined to retain control of EDF.  I regard the ESB as one of our most efficient semi-State companies.  Since its formation 80 or so years ago, it has done a superb job.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The unions in the ESB are quite powerful.  Yesterday, we paid tribute to the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, whose first achievement as Minister for Labour in May 1987 was to solve a serious dispute in the ESB.  When people seek competition and when private companies press governments for a slice of the market, what they are really seeking is a slice of the monopoly.  It is felt that there can be perverse situations in which one is obliged to raise the price of electricity in order to attract competitors into the market so that, in the long-term, it is hoped, the price will fall below a level than would otherwise the case.  I am sceptical about this line of thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I previously held a negative view of a certain trade union official — I will not name him because he is outside the House — who seemed at one point to want to "Scargillise" the railways.  However, I find myself somewhat more in agreement with his views on the ESB.  If there is to be a monopoly — it may be difficult to avoid it in light of the relatively small size of the market — a near monopoly or a duopoly, the ESB is a fine company in that regard and falls under a fair degree of Government control.  When working as a civil servant in the late 1970s, I observed that it sometimes seemed that the ESB was rather more in control than either the Government of the day or those civil servants who were nominally in charge.  That was at a time when the Government was being pressed very hard on the nuclear project.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The legislation and the concept of interconnection make a great deal of sense.  Arguably, they are both vital in the context of expanding the market for renewables.  A great deal of renewable energy is of a fluctuating nature.  Wind energy is an obvious example.  In a small market, it is not possible to become dependent on wind energy for more than a certain percentage of one's needs because one will otherwise put one's supply at risk.  However, fully operational interconnection with a very large market completely alters the context.  The establishment of interconnection is necessary if one is to make serious progress with wind generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Minister is probably more conscious than anyone else that the term "green" — I do not use it in its strictly political sense — is much abused.  There are often competing points of view that each claims to be greener than each other.  Partly as a result of my experience of local controversies in County Tipperary, I would not be completely enamoured of land-based wind generation.  Pushed beyond a certain point, the latter would conflict with tourism and amenity objectives.  There are some locations to which land-based wind generation is particularly suited.  Equally, however, there are others to which it is not appropriate.  I appeal to the Minister not to adopt an attitude that wind energy in unlimited amounts is good, regardless of where the turbines etc. relating to it are located.  Serious environmental conflicts or disputes could arise if we were to push too hard in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I have very few reservations with regard to offshore wind generation.  Most of the time one cannot see the wind turbines on the Arklow banks.  If one can see them at all, they appear almost as matchsticks on the horizon.  The turbines on the Arklow banks do not interfere with amenities in any serious way.  The volume of wind at sea is probably much more constant than it is on land.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">As the Minister is probably aware, Scotland, which is similar to Ireland, has serious restrictions on where it will allow large-scale wind generation projects to be located.  In the past week, the public authority on one of the Outer Hebrides rejected plans for a very large wind energy project on the grounds that it would interfere with the amenities and tourism attractions of the island.  Another aspect of interconnection — I am referring here to interconnection with Britain — is that it means we will be importing nuclear energy among other things.  The Minister probably chose not to refer to this matter or if he did refer to it, he did so only briefly.  I do not have a particular problem with that and do not regard nuclear as a moral issue, although practical and safety issues arise.  Broadly speaking, I agree with the Minister's views on nuclear energy.  We have a small market for the standard economic nuclear power station.  I remember the Taoiseach being very puzzled when a number of pro-nuclear experts were putting their case as if to ask in which constituency they were proposing to locate such a facility.  Notwithstanding the arguments that have been made, it would be very difficult at this point to find any constituency in Ireland that would accept a nuclear power station.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">There are also reservations about the economics of nuclear power.  It is no accident that some of the major civil nuclear powers also run military nuclear installations so some economies of scale may have been achieved that are invisible to the public eye, not least in technological research.  The British Government has had to stump up tens of billions to decommission nuclear waste.  British taxpayers must be very forbearing because they do not seem to bat an eyelid at the cost of the nuclear industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Notwithstanding the fact that a generation after Carnsore Point some nuclear advocates want to re-examine the question — I have no objection to the matter being debated — for political and economic reasons and the question of consent, the arguments do not really add up.  While I may be arguing against myself, if one has interconnection, in theory the relatively small size of the island market here would no longer necessarily be an objection, but the other considerations also kick in.  In addition, I would be fearful of a terrorist attack.  The attacks on the Twin Towers in New York literally came out of the blue one morning.  One never knows what might be attempted next, despite all the precautions.  Eventually, over time, when nothing happens, people lower their guard and there is more opportunity to strike again.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Even 12 months ago we were keen to promote bio-fuels and the European Union also has a programme for promoting them.  They were getting a favourable wind but now we are reading headlines about world food shortages so a certain degree of caution is required.  If one looks at the matter purely in an Irish context, there is no doubt that there has been a trend towards the extensification of agriculture, although we are certainly nowhere near producing our maximum.  People keep referring to us as a small island whereas we are the third largest island in Europe.  The Romans got that one right but we tend to get it wrong.  We may be an island with a relatively small population but we are not a small island.  In other words, we have land which can be used for bio-fuels and forestry without materially affecting or prejudicing mainstream agricultural production, the WTO and Commissioner Mandelson willing.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">If one drinks too much water one will drown so all good things are good in moderation but not to excess.  The problem is that one gets enthusiasms for alternative energy, such as bio-fuels, and while there is much scope in these areas nothing should be done to excess or uncritically.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I do not know whether the Minister mentioned the figure in his speech, but as I understand it we are approximately 90% dependent on energy imports at the moment.  I can remember at the time of the second oil crisis the figure used for Ireland was 80% and the aim was to bring that down.  One matter of concern, which is rarely discussed in this House because of its sensitivity, is the delay in bringing natural gas ashore on the Mayo coast.  While the matter was perhaps approached clumsily at first, there have been many attempts to accommodate reasonable demands.  It is not right that a protest group should be holding things up on national policy grounds.  The House and the Government are elected to deal with energy policy issues and to make democratic decisions about them, including the terms of oil and gas exploration.  That is a matter that should be left to this House.  With the alteration of the pipeline, I hope that the larger interests of the country might be taken into account and the protest will draw to a close.  It has been prolonged and has cost the Garda Síochána a great deal of money and resources, which could have been better used elsewhere.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_565">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I asked many times on the Order of Business that this Bill or the other legislation concerning EirGrid be brought before the House to give us an opportunity to speak on the overall situation and interconnection in particular.  I hope the Minister will not mind me speaking on cross-Border grid structures, as Deputies Johnny Brady and Thomas Byrne have done.  Such structures can be called an interconnector or part of an all-Ireland grid.  I welcome the statements by both aforementioned Deputies because some of the comments that were being made at meetings earlier in the year certainly differed from them.  I congratulate the north-east pressure group on the message it got across to people there.  I refer to the press release from North East Pylon Pressure, regarding the position in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, headed "EirGrid ‘compensation' offers €1 billion to the cost of the pylon lines":</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">According to a report in a local newspaper this weekend, EirGrid has admitted to Meath GAA that it would be willing to pay financial compensation to home and landowners in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan whose properties would be devalued as a direct result of siting overhead power lines near them.  Meath GAA Chairman, Cathal Seoighe, said EirGrid had indicated they were willing to set up a consultation and arbitration process to compensate home and land owners who could prove their properties had been devalued by pylons.  Colin Andrew, a spokesman for the North East Pylon Pressure campaign (NEPP) said: "EirGrid have now conceded the dramatic effects pylons have in devaluing property.  Our estimates confirm that — using averaged results from international studies, allowing for the housing density along the proposed route corridors, as well as average land prices — the overall cost of compensation will add between €800 and €1,000 million to the capital cost already admitted by EirGrid."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_567">"On this basis", Colin Andrew said, "NEPP's proposal to underground the cables is now seen clearly to be a far cheaper option than overground pylons.  Underground has the additional cost saving of cheaper maintenance and increased reliability and it helps the environment by reducing carbon dioxide emissions."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_568">NEPP notes EirGrid's undertaking that they would not erect pylons on GAA land or within 250 metres of GAA property.  We see that as an important admission by them of the health dangers posed.  We now call on them to take one more step.  They must undertake not to erect these massive pylons on any land in the North East.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_569">NEPP calls on the Minister for Energy, Eamon Ryan, to see the absolute folly of attempting to go against the wishes of the three County Councils affected, the GAA, Toilte Ireland, Meath IAVI, ICA and the ICMSA, and over 45,000 people potentially affected by this proposal.  The Minister must direct EirGrid to do the right thing — which now looks increasingly economically preferable — and underground the cables.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">It is important to read this into the record because it is not a press release from a way-off group but from a group that has put much work into what they are talking about.  I have met them, as have Deputies Brady and Byrne, at meetings where hundreds and sometimes thousands of people were present.  Everything must be done to ensure the group's anxieties are taken into account.  I welcome Deputy Conlon to the Chamber because she is in the middle of the situation and the cables will go through her home area.  People in the area take this extremely seriously and are extremely anxious about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This is part of an all-Ireland grid, and is not just a connector.  It will be used for wind farms to link in and power to be taken off.  It is not like the interconnector from here to Wales.  There is much anxiety and much work to be done by EirGrid and the Minister to address the situation and identify the best way forward.  I have spoken of the need for links with Northern Ireland and across the Irish Sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Last year, a well-known manufacturing company, Wellman of Mullagh, which has plants in Holland and France wrote to us and provided a graph with a breakdown of cost factors showing the cost of electricity in Mullagh to be almost twice what it paid for a similar plant in France.  Anyway we can minimise the cost of power to industry and farmers must be done, but in a way that is acceptable to everyone in the interests of health.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Deputy Brady referred to the visual issue and the problem with tourism.  These must be taken into account as well.  We must do that.  I record the Minister's willingness to debate this issue.  The Minister attended the committee, of which I am not a member but which I was allowed to attend, and listened to the concerns of members.  As the Minister stated in a letter later, as a result of the debate a decision was taken to undertake an independent study.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I am worried about the independence of the study when the information is from people who worked with EirGrid before.  It is difficult to see how they can be totally independent.  It is equally difficult to see how to get an accurate assessment done within 40 days.  I thank the Minister for taking this into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">We are in a time where people do not take things for granted as they did many years ago.  This is an era when people can contact others and get a group together quickly by text or other means.  If there is a power line from Clare to Dublin that is causing a problem, people have access to all kinds of information.  The folk in this pressure group are doing an incisive job on getting information.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I have a close friend who, along with his two brothers, built a house recently and will be directly affected by the line.  They take this very seriously.  They are business people and want to see matters moving on.  They are not negative or raising this issue for the sake of being awkward.  I have been involved in some groups that are there for the sake of being awkward but that is not the case with this group.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Minister was present in the committee when colleagues showed the proposed layout for the future of the country.  It is at least ten times the distance of lines proposed to be extended after this.  If this is causing problems in our area, there is no doubt there will be problems in other areas.  If this can be resolved in an amicable way, the potential is there for further layout of the proposed cables to bring this country forward economically and with proper power.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The withdrawal of the other EirGrid Bill puzzles me.  It was promised but is being withdrawn.  I worry about the handover of issues to other bodies.  We have seen what happened with Eircom.  While there are all types of competitors for one's telephone bill, the reality is that we depend on Eircom for the telephone lines, in the main, especially in rural Ireland.  If one is trying to get broadband through Eircom in Martin Lodge or some other places in County Monaghan or County Cavan, one will find it extremely difficult.  A friend of mine, Mr. Nugent, has some 25 people working for him and they need broadband.  An Eircom representative arrived, did not know what was wanted and when told by one of the staff, said nothing could be done.  We do not want a situation such as that with the ESB and we would need to ensure we retain control so that we can get electricity lines whenever and wherever we want them.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I want to address a couple of other issues in the time I have left.  As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I am aware that one of the things being looked at by a sub-committee is the whole green energy situation.  We have visited Scotland in this regard.  Deputy Mansergh mentioned a short time ago what had happened on some of the islands in Scotland.  We have seen how they have moved forward as far as green energy is concerned, and certainly we have a good deal to learn from them.  They are dealing with wind offshore, biomass etc.  On visiting their biomass plant one sees them using poultry litter.  Not only are the farmers paid for the poultry litter, but they are also getting cheaper electricity.  That puts our problems in context as far as competition is concerned.  We certainly cannot compete with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Meat and bone meal has been utilised, also, in the UK to make electricity.  Yet we have exported it to Germany, one of the cleanest countries in the world, effectively giving them raw material for virtually nothing.  Our study has yet to be fully completed, but it will be encouraging the use of green energy as far as possible.  There is a massive windfarm in my constituency outside Cootehill in County Cavan.  It took years to get agreement on the interconnector there.  The people who wanted to go ahead with the first windfarm there had to go to Scotland for years, while awaiting Government approval to get that done.  If we are serious about moving the green energy forward and ensuring we have as much energy as possible here from the cheapest sources, then we must ensure the barriers are removed and that the people who want to are given the opportunity.  I believe there are 36 wind farmers in one group there and 19 in another.  There are also wind farms around Ballyconnell and some smaller units just outside Ballybay, near my home area.  It might be something the Minister could look at, but I understand that some of the cabling for the latter windfarm is actually underground, for whatever reason.  That might give him some idea of the cost factor and how, in a Monaghan situation, the costs underground compare with those over ground.  I do not have the figures, on hand, but it is very important that the Minister does this.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Another issue that will be problematic and, indeed, has already caused serious problems in our Border area constituency, is how pig units deal with their waste.  I would urge the Minister, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to re-examine that whole situation to determine how the energy generated may be utilised and how we can retain production there.  I realise some of the smaller units that have been forced out of business in the last few years would not be in a position to deal with that situation, and obviously the slurry product cannot be transferred too far.  However, it is a substance that should be used instead of bought-in fertiliser.  If it cannot be used in that way, then it should be utilised for the production of electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The Minister said, in his speech, that the purpose of the Bill was to provide EirGrid with the legislative underpinning to advance to the next stage of the east-west interconnector project.  That is to go ahead in September 2011 and the targeted date for completion of works is the end of March 2012.  This is very important, as I have said earlier and brings us to another subject, which the Minister has raised, namely, the whole issue of nuclear power.  The last speaker, Deputy Mansergh, mentioned this as well.  Nuclear power is something we all talk about and say we should not have, and all the rest of it.  However, when we have to compete with others who have it, we must see how we can benefit from it, in the event.  It is very much allied to how others produce food and get away with using hormones for the same markets as us, but we do not.  I believe we can get around this issue without too many scruples by having proper interconnection with the UK and perhaps, further on, into Europe.  Wellman is an example of the argument that we will continue to lose competitiveness, especially in manufacturing industry, if we do not and cannot produce the basics of power, water and all other energy inputs at a similar cost to our competitors.  I welcome the prospect of the interconnector being put in place and urge the Minister to ensure everything is done to facilitate this.  In doing that it will leave us not just open to competition but open to opportunity with wind, especially.  Someone said earlier that there could be wind in one place but not another.  However, if we are connected to a much larger Continent, we will be sure of guaranteed power, and we must be absolutely sure of that.  Gas and other issues are finite problems.  At the present time we are dependent on gas from the North Sea and Russia.  Russia might fall out with some countries, with extreme consequences not just for Ireland, but Europe.  In that context this interconnector is of extreme importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I wish the Minister well with this Bill and hope the matter can be sorted.  Before I finish I urge the Minister to ensure that a proper study is done into underground and over-ground costs for the north east.  I assure him I will work with him, as a public representative, to try to deal with the situation in a constructive proactive manner so that whatever the study shows will be positively dealt with.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">At budget time, an Exchequer deficit of €4,866 million was projected for this year.  This was based on an economic growth rate of 3% in GDP terms.  However, a number of risks to the economic forecast were identified, including the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the US, the possibility of adverse exchange rate movements, the possibility that financial market difficulties could persist for longer than assumed and the possibility of a sharper contraction in new house building.  It now appears that some of these risks have materialised and, in this regard, other economic commentators who produce forecasts on a more frequent basis have revised their forecasts downwards for growth in 2008.  The market consensus is now for GDP growth of around 2.25% this year, compared with 3.25% at budget time.  More modest growth would have implications for the evolution of the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">At the end of the first quarter, an Exchequer deficit of €354 million was recorded.  Overall tax receipts were €600 million, or 5.1%, behind target in the first three months of 2008.  Over half of this shortfall was accounted for by the poor performance of capital gains tax and the bulk of the remainder accounted for by weaker than anticipated VAT receipts.  Most of the other taxes were closer to what had been anticipated.  However, income tax was above target and this is a welcome indicator of the resilience of the Irish economy.  At this stage it is not expected that this tax shortfall, particularly in capital gains tax, will be recouped later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">As regards expenditure, at the end of March total voted expenditure was broadly in line with the target, at €66 million, or 0.6%, under profile.  Voted current expenditure was 1.4% below profile, while net voted capital expenditure was 4.3% above profile.  The strength of capital expenditure is due mainly to better-than-anticipated progress on a range of key capital spending projects.  This is real evidence of this Government's commitment to continued investment in economic and social development.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">While our fiscal position may have weakened from that envisaged at budget time, it is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances, including our low ratio of debt to GDP.  As is usual, my Department will continue to monitor and report regularly on progress compared with the published profiles issued at the end of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong.  This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external shocks so that our medium-term prospects are favourable.  For instance, our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area; our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments; we have a dynamic and well educated labour force; we have a pro-business, outward-looking society; and the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">The Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the national development plan remains a key priority.  As regards current day-to-day expenditure, it is crucial that the agreed budget spending limits be adhered to this year.  As I indicated at budget time, the rate of increase in current spending over the medium term must be managed carefully and kept within available resources.  This Government intends to do just that.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">People express dismay at the very rapid deterioration in the public finances.  It is hard to believe that while the Minister was in office, a surplus of €2.3 billion has turned to a predicted deficit this year of €6 billion, if we are fortunate.  This has occurred on the back of the Minister ignoring repeated warnings from bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Union to the effect that his budgetary stance was inappropriate and that building permanent spending programmes on the back of temporary revenue from the building boom was not sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">Does the Minister now believe the statements he issued and which were the core of his strategy for the public finances?  The strategy was to keep the budget in broad balance, secure a declining debt, which was to be close to zero in 2012, deliver on the national development plan in full, resulting in the expenditure of €184 billion, and make improvements to spending programmes.  Does he believe this approach, which is the core of the existing programme for Government, is still feasible?  If he does not believe it is feasible, will he outline how he intends to ensure Ministers, in making their plans, will make a realistic assessment of what is likely to be available in the coming years?  The Minister will be aware that, as recently as last week, the HSE was planning a massive hospital.  According to one Minister, there is not a red cent to deliver it.  Something is going seriously wrong and there needs to be a corrective approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">My budget stance in recent years has been appropriate.  I do not accept that the stance involved the building of permanent spending programmes with the benefits associated with improvements in economic performance, including surpluses.  Much of the surplus beyond what was predicted was put towards reducing debt, and that is why our ratio of GDP to debt was practically halved in a ten-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">On the question of the implications for the future, no one, let alone members of the Deputy's party, predicted the current economic trends before the last election.  That said, it is for the Government to manage the situation.  Obviously, I do not believe one should dismantle current spending programmes and resile from capital programmes, as suggested in the Deputy's question.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">It is clear that if the goals set out in the programmes under the national development plan are not met, prioritisation of programmes will be required.  As members of the euro area, we must adhere to the guidelines and imperatives of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Our having used our surplus in the good times for the reduction of debt enables us to be in a better position than would otherwise be possible.  We will work within the guidelines set out in the Stability and Growth Pact regarding deficit spending.  As I stated before, there were times of surplus when we were paying for capital programmes out of cash.  Borrowing modestly to invest ambitiously is the correct approach at this phase of the economic cycle.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_600">Does the Tánaiste agree that his legacy as Minister for Finance since 2004 is now very doubtful because of the events that occurred on his watch which, in many cases, were incited by him?  I refer to the slide in house prices, largely brought about by the Minister's two botched attempts to reform the stamp duty system, and to inflation, which is running at 5%, one of the highest rates in the Union.  Has the Government a strategy to deal with inflation?  The number on the live register has increased by 42,000 over the past year and, next month or the month thereafter, there will be 200,000 people registered as unemployed, many of whom will have had jobs in the construction industry, which is now in decline.  Exchequer returns are running at €600 million below profile for the first quarter of 2008.  Most important is the Minister's amazing record of turning a surplus of €1.861 billion in the first quarter of 2007 into a deficit of €354 million in the first quarter of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">Does the Minister believe there will be a need for Supplementary Estimates to redress these problems?  What does he propose to say to workers coping with an inflation rate of 5% as members of his Government step up to take a very large salary increase next September?  The increase, amounting to €38,000, is €4,000 above the average industrial wage.  As he takes up fairly awesome responsibilities on becoming Taoiseach, does the Tánaiste have a response?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_280" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_602">Yes, I do.  Once again I reject the assertions made in the Deputy's question.  The first part of her critique was a suggestion that my fiscal policy was not sufficiently loose in terms of not meeting the current programme, which the Deputy and many other Deputies in her party and the main Opposition party continue to call for.  By the same token she then refers to a change to a deficit in the current year as being a matter of doubtful legacy and suggests that I need a Supplementary Estimate.  She cannot have it both ways.  We are either spending too much or spending too little.  She cannot come with both sides of the argument.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Based on the EU harmonised index of consumer prices, the gap between average EU inflation and Irish inflation is at the smallest it has been for a number of years, with inflation at 3.5% here and 3.2% in the euro area.  Approximately 12 months ago there was a one percentage point difference, between 2.8% and 1.8%.  Even before we joined the euro, historically we had slightly higher inflation levels.  Regarding how that feeds into the pay negotiations, we need to make the point that as a result of our taxation policies and the previous pay agreements, taking account of personal, employee and other credits and tax age exemption limits, when the cost of living as measured by the CPI is taken into account, those on the average industrial wage will have seen their take-home pay rise by 41% since 1997 of which more than half is due to tax reductions in real terms.  That is a very important improvement, which I am very glad to be able to report to the House.  As we enter these negotiations — I will not negotiate here — it is clear from all our points of view that we want to enhance job security and not let further joblessness accelerate.  We need to ensure we link productivity improvements with pay increases.</p>

Does he accept the Department's forecast that tax revenue in 2010 will be at least €6.3 billion short of the figure used as the basis in the programme for Government?  Even that is optimistic as it does not take into account the deterioration this year.  Against that background how does he intend to prioritise the savings he claims now need to be made in the NDP and elsewhere?  Will it mean more closed respite beds?  We have seen the hospital in the home service cut off.  Alternatively will there be some sensible assessment of what is realistic to achieve with the resources we will have and have a proper structure for planning spending?</p>

            <p eId="para_605">I repeat my question to the Tánaiste.  Does he believe it shows good authority that at a time when workers must cope with 5% inflation, the Government is on course to take salary increases of, in some cases, €38,000, which is €4,000 in excess of the average industrial wage?  If we are in a period of greater economic difficulty — the Tánaiste talked about facing that in some coherent fashion — what moral authority or leadership is shown by the Government which is accepting increases far in excess of what people earn as an average wage?  Where is the moral authority in that stance?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_606">I will take Deputy Burton's question first.  The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the Labour Court and all the pay determination bodies that are in place have served us for, in some cases, more than 40 years in dealing with some aspects of public pay remuneration.  The pay increases are being made available to the Judiciary and senior people in Garda, Army etc. to ensure we get good, qualified people in those important positions.  As the Deputy will know, for members of the Government we have come to different arrangements, which involve a deferral of the pay increase for 12 months and then a payment over three years of the proposed increase.  It is not correct to say that that level of money will be made available to politicians this year.  We modified the recommendation significantly in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">In response to Deputy Bruton, at mid-year we will make an assessment as to the trend and we will clearly set out our position on that basis.  In March there was a bit of a pick-up in respect of some of the tax heads.  We are monitoring that situation and we will develop it.  It is clear that the reduction of €600 million in capital gains tax will not be recouped.</p>

Clearly in the event of the anticipated growth rates not being achieved we will need to adapt to that situation, otherwise we would not achieve broad budgetary balance.  The questions tabled asked what revised expenditure Estimates etc. I would provide at this stage.  I am making the point that I do not believe we should dismantle in the course of this year the expenditure targets we have set.  Obviously we will try to live within them.  However, rather than having a rapid deceleration this year, I believe my budgetary stance has been correct.  Over the period we need to consider reductions of current day-to-day expenditure more in balance with available resources in the interests——</p>

        <b>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         his views on the pattern of inflation here and its implications for public policy on pay and sectoral policy. 
        [15892/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_293" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_618">Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, reached 5% in the 12 months to March 2008.  Most of the upward pressure on prices here is due to external factors, particularly mortgage interest rate increases and rising fuel and food prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">When comparing our inflation rate with that in other EU member states we must use the EU comparable measure of inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices, which is a better measure of underlying inflation.  The harmonised index differs from the CPI in terms of coverage.  The most notable difference is the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP.  Annual HICP inflation in Ireland in the 12 months to March 2008 was 3.7%, compared with 3.5% in the euro area and 3.8% for the EU as a whole.  I apologise that I gave a different figure earlier.  The ones I have just given are correct.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">Achieving a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness.  The Government is focusing on areas it can control and is taking positive action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  I addressed the inflation impact from last year's interest rate increases in this year's budget when I increased the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time house buyers.  This, I believe, is the appropriate targeted response to such specific cost pressures.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">We are promoting greater price competition through the work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  We are also investing in public infrastructure, as evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  This will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services, which by improving the economy's efficiency should help to keep down inflation.  To the extent that inflation is externally driven it is essential that such increases are not exacerbated by generating second-round effects through inflation-chasing pay settlements, which would have a further adverse impact on Ireland's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">In the sectors that contribute to domestically generated inflation, pay and profit margin restraint are essential as well as increased competition in order to keep down price increases.  Therefore, it is essential that the upcoming pay talks under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, take account of the reality that we face.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">The word "external" seems to be creeping into most of the Tánaiste's speeches at the moment and everything is deemed to be due external factors.  Does the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance take responsibility for the fact that since 2001 Government regulated costs have gone up by 45% while at the same time manufacturing exporters have taken a 24% reduction in real income?  Does the Tánaiste accept that since 2006 Ireland has seen a loss of 30% in cost competitiveness that has resulted in goods and services exports losing 7% of their market share?</p>
            <p eId="para_624">The fact is the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance is not responsible for external factors but he is certainly responsible for domestic factors, which, particularly Government regulated costs, have been a major contributor to inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">National pay talks commenced at 2.30 p.m. today and the question I wish to ask is the same as the one I asked on 30 January.  Will the Tánaiste forgo the pay increase of €38,000, recommended by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, that he is to receive when he takes up the office of Taoiseach?  The Tánaiste yesterday said he has problems with business leaders taking exorbitant pay increases but this is hypocritical because none is more exorbitant than the pay increase he is to receive.  The Tánaiste should lead by example.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">There is nothing more hypocritical than seeking to support an independent pay determination system that has served successive Governments for 40 years and then walk away from it when a populist argument arises that suits one's case.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">Regarding Government regulated costs, we have opened up to independent regulation to promote competition and bring greater price transparency to markets that were previously Government controlled.  What the Deputy calls Government regulated costs are actually decisions made by independent regulators, set up by this House, that act independently of the Government.

            <p eId="para_638">Public service reform is essentially about improving the service provided to citizens at all levels in the most efficient and cost effective way.  Any reasonable analysis must acknowledge that the public service has come a long way since the strategic management initiative was launched over a decade ago with the objective of ensuring that the public service would make a greater contribution to national development, be a provider of services to the public and make effective use of resources.  Our public services have been expanded, improved and reformed.  There have been significant improvements in the areas of financial management, human resources management, regulatory reforms, e-Government initiatives, and customer service delivery mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">The implementation of the modernisation agenda has been, and continues to be, driven by the various partnership agreements across the public service.  The current partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and further modernisation initiatives as well as improvements in productivity right across the public service.  It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on the achievements of previous agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Towards 2016 sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the public service through the establishment of a performance verification group for each of the sectors — the Civil Service, the health, education and local authority sectors, the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces.  Under the terms of Towards 2016, payment of each of the public service pay increases is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement in regard to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement, maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Of course, any reasonable analysis will also acknowledge that while significant progress has been made over the past decade in modernising the public service, many more changes are both awaited and needed.  At a time when the Government has been investing unprecedented levels of resources in public services, problems remain — mainly with delivery on the ground and maximising return on investment.  There now needs to be a step change in the delivery of public services, with a focus on a more citizen-centred approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">This is why the Government asked the OECD to carry out a review of the Irish public service.  The Government wanted the OECD to examine rigorously the connections between the investment decisions that are being made at the Cabinet table and delivery to citizens on the ground.  The OECD was given two tasks — first, to benchmark the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries; and second, to make recommendations as to future directions for public service reform which will support the Irish Government's drive for delivery of world class services to the citizen, within existing resources, and contribute to sustainable national competitive advantage.  Put simply, the Government was asking the OECD to examine how Government priorities and decisions are translated into services and outcomes for citizens, and how these processes can be improved.  The review is intended to highlight what is working and what is not working and help us make better informed choices about developing our public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The OECD review will be published next Monday.  It will make a major contribution to the ongoing modernisation of the Irish public service.  It will provide a health check on the state of the public service.  More than that, it will provide us with a direction for the future.  It may deliver some stark messages but that is precisely what we asked the OECD to do so we must be prepared to listen to what it says.  I and my colleagues will be giving careful consideration to its recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">The Minister has said public service reform is his first priority but in the two minutes of his reply he did not offer a single specific initiative.  The Minister has been in the Cabinet for 13 years and has been responsible for the public service for four years but he has no proposal to offer the Dáil on the eve of his taking office as Taoiseach.  Would the Minister agree to an audit of quangos, as proposed by Fine Gael, so we can start to rationalise duplication that is evident?  Would he agree to changes in the linking of pay and performance?  To return to Deputy O'Donnell's point, this is at the core of disquiet at the payment of top earners in the public service.  Would the Minister agree to an efficiency programme to squeeze back the administration in Departments?  Would he agree to abandon ill-conceived elements of the decentralisation programme, which is wastefully absorbing a great deal of the time of public agencies?  Would he agree to change the archaic way in which we deal with the Estimates and the budget on one day and make a decision without any meaningful scrutiny of what they are to achieve?  Is there anything the Minister is going to change?</p>

            <p eId="para_646">I have already brought forward initiatives relating to the budget that mean the Deputy and others in committees can look at output statements and examine whether we are getting the outputs Departments set for themselves at the beginning of the year.  I have unified the budget process considerably and I would have thought there would be some acknowledgement of change in this area.  If this is to be ignored then that is fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">It is clear that as we seek to manage the public finances and understand the requirements of the situation in the short to medium term, decisions will be needed across the board on a range of issues.  We are talking about further public sector reform and the OECD report is due on Monday.  I believe it will set out a good analysis, in terms of benchmarking, of the performance of the Civil Service and public service compared to others and will suggest improvements.  In a unionised environment, on the basis of partnership, we must also recognise the need to get improvements and agreements in place that can be provided for in the context of the pay negotiations we are now embarking on.  We must get on this agenda and bring about improvements.  There have been improvements but no one is suggesting we are in a satisfactory position, given the expectations of our citizens.  The agenda will continue.</p>

I will list three simple political actions he can take.  First, he could provide that every appointment to a new board of a State agency be approved by a Dáil committee.  Second, he could provide that the Comptroller and Auditor General have a mandate to examine corporate governance in order to foresee any potential mistakes, not waiting for the milk to be spilt.  Third, will the Minister give the evaluation of public spending programmes to the Oireachtas and not to Departments?  There should be proper evaluation and scrutiny of public spending by Members.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         the lessons that can be learned from the recent developments in the property market. 
        [15895/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_312" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_655">There is a general view that the sustainable level of new housing completions is approximately 60,000 units per annum.  This estimate is based on factors such as the demographic structure of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">In the past several years, the level of output has been in excess of that level.  The Government has always been aware that activity would have to revert to more sustainable levels at some stage.  Last year, the level of completions recorded an annual decline for the first time since the early 1990s and a further decline in new house completions is expected for this year.  As such the market remains in a transition phase this year, although there is a possibility that completions could undershoot sustainable levels, given that confidence in the wider economy has been affected by international economic developments.  Given the level of activity of recent years, it is now accepted that the initial problem of inadequate supply has been rectified.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Over the medium term, however, we expect output to evolve in line with sustainable levels.  In this regard it must be remembered that on a <i>per capita</i> basis this level of output is still high by international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Regarding price developments, the latest data for February show that prices are approximately 9% below their peak levels.  When inflation is taken into account, prices in real terms are now approximately 15% lower than at their peak.  In other words, a significant part of any price adjustment that may have been necessary has already been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">This easing back of prices, combined with the measures I took at budget time on stamp duty and mortgage interest relief, makes house purchases more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers.  In terms of affordability, the April EBS-DKM affordability index shows that the proportion of net income devoted to mortgage payments for a first-time buyer working couple has decreased from 26.4% in December 2006 to 22.4% in January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The underlying demand for housing remains strong as evidenced by the strong growth in rents and supported by continuing high employment and migratory inflows.  In overall terms, while it is still not certain, there are signs, therefore, that confidence may be gradually returning to the housing market and that better value is being obtained for those wishing to buy their own home.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The main lesson from recent events is that like any market where the price of an asset increases rapidly, potential purchasers should exercise caution, which I think we are seeing happen.  We must not lose sight of the fact that one of the reasons why housing demand grew so rapidly relates to the underlying strength of the economy, seen most clearly by the strong growth in employment and incomes over the past several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">Despite all the doom and gloom that now seems to be fashionable among some commentators, we still have an economy that last year added in net terms just over 70,000 new jobs.  As regards what we must do in learning to adjust to the new property market environment, Government has been clear.  I have already mentioned the actions that I took in relation to assisting individuals wishing to enter the market.  In terms of the wider economic aspects Government is playing its part.  Our high level of public investment in capital under the NDP, is helping to offset the impact of the decline in housing output in the economy.  This has been acknowledged by the OECD as contributing to stabilising the economy in the coming years.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
            <p eId="para_664">The Minister did not answer the question as to what lessons were learned.  The sustainable level of new housing completions is 50,000 units per annum, not the 60,000 units he claims.  The budget figures are flawed as they were based on this completion figure.  The ESRI flagged to the Minister that sustainable housing levels were approximately 45,000 to 55,000 units.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The Minister referred to young people now being able to afford houses.  What about the 100,000 people who bought houses in 2005 which are now in negative equity?  They went from 58,000 in 2002 to 69,000 in 2003 to 77,000 in 2004 and 81,000 in 2005.  Still alarm bells did not go off with the Minister.  He was cheerleading the growth in house-building.  Interest rates were artificially low and these levels could not be sustained.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">The Minister was advised by the IMF in late 2005 that house prices in Ireland did not reflect economic reality.  In 2006 the Minister told everyone to build away because the economic fundamentals would sustain it.  The Minister should instead have taken corrective action.  Does he take responsibility for what has happened in the housing market?  Does he agree he should have moved earlier on stamp duty reform?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_314" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_667">I do not understand the Deputy's argument.  He argues I should have moved earlier on stamp duty reform but it was his party's main policy plank going into the general election.  This canard has been going about for 12 months.  The Deputy has just decried the fact that housing output was increasing exponentially, which is a function of the market.  The housing market and the capacity of the building industry grew because of demand.  We have been decrying the fact that output was not meeting demand requirements which was a reason why house prices were high.  Suddenly I am responsible for all this.  I am responsible, thankfully, for managing the economy and letting people get on with their business.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">The Deputy is claiming I should have intervened in the housing market by reducing stamp duty further and, as a result, increase house price inflation.  The Deputy's argument does not make sense.  An OECD report in the past month claimed my stamp duty changes were timely because the time to make an intervention is when the market is coming down.  The time is not, which was the argument I had with Fine Gael and others last year, when the market is not coming down.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_697">I refer the Deputy to my previous replies regarding the proposals published by the Commission that will lead to an agreement on the contributions of individual member states towards meeting the EU targets agreed at the 2007 spring Council.  The Commission proposes that Ireland reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 based on 2005 emissions figures and achieve an overall target of 16% of final energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020.  The proposals will take effect from 2012 after the current Kyoto arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">The proposals set out by the Commission are complex and far-reaching and require detailed analysis and discussion at EU and domestic level and negotiations on the suite of directives are currently under way.  The cost in budgetary terms and the economic impact will depend on the methods used to achieve whatever target is set and the framework agreed in the final directives.  Obviously, we will try to be as fiscally neutral as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">As we have made clear, the Government supports the overall objectives agreed and the leadership shown by the EU's ambitions in respect of climate change.  It is important that national circumstances and competitiveness impacts are considered in the context of finalising the EU's measures.  In making decisions on what policies would best achieve the final targets, we must have regard to national competitiveness and the impact of policies on different sectors.  The Government, through its actions on taxation of motor vehicles, new building regulations and the energy efficiency promotion, has begun the process of adapting the economy to a lower carbon footing.  This is a challenge for all citizens, not just the Government, and will involve choices and changes in behaviour being made to realise the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">In recent years, the Government has been acting to begin to address the challenge and we will continue to work towards reducing emissions.  These are Commission proposals and there is still some way to go before they become agreed policy.  The Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, chaired by the Taoiseach, has met a number of times to co-ordinate our negotiation approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_701">Does the Tánaiste accept that the climate change strategy published in 2000, which was designed to secure a 20% reduction, failed?  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, admitted this.  What does the Tánaiste believe are the lessons to be drawn from the fact that the then Government set itself the same EU ambition he is now praising, but in respect of which the Government did not deliver?  What implications are we to draw about the implementation of this public policy under the stewardship of the Tánaiste and his colleagues and what changes does he plan to make to ensure the same result does not recur?</p>

            <p eId="para_702">The targets are challenging and the objective is to try to meet them on the basis of avoiding a detrimental effect on economic growth, jobs and investment.  A serious behavioural change on everyone's part will be required.  We are discussing with the Commission the method to achieve the targets.  As matters stand, they would be difficult to achieve were there no flexibility.  Part of the political process of interaction between governments and the Commission is to work out the details and to determine how to achieve targets in a way that does not have a negative or more expensive effect than would otherwise be the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I agree with the Tánaiste that the target is difficult in that we will need to reduce our emissions, which are 25% above the target level.  There is a 2% annual increase in emissions despite the need for a 3% to 4% reduction.  I agreed with the Tánaiste's comments on maintaining the national development plan's investment spending, but why has the Government announced later dates for the implementation of public transport projects when the largest portion of emission increases comes from increased car ownership?  Our country has little public transport in that there are not enough buses or trains.  As the Tánaiste moves into his new role as Taoiseach, does he propose to put serious emphasis on public transport?  His colleague has set back by years the dates for the delivery of the bulk of Transport 21.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">The Luas extensions are proceeding through their various phases.  We must give credit to public service agencies when they are doing a good job on our behalf.  Surely we have not become so politically correct that we must criticise everything.  The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has been doing a good job in moving those extensions through the various phases that must be passed in our democracy.  This situation is similar to the matter of land acquisitions in other major projects and we must ensure that we can provide a means by which they can be financed.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">These are not simple, get-up-in-the-morning and dig-a-trench-type projects, rather they are complex, necessary and ambitious and we are committed to them.  Without making a political point, we all know of the historic underinvestment in this area for generations.  As I remind the House often, we first required a railway safety programme before we could engage in an investment programme.  We could not verify something was safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">Let us be logical.  The commitment to the projects remain.  We must bring them forward as quickly as possible and the methods to do so are outlined in Transport 21.  It is not a question of providing money today and having builders in tomorrow, rather it is a matter of working the consultative process with communities.  Deputy Burton is aware of the phases and what must be done even better than I am.  The costs of land acquisition and so on are considerable issues and significant moneys must be defrayed to address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">I agree we must move as quickly as possible in respect of modes of public transport.  Other cities can be examined, but this city needs it in particular and we are committed to this work.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         the basis of the State’s recalculation of public service pension provisions as published recently by his Department; and if a similar recalculation of the liability to social welfare pensions will take place. 
        [15722/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_356" as="#Tánaiste">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_718">The total accrued liability in respect of public service occupational pensions is estimated at €75 billion as of 2007.  This figure represents the present value of the expected future pension payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to date with the full liability for all future payments to current pensioners and their spouses.  The figure represents a projection of aggregate pension payments that will be spread over perhaps 70 years.  However, the more meaningful measure of public service pension costs is the actual annual outgo on pensions, which amounted to approximately €2.3 billion in 2007, or 1.3% of GDP.  This annual outgo is projected to rise to 2.6% of GDP in 2050.  The projected increase arises from the growth in public service employment in recent years and increasing longevity.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The numbers of persons covered by the accrued liability figure are approximately 300,000 serving public servants and 100,000 public service pensioners.  The liability is estimated at €45 billion in respect of serving staff and at €30 billion in respect of current pensioners.  The liability was arrived at using standard actuarial methodology.  The main factors determining the accrued liability figure are the assumed discount rate and the assumed future life expectancy of pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">With regard to social welfare pensions, the appropriate basis for assessing the liability in respect of these pensions is the projected level of future expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  The most recent projections, which were carried out in 2007, are for expenditure on social welfare pensions to rise from 3.6% of GDP in 2007 to 5.5% in 2025 and to 10.4% in 2050.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">An actuarial review of the social insurance fund as at December 2005 was published last October.  The focus of the review, which covers the period from 2006 to 2061, is the income of the fund and the contributory pensions and benefits paid from the fund.  The review showed that on present trends, the fund will move into deficit in 2009 and that the deficit would increase significantly over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The estimate of the accrued liability should not be confused with the actual cash funding that will be required in the future.  However, as indicated in the Green Paper on pensions which was published in October 2007, significant issues of sustainability will arise in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">If pensions are to grow in line with wages, total expenditure on social welfare and public service pensions would, in the absence of policy changes, rise from 5% of GDP to 13% of GDP as a result of the projected increase in the numbers qualifying for a pension.  That would be an unsustainable position.  Measures to contain the cost of the increase in public service pensions have been put in place in recent years and options for further reform are outlined in the Green Paper.  In addition, 1% of GDP is being set aside annually in the National Pensions Reserve Fund to help fund future costs.  However, the great bulk of the projected long-term increase in pension costs arises in respect of the social welfare pension and from the technical working assumption that such pensions are indexed to the growth in wages over time.  Options for addressing the sustainability issue will be considered by Government in the course of the coming months in the context of the Green Paper.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_725">The figure of €75 billion for the public service certainly is scary.  As a previous estimate suggested the social welfare liability was at least double that again, which would give a figure in the region of €230 billion.  As this is 120% of GNP, it is a substantial liability.  Does the Tánaiste share the view repeatedly expressed in reports from the EU, the IMF and others that Ireland is not planning adequately to meet the challenge of the so-called pensions time bomb?  If not, what is the thrust of his proposals to prepare Ireland more adequately for this challenge?</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Based on previous estimates, my understanding was that the figure in question was approximately €50 billion.  As it now has risen to €75 billion, what caused the sudden adjustment upwards by what appears to be 50% from the estimates I had seen in the past?  As this came as a surprise to me, how did it come about?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_727">The large size of the accrued liability figures, €75 billion, is due to it comprising the total of pension payments for many years into the future.  It will continue until the last spouse of serving staff has died, which probably will be in more than 70 years time.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I must check on where the Deputy is coming from with that figure.  I will try to get that information for him.  This is where it is coming from at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">I will answer the question in a manner that may be helpful to Deputy Bruton.  Last year, the figure of €45 billion that was mentioned in a parliamentary question only covered serving staff, while the figure of €75 billion covers both serving staff and pensioners.  The difference between the figures of €45 billion and €75 billion does not, therefore, arise from a recalculation of the amount.  There is no implication that there should be a calculation of the social welfare pension liability.  It merely is a more comprehensive figure.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_362" as="#Tánaiste">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_732">On the Deputy's policy question, Ireland has a demographic window.  Although it is not a reason to do nothing, Ireland is not at the stage reached by a number of our fellow EU member states, in which the time bomb is not only ticking but can be heard.  The issue in Ireland relates to ending the consultation on the Green Paper in May and bringing forward a White Paper as soon as possible thereafter.  This means the Government must consider this issue strategically and in a hard-headed way, which will include reinforcing the sustainability of pensions in the future and finding the mechanisms to so do.  This could involve a variation of pension age or many other options set out in the Green Paper that must be considered, as must the question of how this will be funded in the future.  While these are serious strategic questions, much good work has been done in respect of the policy formulation phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">Some people, including Deputy Bruton, would argue the consideration is taking too long.  However, because of the figures involved, the highly complex actuarial calculations that must be made and the underlying assumptions, one must check carefully what one's real options are in the short, medium and long term.  Certainly, this will be a major challenge in the future.  While we have some time before the issue hits us dead in the face, as the figures under discussion demonstrate, we must make some decisions in the short to medium term.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_734">The Tánaiste gave me a similar answer a short time ago when I asked him the same question.  Public service employees pay superannuation of approximately 6% as a contribution to the pension.  It would be interesting to ascertain how much of a contribution the superannuation contributions of current public servants' pay makes towards the costs of those who retired in the past and who still are in receipt of a pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">The National Pensions Reserve Fund has almost €19 billion available to it, which will meet some of the built-up accrued liabilities and so on in respect of pensions in the future.  Does the Tánaiste envisage increasing the Government's contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund as one way to make provisions to meet public service liabilities in the future?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_364" as="#Tánaiste">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_736">My recollection of the Act that established the National Pension Reserve Fund is that the Government is statutorily obliged to transfer at least 1% of GNP to the fund per year until 2025.  Therefore, in the event of there being room to so do in good times, the prospect of continuing with a contribution that is greater than 1% is a matter that is open to any Minister for Finance to decide on in any given year.  I recall however, that in the fund's early years, when the state of equity and other markets was such that the return on investments was low, there was a suggestion that the Government should not be putting in as much.  This demonstrates the wisdom of the provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">The purpose of this discussion is to debate how to meet future pension liabilities.  While the Government was putting that 1% of GNP aside, it was still running surpluses and ensuring it could operate a capital programme from cash.  Now however, when I try to borrow modestly to invest ambitiously, I am criticised for the deficit that might arise as a result.  It is hard to win when one goes around in a circle.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">However, to make a serious comment, it is open to a Minister for Finance to increase that allocation.  It cannot be less than 1% and I do not believe there is a view in the House that the Government should withdraw that statutory imperative in the interest of ensuring it does not fall down the priority list as it might otherwise do, were it to be a more discretionary option available to the Minister.</p>

         his views on changing the presentation of Estimates in order that they would show the extra pension liability that is being taken on by public service bodies.

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_750">The Estimates Volume provides information on voted expenditure by Departments and offices in respect of administration and programme costs.  This includes expenditure in respect of civil servants' pension costs, as provided for in Vote 7, superannuation and retired allowances, and the pension costs of other public servants, including teachers, members and former members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, among others.  This expenditure on pensions and its associated receipts are dealt with on a cash basis.  Thus accrued liabilities are not shown in the Estimates publications.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">As the Deputy is aware, there are two forms of accounting in the public service.  The accounts of Departments and Government offices are prepared on a cash basis, while local authorities and commercial State-sponsored bodies, for example, prepare their accounts on an accrual basis.  The appropriation accounts for central Departments and Government offices are required by legislation to be prepared on a cash basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">However, a working group on better financial reporting has recently been set up to review the current position with respect to the contents of notes to the appropriation accounts, which include accruals, and make recommendations for their improvement in terms of quality and relevance, to help to present a more holistic and up-to-date view.  The review will cover long-term liabilities, including pensions at the aggregate level.  This information will be included in the finance accounts.</p>

            <p eId="para_753">Substantial liabilities are incurred by the State when people are recruited into a new service, but this never shows up in any assessment.  We should build that liability into decisions to recruit so that if, for example, a 15% or 20% pension liability is implied, the agency making the decision recognises the cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">Similarly, while I do not want to return to the political arena, when we decide to give increases of, for example, €30,000 to senior public servants or Ministers, that represents a pension increase of €16,000 to €18,000.  The actuarial cost of purchasing that in the marketplace is massive.  I do not believe any serious thought is given to the true costs of these packages when they are blithely approved.  The increases have significant implications for the Exchequer and, regardless of whether the decisions are correct, they at least need to be clear and transparent.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">Actuarial advice was taken to that effect and it was set out in much greater detail and transparency than was the case for the initial report.  We can agree or disagree with the recommendations but we should fairly characterise the professionals involved and the work they did.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">I accept the point about the costs which are incurred when permanent and pensionable posts are created.  How to move away from a cash basis is perhaps a matter on which the working group on better financial reporting could report to me.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with the ups and downs of that at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">Civil servants' superannuation and their contributions to the cost of their pensions are accounted for on a cash basis so, in a sense, superannuation payments by current civil servants contribute to the pensions of retired staff.  Can we be given information on the extent to which current payments meet the cost of current pensioners?</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Will the Tánaiste consider establishing an office of a national actuary, perhaps within the National Treasury Management Agency?  Similar offices have been established in many other countries to regularly publish this important information so that people are informed on pensions.  Many people do not realise that civil servants pay towards the cost of their pensions.  They think superannuation is notional.  The NTMA also manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, if it employed a national actuary, information on different parts of the public service could be independently published on an annual basis.  It is not possible at present, for example, to get separate figures for the health services or the Garda.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">I do not want to dismiss the Deputy's suggestion but actuarial advice is available on an independent basis to the Pensions Board, which has a statutory remit on advising the Government on pensions policy generally and is one of the vehicles through which we are proceeding with the pension policy review.  It is a matter of examining that and deciding whether a case can be made.  There is also a requirement on many agencies and State boards when submitting their annual accounts to report problems that arise in respect of pensions or where the sustainability of finances has to be addressed in the event of some major pension liability.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">The figures are alarming to say the least.  By 2050, 10.41% of GNP will be spent on public sector pensions.  I ask the Tánaiste to publish a White Paper as a matter of urgency because, apart from the State sector, a significant number of lower paid people in the private sector have no pension provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">Current pensioners comprise €30 billion of the €75 billion liability.  I presume that ratio will be increasingly skewed towards retirees.  It is imperative that we bring proposals to deal with pensions, particular given that the public sector payments will be in deficit by 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">Clearly, the demographics will change in coming decades.  Some years ago we made assumptions based on certain population changes which did not prove correct.  The assumptions may be robust in the short term but the further ahead one predicts, the lower the certainty of accuracy.  The demographics ratio between those of working age and pensioners will obviously deteriorate, from 4:1 at present to predictions of 2:1 in 30 years time, if the population of people of a certain age does not expand.  We have to be somewhat circumspect, while in no way denying the importance of the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">Improving one's pension provisions requires deferring present income to future consumption.  That is an important aspect because the reason one should have a good pension is for the better chance it offers of spreading consumption over one's lifetime in a way that continues to contribute to demand and revenue.  While everyone agrees with the objectives of pension policy, reaching agreement on the means of meeting them, which often requires the deferral of prospective income in the short term for a longer term consumption pattern, is the problem.  It is difficult to sell the idea of waiting for a rainy day because it is human instinct to believe one will not be around by then.  However, that does not detract from the validity of the argument.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Deputy O'Donnell noted that few people on low incomes have supplementary pensions, the simple reason for which is they do not have the disposable income which would allow them to consider the option.</p>

        <b>Deputy Emmet Stagg</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         the source of concerns that certain charities may be claiming tax reliefs on false donations; the estimate of the likely extent of such a problem; if there are proposals under consideration by him to amend legislation for charitable tax status; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [15617/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_389" as="#Tánaiste">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_772">The provisions of section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 govern the operation of the scheme for tax relief on donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies.  The administration of those provisions is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.  To avail of the donations scheme a charity must be specifically authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of the scheme and that authorisation falls to be renewed every five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The donations scheme was introduced in 2001 and a substantial number of authorisations under the scheme were issued in the years immediately following its introduction.  Therefore, many of these are now due for renewal and, as part of the routine renewal process, the Revenue Commissioners are carrying out a programme of reviews to ensure that charities which have been authorised under the donations scheme are continuing to comply with the terms of their authorisations.  This review involves contacting these charities and seeking their accounts and other relevant information.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">There has been some media speculation recently that this exercise was triggered by fears that charity organisations were defrauding the State.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have no evidence that there are significant or widespread problems in the sector.  The level of review activity is in part a product of the level of authorisations coming up for renewal at the same time but it is also an ongoing feature of Revenue's compliance monitoring activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">There are no proposals under consideration to amend the legislation governing charitable tax status, although the Charities Bill, which completed Committee Stage recently, provides for the appointment of a new charities regulator and sets out a framework for better regulation of charities.  However, the Revenue Commissioners will retain responsibility for the administration of the donations scheme and charitable tax exemption.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_390">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_776">There are reports that Revenue is concerned that bogus claims are being made by charities which seek to recover tax on apparent donations, which are not donations, certainly not donations to what the ordinary person would understand to be a good and proper charity.  The difficulty is that the Charities Bill has been kicked around by the Government since 1997 and is still on Report Stage.  It has had a journey through so many Departments, it must be suffering an identity crisis.  As it is still on Report Stage, there is no legislation in Ireland governing charities.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">Irish people are renowned for being extraordinarily generous to charities, both in Ireland and overseas, but there are serious concerns that the Revenue scheme is open to abuse.  Is the Minister not concerned that if bogus claims are made for recovery of tax by bogus operators, it brings all charitable activity in Ireland into disrepute, including that by organisations which work hard and do excellent work here and abroad?  Will the Minister elaborate on the trawl by the Revenue Commissioners?  There are thousands of registered charities.  How many are involved?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_778">As I said in my primary reply, the review is part of the ongoing monitoring of the authorisations, many of which are coming up for renewal at the same time.  It was suggested in the media that this was a result of a fundamental concern by Revenue that matters were not as they should be.  The tenor and content of my reply is to the effect that Revenue is not indicating that this is the case.  Instead, for the reasons I have given, Revenue is indicating that these are matters it must deal with but that it does not believe there is a serious or widespread problem, or a problem such as was perhaps communicated through the media because these reviews were taking place.  People assumed the worst when, as I understand it, that should not be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">I do not know the number of authorisations Revenue is examining at present but I will try to get that information for the Deputy.  Some 2,040 bodies have been approved under the donation scheme since its introduction in 2001.  Last year, the number of PAYE donors was more than 81,000 and €25.3 million was refunded under the donation scheme to charities and approved bodies.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_392">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_780">There are many reports to the effect that, for example, in regard to private schools it is possible for parents to construct schemes of donations within a charitable framework which effectively means that those schools have a benefit over and beyond that which an ordinary State-run school might have.  When does the Tánaiste expect that the charities legislation will be implemented?  I would be grateful if he could supply to me by written reply some of the figures to which he has just referred, or any other details he has.</p>

            <p eId="para_781">I will try to get whatever further information I can for the Deputy in terms of what numbers are being examined at present.  It is not correct to suggest there is a preference with respect to types of schools.  Since 2001 all primary and post-primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed and approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of the donations scheme.  As the Deputy knows, there are approximately 4,000 such schools in the State.  The matter of whether they are fee-paying schools is not a consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_790">The senior speech and language therapist assigned to Rowlagh health centre resigned in November 2007.  At the time, the HSE had in place what it referred to as a recruitment pause — in other words, there was an embargo on recruitment for positions that fell vacant — and it did not allow the vacant speech and language therapist position to be filled.  This embargo was lifted on 31 December but the HSE determined that it would not fill any posts that became vacant while the embargo was in place.  The post is still vacant and there are no plans by the HSE to fill it.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">I received a reply from the HSE, when my question was referred to it recently, which stated that the only way it could fill the position was if another post became vacant and it suppressed that post.  In other words, some other post would have to be deliberately left unfilled for this vacant speech and language therapist position to be filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">With regard to the impact of this decision, the therapist provided therapy to children in the north Clondalkin area.  Children from six primary schools in the area were on waiting lists to see her.  Before she resigned, there was a waiting list of 18 months for the service but now there is no service.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, may know, there are Early Start programmes in the schools in this area because they are designated as disadvantaged.  The children are from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Their parents are not well off.  The purpose of the Early Start programme introduced by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, was to provided targeted intervention to identify the needs of these children at an early stage in their education.  They have been part of the Early Start programme but the speech therapy they have been identified as requiring will now not be provided to them.  After all the investment in the Early Start programme and its success, the basic services are not being provided to these pupils.  I have raised the issue previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">One of the notions being peddled is that there are not enough speech therapists.  I made inquiries today and thanks to a Government initiative there are now 100 graduates in speech therapy each year because the additional 75 places were being filled.  Most of those people will not be able to get work in Ireland, however, because of the embargo on filling speech therapist positions in the health service and in the public service.  After all the money invested in their education, they are now in the position where they cannot get jobs here and important speech therapist vacancies that are needed are not being filled.  That is ridiculous.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">I do not know what the Minister of State will say, on behalf of the Minister, in her reply but when I raised this matter previously I was told the matter was one for the HSE and that it is responsible for human resources and filling posts but the HSE is implementing these cutbacks in positions because of the Government's requirement to keep within budget.  As is the case with the cuts in respite care services, it is the most vulnerable who are affected.  On this occasion children in disadvantaged areas who have been identified as being in need of speech therapy are being affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">It is not the HSE that has the ultimate responsibility to care for the vulnerable in terms of the delivery of our health services.  It is the Minister for Health and Children and she should intervene to ensure the HSE does not leave these vital speech therapist positions unfilled.  The HSE is opting for the easy targets in terms of its cutbacks but the Minister is turning a blind eye to what it is doing.  The people affected are in her constituency and she should intervene and ensure the HSE fills this position as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">I will take this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">I thank Deputy Tuffy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the current situation regarding speech and language therapy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">I wish to advise the House that the recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan.  The purpose of that break-even plan was to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the HSE's 2007 national service plan.  The pause did not involve random job cuts but did mean the recruitment of staff to approved positions was delayed.  I understand the HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect frontline services and that close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31 December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1 January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of the circular issued by the HSE in early January.  That circular sets out the HSE employment control framework for 2008 and is aimed at ensuring that health services are delivered in accordance with the provisions of the 2008 national service plan and within the funding provided by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">My colleague, Deputy Harney, are I are conscious of the effect the non-filling of this post has on clients in the catchment area of the health centre in question, which I understand is called the Rowlagh Health Centre.  As the House will be aware, however, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  The filling of posts, therefore, is an issue for decision by local management having regard to service priorities and allocated budgets.  The Health Service Executive has advised that it has a policy of prioritising the filling of frontline posts to enable the delivery of services to patients and clients.  The HSE has also advised that the situation in Rowlagh Health Centre will continue to be kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">The House may wish to note that arising from the budget day funding package approved by Government for 2008, an additional 1,050 new posts have been approved for the health services.  It is anticipated that a number of these posts will be therapy professionals.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">Leopardstown Park Hospital has a ward of 21 beds that, unexpectedly and arbitrarily, are to be closed from 5 May.  A number of constituents in my constituency have been informed that the bookings they made for persons they are caring for who are to be admitted in the months of May, June or July, for whom respite care had been confirmed, have been cancelled.

The HSE says it is surprised the respite beds have been closed without its authority.  The hospital says the HSE was told all about the hospital's difficulties in March.  At some stage the HSE was saying it knew nothing about this while at another stage it was saying it would get into negotiations with the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">I have a simple view.  We are seeking to encourage relations and spouses to care for their elderly relations and spouses who are unwell in the home.  They are performing a service which saves huge resources to this State and leaves hospital and nursing home beds vacant to others.  They are entitled to the basic recognition that respite care will be made available to them.  No one should be treated in a manner in which respite care already booked and confirmed is cancelled less than three weeks before it was to be utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">I do not want to get the same reply as that given to my colleague.  I am heartily sick of being told, and I quote from the previous reply, that "as the House will be aware, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004", and that the Minister has no dealings in the matter.  It is the Government that sets policy.  It is the Minister with responsibility for the elderly who has a political obligation and apparently a ministerial function to ensure the elderly in our community are treated in a decent and humane manner and have available to them the services to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">I call on the senior Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Hoctor, to immediately intervene and ensure the respite care previously confirmed and made available to persons for the months of May, June and July or other months in the summer is restored.  I ask that action be taken to ensure that ongoing respite care is provided in Leopardstown Park Hospital.  It is an outrage and a scandal that people should be treated in this manner and that a crucial and important service, which for some people is their only lifeline to sanity and relaxation for one week in the 52 weeks of the year, should be withdrawn in the manner this service has been withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">I do not want to be told that the Minister has no function in the matter and that the HSE should deal with it.  The HSE was created by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  It is maintained in its current form by the current Minister and it is an unaccountable body spending over €15 billion of taxpayers' money.  I do not accept that no matter how incompetent or poor the service or how inhumane the decision made that it should never be answerable.  Ultimately and politically, the Minister and Department of Health and Children are answerable to this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">I am hoping to be told this service will be restored.  I have some optimism there is a possibility because of the two bodies — the hospital and the HSE — talking to each other, that some action will be taken to at least meet the commitments already in existence.  I hope I will be told the service will be fully restored and this problem is being immediately addressed and will be resolved by the weekend.</p>

            <p eId="para_810">I reiterate that I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputy Shatter for raising the issue as it provides me with the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to services for older people generally, and in particular to the important area of developing day and respite care.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Government policy is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The Government's objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  In the 2006 and 2007 budgets, more than €400 million was provided to enhance service developments across the sector, of which just over €190 million was for community-based services over the two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">The 2008 budget provided an additional €135 million, bringing the total spend over the last three years to €540 million, including €22 million for the development of community services for older people.  These measures have been designed to both enhance existing services put in place by the Government and also widen the range of services available to older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">In this context, more than €16 million has been provided in the past three years for new day and respite care services.  The recent budget will allow an additional 1,245 clients nationally to avail of new respite places and brings the total projected day-care provision to approximately 21,300 places by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">As the Deputy is aware, the Health Act 2004 provides the HSE with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">As a statutory body, the provision of these services, including the delivery of services by agreement with voluntary and community organisations, is a matter for the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">Leopardstown Park Hospital provides care for approximately 200 patients in south County Dublin.  The majority of the beds are long-stay beds for older people and there are also respite beds and dedicated beds for patients of Alzheimer's disease and welfare-home type beds on the campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The hospital receives in excess of €12 million annually through the HSE to pay the costs of its services.  As the Deputy is aware, the allocation of resources is a matter for the executive, in accordance with the overall priorities for particular services as set out in its service plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">Discussions around the 2008 service level agreement are at an advanced stage with the Dublin south-east local health office of the HSE, which is the main link for the hospital into the HSE.  In this context, the executive has advised it has been discussing with the CEO a deficit in the hospital budget which has accumulated over several years.  The HSE has further advised it will be necessary for the hospital to break even financially in line with HSE plans.  This is no different from any other agency funded through the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">In the course of these discussions, the executive proposed a solution and plan to the CEO and board of Leopardstown to eliminate the deficit over a two-year period.  The HSE advised that the focus of this plan was that the impact on services would be kept to the absolute minimum necessary to achieve break-even.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The board decided in a meeting on 6 March not to adopt the plan and to instead address budgetary issues by the closure of 11 respite and ten long-term beds with effect from 1 May 2008.  It is important to note it was the hospital which made this decision rather than the Health Service Executive.  When this decision was communicated to the executive, it sought an urgent meeting with the hospital board.  It is understood this meeting will take place on Friday, 25 April 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_409">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_826">I raised this matter on 14 October 2003.  At that time, St. Brendan's national school in Blennerville was closed because of rat infestation.  In the course of my contribution I pointed out that the school was on the INTO list of schools in urgent need of replacement.  Unfortunately, very little has happened since.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The school is now about 75 years old.  In September 2007, the board of management of the school was informed that the file for the proposed new eight-classroom project had been referred to the schools building section of the Department from the schools planning section for the purpose of appointing a design team to the project and initiating architectural planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">They were also advised that the advertisement seeking design team consultants for the proposed building project was entered that day, 26 September 2007, on the public procurement portal site, with a closing date for the pre-qualification stage of the completion of Friday, 26 October 2007 at noon.  At that stage, the Department would conduct the selection competition and the process would continue to the second stage, award of the design contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">There has been no communication with the school since.  Despite a number of letters from the board of management, there has been no response from either the Minister or her Department.  I understand school authorities were informed by telephone last January that there would be a substantial delay in advancing the project to the next stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">I point out that the school will face a crisis in 2009 as it will have enrolment for the next appointment in September 2008.  That will be more than 173 pupils.  It had two new appointments in September 2007, one mainstream due to development school status, and one resource due to an increase in the number of special needs children.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The school will not have a classroom to accommodate the extra teacher and class in September 2009.  Currently, the school has one main building with four classrooms.  Two measure 17 ft. by 17 ft. and two measure 19 ft. by 19ft.  The rest of the accommodation consists of two temporary buildings, which are mainstream classrooms.  One is owned and the other is rented.  There is one prefab of 20 ft. by 10 ft. for learning support and one 40 ft. by 12 ft., which is divided.  One section serves as an office staff room a store room, the other section is a resource room.  This is just unacceptable in this day and age.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The board of management cannot put in another temporary classroom as it would take away a precious play area, which is currently inadequate for the enrolment of 157.  I know this yard very well and there is very little space to move.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">The application for a new school began in 1996 and the board of management received a letter in April 2000 approving the new school.  In 2008, the teachers and pupils are still working in cramped and unsuitable conditions.  The teachers, parents and board of management of the school are very concerned and angry that the new school project seems to have been shelved.  They feel betrayed by the Minister and her Department, as they were specifically told, before the last election, that the project was a top priority, and money and resources were available to complete it as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">They were told this by the Minister when she visited the school in the company of the press and the Fianna Fáil candidates running in the last election.  They need the new school to progress and they feel they have been strung along for far too long, with projects which started long after them now completed.  They still have nothing and worse, no notification of when they can expect progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">I appeal to the Minister of State present to take these views on board; it is unfortunate we do not have the Minister for Education and Science here or a Minister of State from that Department.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Education and Science the message that the current position is not acceptable.  Construction of a new school has been signalled for some time and the project should be one of the main priorities of the Department at this stage.  I understand that this matter was referred to by three speakers during last night's Seanad debate on school buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">A major public meeting is due to be held in Tralee on Monday night next and the people attending will be very angry.  I hope the Minister of State can provide good news which I can convey to them.  I will give her full credit at the meeting to which I refer if she can provide such news.</p>

            <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_837">I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter because it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the provision of a new school building for the school to which he refers at Blennerville, Tralee, County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The school in question is a co-educational facility with a current enrolment of 157 pupils, which represents a 26% increase in the past five years.  It has a staffing level of a principal, five mainstream teachers and two learning support teachers.  The school authority has applied for large-scale capital funding for a new building and the Department has acquired a site for the provision of an eight classroom generic repeat design building.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">As outlined to the House on many occasions, all applications for large-scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria by the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science.  Under these criteria, each application is assigned a band rating that reflects the type and urgency of works required.  A band 2 rating has been assigned to the Blennerville project.  This is the second highest rating possible and reflects the fact that the school has existing accommodation but that this needs to be replaced.  This approach ensures openness and transparency in respect of how capital funding is allocated to projects and that funding is targeted at the projects that are most in need.  It also ensures that there is an orderly flow of projects through the school building and modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The next step for the project is the appointment of a design team.  This will be considered on an ongoing basis consistent with the band rating assigned to the project in the context of competing priorities from higher band rated projects and the funding available.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I assure him that the Minister and her Department are committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Blennerville national school at the earliest possible date.</p>

            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_843">I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue, namely, the introduction of a sale of flats scheme.  Such a scheme must be introduced because it would be an extremely important social inclusion measure.  When the sale of houses scheme for council tenants, there were huge improvements in estates throughout the country, particularly those in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">The difficulty is that many people live in substandard accommodation in Dublin City Council flat complexes.  Fire safety in many of these complexes is not adequate.  There was a fire recently in one of the top floor flats at the Beech Hill complex in Donnybrook in my constituency and firefighters could not gain access from the rear of the building.  That is not acceptable.  The fire regulations must be changed so that people can raise their children in an atmosphere of security and safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">The standard of electric wiring in many flats is not acceptable and needs to be upgraded as a matter of urgency.  The position in respect of drainage is similar, with sewerage pipes running through people's flats and, in many cases, their kitchens.  Flats are regularly flooded as a result of old and rusting pipes.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Those who live on the top floor of flat complexes experience continual problems with leaks because many of their roofs need repair.  These roofs are often repaired but within months the problem returns and there is a need for further repair.  This is an expensive process.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">Bedrooms in flats are often tiny and this accentuates the difficulty that arises in the context of overcrowding.  Even if a sale of flats scheme is introduced, most of those who live in council flats in Dublin will not be able to avail of it because their homes are in such a substandard condition.  It would be wrong for the council to sell substandard flats to tenants who are eager to buy.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">Many people have stated that there is a need for a sale of flats scheme and that it must be introduced as quickly as possible.  However, we must get it right and ensure that we do not sell second-hand goods to tenants.  It will be possible for those flats that are refurbished to be sold under the scheme when it is finally introduced.  However, those which are not refurbished will not be sold.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">The redevelopment of flat complexes is ongoing.  I refer here to the complexes at Charlemont Street and York Street. Other redevelopment projects are already in the pipeline.  However, this is not sufficient.  We need a redevelopment scheme in respect of which a clear timeframe for commencing and completing works will be set down.  The flat complexes at Beech Hill, Mercer House, located a stone's throw from the Dáil, Glover's Court, Bishop Street, Ringsend, Irishtown, Rathmines and Pearse Street are in a substandard condition and should be redeveloped.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">Tenants deserve to live in modern and safe accommodation.  The Government must ensure that flat complexes are redeveloped to such a degree that their tenants will be able to avail of a sale of flats scheme, were it to be introduced.  The residents of most of the flat complexes to which I refer would not be in a position to avail of such a scheme.  People have invested a great deal of money in their flats and, like those who own the houses in which they live, they want to pass them on to their family members.  They should be entitled to do so and I ask the Minister of State to ensure the scheme to which I refer is introduced as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_851">I thank Deputy Chris Andrews for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I am happy to set out for the information of the House, the work being undertaken to extend the opportunity for home ownership to more social housing tenants in a way that protects the interests of tenant purchasers, continuing tenants and local authorities alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The Government announced its intention of introducing a scheme for the sale of local authority apartments under certain conditions in Housing Policy Framework — Building Sustainable Communities, published in December 2005.  This commitment was reiterated in Delivering Homes. Sustaining Communities, a statement on housing policy published in February 2007.  Furthermore, the Agreed Programme for Government published in June 2007 indicated that the Government will "expand the paths to home ownership to assist the maximum number of people in gaining a stake in their own home".</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Proposals for a tenant purchase scheme for apartments were included in the General Scheme of the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and approved by Government for drafting in December 2006.  These proposals take account of the difficulties experienced with previous attempts to introduce such a scheme in areas such as the management of apartment complexes, insurance, the cost of maintenance and the transfer of legal title.  They also reflect consideration of proposals submitted by Dublin City Council in 2004 for selling its apartments to tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The proposals are based on the long-standing arrangements in the private sector for the ownership and management of multi-unit residential developments.  The transition from a rented social housing apartment complex to a mixed tenure of privately-owned and social-rented accommodation adds an extra dimension to the legal and practical problems that can arise in private apartment complexes.  In conjunction with the Attorney General's office, progress is being made in identifying and dealing with the complex issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">The tenant purchase of apartments is one of a range of reform measures included in the Bill, which is scheduled for publication in the current parliamentary session.  The new legislation will give effect to the programme of social housing reforms outlined in <i>Delivering Homes. Sustaining Communities</i>, which is aimed at improving services and their delivery.  The reform programme includes new provisions on the assessment of social housing needs, updating local authority powers to deal with anti-social behaviour, expanding and providing a more developed legislative basis for the rental accommodation scheme and a statutory basis for housing action plans.  As well as updating and expanding the existing tenant purchase path to home ownership for social housing tenants, the Bill will provide for a new incremental purchase scheme whereby households can start acquiring, by degrees, ownership of certain new local authority houses from their first day of occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is looking forward to a thorough examination in this House of all the proposals in the Bill, which will be recognised as a major contribution to reform of the social housing sector.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_859">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 54 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 already allows the Standards in Public Office Commission to carry out investigations on its own initiative, where it considers it appropriate to do so, on breaches of the provisions of the Ethics legislation, by persons in the Commission's area of responsibility, and as provided for by the legislation.  The Deputies will, of course, be aware that issues concerning a non-office-holding member of the Oireachtas would, in the first instance, be a matter for the Select Committee on Member's Interests of the relevant House.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">As regards the other changes to the Ethics legislation recommended by the Standards Commission in its last Annual Report, I do not propose to amend the definition of the term "specified act" used in the legislation, or to legislate for a complaint concerning failure to abide by certain defined ethical standards.  The existing definition of "specified act" aims to strike a fair balance, and there are already Codes of Conduct to guide the ethical behaviour of Oireachtas members, office-holders and civil servants in their day-to-day business and these codes can be taken into account by the Standards Commission in an investigation of an alleged breach of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">As regards inquiry officers, again I have informed the House previously that I have no plans to amend the law to enable the Standards Commission to appoint an inquiry officer without having received a complaint. It is reasonable that a complaint to the Standards Commission should be required to commence the inquiry process, which, in itself, can carry serious consequences for the person who is to be the subject of it.  Numerous categories of persons, including members of the public and any public representative, are entitled to make a complaint against the persons and office holders against whom complaints can be made to the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The other Standards Commission recommendations are technical.  One of them — about the furnishing of ‘nil' statements — is already provided for in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  Another concerns statutory declarations of tax compliance under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, and relates to extending the period within which proceedings can be taken in relation to false or misleading declarations.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, which is before this House, extends that period in relation to statutory declarations generally, including those required under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  I aim to circulate amendments to the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, which amends the Ethics legislation and has been passed by the Seanad, to cater for the remainder of the Standards Commission's recommendations in advance of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill when it is being taken in the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_867">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 80 and 95 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">The Programme for Government states that the Government will continue to move ahead with decentralisation and ensure that no public servant is obliged to accept decentralisation against their wishes and that promotion opportunities remain available. I have no plans to review the programme.  A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was submitted to me and published on 8th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the civil service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">From the announcement of the Programme in December 2003, the focus has been on detailed planning and organisation of the property, staffing and business aspects.  The DIG has considered it essential that all organisations take the necessary time to prepare this groundwork well in order to ensure effective implementation of a programme of this scale and complexity. The focus of the Group has not been on how speedily the programme can be achieved but how well. It is important to remember that the programme is not just about moving public services. It fundamentally impacts on the staff in those organisations, on their career choices and their expectations.  Over 11,000 civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, over 6,000 or 55% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility (CAF) remains open and continues to receive applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">To date, decentralising organisations have a presence in 34 towns.  Approximately four thousand staff have been assigned to decentralising posts and over 2,200 of these are currently in their new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  Taking account of both posts moved and assignments approximately 50% of the civil service posts have already moved or have staff in place with a commitment to move.  Property or sites have been acquired or are well advanced in a total of 38 locations.  In addition, the OPW have been very efficient in securing suitable advance or temporary accommodation in over 20 locations to facilitate the early phasing of the transfer of business units.  The October DIG report, which can be accessed at http://www.decentralisation.gov.ie, provides an update of the OPW timeframes for the expected completion of permanent accommodation. The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis and is keeping these timeframes under review based on its experience to date in relation to property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">I remain confident that the public service will deliver this programme in a considered, sensible and sensitive manner. The Government is anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed and in that context Secretaries General of decentralising Departments have been asked to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the DIG to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to permanent accommodation or advance accommodation. The DIG is currently examining the position in relation to progressing the relocation of the State Agencies, with a view to identifying where early progress can be made.</p>

The Estimates provide for total gross expenditure of just under €62 billion made up of approximately €53 billion current expenditure and €9 billion capital expenditure. These are the settled spending allocations with which all Government Departments and Agencies must comply.  The end-March Exchequer returns showed that expenditure was broadly on target for the first three months of 2008. The question of bringing forward revised spending plans does not arise, and I have no plans to do so.</p>

In my view this approach combined with the submission of Annual Output Statements to the Select Committees results in an improvement in the quality of the information available to the Dáil in considering the Estimates and facilitates better accountability and information on what is being achieved for the moneys approved by the Dáil.  Separately, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General provides Value for Money Reports to the Committee of Public Accounts for consideration as part of his role in examining whether State bodies are using their resources economically and efficiently and have mechanisms in place to   evaluate the effectiveness of their operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_877">In response to Priority Questions 1 and 2, I have already set out the fiscal position at end-March. In this regard, I would remind you again of the Government's policy.  While our fiscal position may have weakened from that envisaged at Budget time, the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio. Also, the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external ‘shocks' so that our medium term prospects are favourable.  For instance:</p>
            <p eId="para_878">our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area;</p>
            <p eId="para_879">our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments;</p>
            <p eId="para_880">we have a dynamic and well educated labour force;</p>
            <p eId="para_881">we have a pro-business outward looking society;</p>
            <p eId="para_882">the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">I wish to stress that the Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the National Development Plan remains a key priority. As regards current day-to-day expenditure, it is crucial that the agreed budget spending limits are adhered to this year. As I indicated at Budget time, the rate of increase in current spending over the medium term must be managed carefully and kept within available resources. This Government intends to do just that.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">As I have previously indicated, the responsibility for undertaking project appraisals rests in the first instance with the individual Departments and Agencies. They are prepared to facilitate and inform the internal decision making process.  It has not been the practice to publish these appraisals as they generally contain commercially sensitive information, the publication of which could be prejudicial to the State's capacity to get best value for money in procurement of capital projects. In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate to require that details of appraisals of NDP projects be published as a matter of course.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">The efficiency review referred to by the OECD is the one I announced in Budget 2008.  The nature and terms of reference are set out in the Budget Booklet at Page B.24.  In accordance with these terms of reference, all Government Departments and Offices were required to examine all administrative spending within their area, including spending by state bodies under their aegis, and to report back to my Department by March 2008 with specific proposals to maximise administrative savings in their area.  The results of this exercise would then be reviewed within the Department of Finance, and the savings identified would be used in reducing the cost of the existing level of services for 2009 and subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">In setting out the parameters of the Efficiency Review, I laid down no requirements as to the persons who should be involved in conducting the examinations within each Department, nor as to the specific terms of reference that would guide the examination exercise in each case, as these are matters to be determined by the Head of Department or Office in each case.  However, in the Summary of 2008 Budget Measures, I indicated that particular areas of interest included possible inefficiencies due to the multiplicity of Boards and Agencies;  the need for better sharing of certain services;  and efficiencies in management, travel and consumables in general.  I also indicated that the measures identified would not jeopardise the maintenance of front-line services.  The reviews have now been received and my Department is examining what further action is required.  The outcomes of this exercise will be taken into account in the Budget for 2009, at which point the results of the exercise will be published.</p>

            <p eId="para_890">Section 110 of the Finance Act 2007 made provision for a charge to stamp duty where license agreements and other such arrangements are used when land is purchased for development without conveyance or transfer.  The provision ensured that these arrangements will incur a Stamp Duty charge where a landowner receives a payment amounting to 25% or more of the market value or consideration concerned.  Section 110 is subject to a commencement order on the basis that it would be prudent to consider the state of the housing and property market before the provision is put into place.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">For this reason, I commissioned an independent study of the potential effects that such a provision may have on the market.  The Report is available for download on my Department's website at http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/reports/2008/S110Report.pdf.  As these transactions, under current law, do not involve a liability to Stamp Duty, there is no requirement to present any documentation to the Revenue Commissioners for stamping and there is therefore no specific data on which to accurately estimate any revenue gains from commencing the provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">The Report also makes the point that there are no official data sources on the value of development land sales; therefore, it gives an indicative estimate of the total value of the development land market in 2006 at c. €7bn to €8bn.  Based on a technical assumption that 40% of land transactions use these arrangements, the Report estimated a potential revenue gain in 2006 of c. €251m if the provisions had been in place at that time.  However, this estimate is based on the historic levels of activity in 2006 and is not indicative of the revenue gain that would occur following commencement of the provisions at a later date.  A more realistic figure for the revenue accruing from the provisions is in the order of €50m per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">It should be noted, however, that the Report recommended that, on balance the section should not be commenced at this time. In this regard, it indicates that Section 110 would have led to a rise in land prices, with a knock-on increase in house prices, especially for first-time buyers, and possibly risked exacerbating the down-turn in the property market.  In addition, the Report highlighted that Section 110 would also have raised the cost to the State of PPP projects because of increased land prices.  The commencement of Section 110 of the Finance Act 2007 is kept under constant review and any further consideration of this issue has to take into account the prevailing circumstances in the housing and property markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">As the Deputy is aware, the social partners meet today to open negotiations on a new pay agreement under Towards 2016. The Government's objective in entering these talks is to achieve a sustainable agreement compatible with improving competitiveness and productivity.  Pay developments in the period immediately ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and be accompanied by improvements in productivity. Any agreement will have to take account of the economic and budgetary realities. Therefore, pay increases must be kept at a level which will not undermine our competitive position relative to our main trading partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">It is crucial that wage expectations are kept in line with the rapidly changing economic environment in which we are operating. Over the last number of years, wage increases have exceeded productivity growth, with a resulting loss in competitiveness. Regaining market share will require an approach to wage determination which takes greater account of productivity developments as well as labour cost developments in our major trading partners.  As a small and open economy, our priority must be to ensure that our economy is in a position to take advantage of the global recovery when it emerges.  This will require a renewed focus on competitiveness.  As regards public sector pay, the public service pay bill remains the biggest single element in public expenditure accounting for around half of all current expenditure. Each 1% increase in the public service pay bill costs around €185 million. The development of public service pay costs must ensure that resources allocated to public service pay do not cause a shortfall of resources for other key priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">One of the core strengths of Social Partnership has been its strong foundation in realism regarding the nature of the competitive challenge for Ireland. It is important that all those in the public service improve their productivity and continue to deliver the best possible quality services to the public. The structures we have put in place in the public service pay agreements are an important mechanism to help ensure that we achieve that goal. We need to build on that base in what is agreed in the current negotiations.  The national partnership agreements have served us well over the last decade and I would hope that this well tested approach can once again be relied upon in helping us meet the emerging challenges we now have to face as a small open economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">I have noted the IMF report and it is important to be aware that in relation to the Irish housing market there are some significant variables of specific relevance to Ireland such as household formation and flows of immigration that were not included in the technical model.  While this is acknowledged by the IMF it does mean that their analysis is not a wholly representative picture of the Irish housing market.  As I said in response to a priority question earlier today, house prices have fallen when inflation is taken into account.  In other words we have already seen a significant price reduction, which has resulted in a fall in house prices of nearly 15% in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The price adjustment in the housing market alluded to above, when combined with the measures I took at Budget time on stamp duty and mortgage relief, is making house purchases more affordable for first time buyers.  The April EBS/DKM affordability index shows that the proportion of net income devoted to mortgage payments for a first time buyer working couple has decreased from 26.4% in December 2006 to 22.4% in January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The rate of growth of mortgages has cooled substantially over the past year.  Annual year-on-year growth for February fell to 12.3%, a 14 year low, from 22.9% a year previously.  Both the Central Bank and I have highlighted the need for borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic and financial environment, including the impact of higher interest rates.  I fully support the vigilance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the issue of personal credit and mortgage debt and in reminding both borrowers and lenders of the need for responsible behaviour.  Finally, as I said earlier the underlying demand for housing is solid and as more confidence returns to the market over the coming months the fact that there is now better value will impact on the market.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">The Deputy may wish to note that while the outlook is for weaker, although still positive, employment growth this year, Ireland's unemployment rate is expected to remain low by international standards, below the European average.  In terms of the housing market, affordability in Ireland is supported at the current time by such factors as continued income growth, interest rates that are relatively low in historic terms and increases in mortgage interest relief available in particular to first-time buyers.  Improvements in affordability are being achieved, reflecting the adjustment in the housing market and changes that I have made in my December 2007 Budget in relation to Stamp Duty and Mortgage Interest Relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Financial Regulator (FR), speaking to the 30 January meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, pointed out that there are no indicators emerging yet that there is a significant increase in mortgage default levels or arrear levels.  The Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland pointed out in a recent speech that the level of non-performing loans remains low by historical standards.  The FR's Consumer Protection Code (CPC) requires regulated entities to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the CPC sets out the requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  The CEO, also at the 30 January Joint Committee meeting, pointed out that the FR considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">As Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.  Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders.  I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.  Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Furthermore, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme — which is part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme administered on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs by the Community Welfare Services of the Health Service Executive — provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  While I will remain alert and vigilant to any emerging issues, I do not, given the extent of the arrangements already in place, consider the establishment of a contingency fund to be either necessary or appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">The 2008 expenditure allocation for the Exchequer social welfare Jobseekers Allowance scheme is almost €1,020 million.  I am aware of the recent upward pressure on the Live Register and this will, depending on developments over the remainder of the year, have implications for expenditure on this scheme.  However, Jobseekers Allowance is only one of a number of demand led schemes that are funded from the Vote of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The expenditure trend on the Jobseekers Allowance scheme will be closely monitored during the course of the year, but it is still too early to say that such pressure will pose significant difficulties for the Social and Family Affairs Vote as a whole.  Expenditure on the Jobseekers Benefit scheme is met from the Social Insurance Fund and does not fall on the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">Regarding income tax receipts, at the end of the first quarter income tax receipts were up 5% compared to the same period last year.  Despite the Live Register pressure, this is a welcome indicator of the resilience of the Irish economy and my Department will continue to closely monitor overall tax performance over the coming months as a clearer trend emerges.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">The arrangements for appointments to the boards of State bodies are normally set out in the legislation establishing the bodies in question and are designed to ensure the efficient management of the organisation.  Appointments to the boards are generally made by the Minister with responsibility for the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In making appointments, Ministers seek to ensure that the people appointed bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences to the body.  Ministers also take account of any specific legislative or policy requirements such as those contained in the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Acts or the Government's policy on gender balance on the boards of State bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">Where appropriate, Ministers may also consider representation from the different strands of society such as the business community, consumers, trades unions or the other social partners.  Government and Ministerial appointments are published in the Iris Oifigiúil as soon as can be arranged following the appointment. The Government Secretariat arranges for publication of appointments made by the Government, while it is the responsibility of individual Departments to publish appointments made by a Minister.  I am generally happy that the present arrangements, which follow the practice of previous Governments, work well and that people with the required skills and experience are appointed to State boards.  Nevertheless I recognise that it might be useful to give some thought to involving committees of the House in appointments to some boards.  This is an issue that some of my colleagues have been looking at in relation to boards under their remit.</p>

Budget 2008 announced all new spending and taxation measures in a single, unified way and was a significant reform providing for greater transparency. The costs associated with the decisions made were set out at Budget time.  Taking account of the overall macroeconomic and fiscal environment, further instalments will be made in the subsequent Budgets over the lifetime of this Government.</p>

This process must be managed carefully so as not to jeopardise our longer term future and this is what I am doing.  I would remind the Deputy that the Programme for Government is a five year programme. As such, the commitment must be judged over the full five years of this Government, taking account of the health of the public finances.

            <p eId="para_922">The OECD report contained a generally positive assessment of the Irish economy.  While recognising the challenges facing Ireland in the period ahead, the report acknowledges the remarkable performance of the Irish economy over the past decade. Of particular note is that the OECD report states that the economic fundamentals — including a skilled workforce, a flexible labour market, moderate taxation, a business-friendly regulatory environment and a sound fiscal position — all remain strong. In addition, the OECD's assessment of Irish fiscal plans is that they remain prudent overall.  In commenting on the fiscal position, the OECD notes that the rate of public spending needs to slow and that it is important not to lock-in expensive spending commitments. I have already indicated on a number of occasions that spending growth has to moderate and grow in line with the growth of our resources over the medium term. Consequently, I regard the OECD's assessment as an appropriate one in the present economic climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_924">At Budget time, an economic growth rate of 3.0 per cent in GDP terms was forecast.  However, a number of risks to the economic forecasts were identified, including the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the US, the possibility of adverse exchange rate movements, the possibility that financial market difficulties could persist for longer than assumed and the possibility of a sharper contraction in new house building.  It now appears that some of these risks have materialised and in this regard other economic commentators that produce forecasts on a more frequent basis have revised their forecasts for growth in 2008 downwards.  The market consensus is now for GDP growth of around 2.25% this year, compared to a consensus of about 3.25% at Budget time. More modest growth would, of course, have implications for the evolution of the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">At end-March, there was a tax shortfall of €600 million and I indicated that I did notexpect that it would be recouped. While the fiscal position has weakened somewhat from that envisaged at Budget time, it is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio. Also, the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external ‘shocks' so that our medium term prospects are favourable.  For instance:</p>
            <p eId="para_926">our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area;</p>

As provided in the Programme for Government, this Government's priority is to keep low earners out of the standard rate band and average earners out of the higher band.

            <p eId="para_934">The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has since 1989 operated a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions. The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by ensuring that credit unions are financially and administratively sound and provides for savings protection for each individual credit union member.  It is important to note that under the SPS regime no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares and deposits and no credit union has become insolvent. The SPS has only been called upon in a very limited number of cases and it has never been necessary to make savings protection payments to individual credit union members. The Deputy may wish to note the role of sound prudential supervision of credit unions by the Registrar of Credit Unions under the Credit Union Act 1997 in ensuring the continuing solvency and liquidity of credit unions and the safeguarding of the interests of credit union savers.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides for approval of savings protection schemes by the Registrar of Credit Unions as the delegate of the Regulatory Authority. Once an approved scheme is in place under the Act it would be incumbent on all credit unions to participate. This highlights the importance of ensuring that an approved savings protection arrangement is consistent with the requirements of the credit union movement as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">In line with changes in the regulatory environment for financial services generally the need for modernisation of the credit union SPS has become evident over time. Proposals for reform of the SPS were the subject of discussions in 2007 between the Registrar and ILCU resulting in the submission of detailed proposals for the reform of SPS in November 2007. I have written to the Chairman of the Financial Regulator confirming my view that an approved savings protection scheme for all credit unions should be in place as soon as possible. In this respect the Chairman of the Financial Regulator has advised me that it is the intention of the Financial Regulator to deal with outstanding issues on SPS and to urgently find a solution to this issue. I am further advised by the Registrar of Credit Unions that he has arranged to hold further discussions with ILCU on reform of the savings protection arrangements for credit unions in an effort to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</p>

The Government approved some 90 formal Value for Money Reviews to be carried out for the period 2006-2008.

            <p eId="para_955">The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Grant-in-Aid payment to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) contained five recommendations, all of which are in the process of being implemented. The recommendations are intended to improve the overall value for money for the grant-in-aid. Among other things, they are directed at relating funding to outputs; benchmarking the ESRI with comparable institutes in other EU member states, and periodically reviewing the policy relevance of the Institute's research. The level of the grant in aid has not changed significantly as a result of the review.  The Information Society Fund terminated at the end of 2005 in line with its intended lifespan. As a result, an annual allocation for the fund is no longer required. The Fund was focussed on initiatives in the areas of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The focus of the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) Review was largely on policy aspects relating to the payment of the grant-in-aid and several of the recommendations should contribute to the efficiency of the organisation and reduce not only the direct Exchequer grant, but also the payments for services made to the organisation by both the public and private sector. One of the recommendations of this Review was that responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland should move to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. This change took effect from 1st January, 2008. The DCENR will be better placed to comment on further progress achieved as the other recommendations of the Review are implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">With regard to the reviews of Procurement Management within the Department, Construction Procurement Reform Initiative (formerly Procurement Management Reform) and the Civil Service Child care Initiative, it is not possible to anticipate the consequences of these reports until their findings are finalised, considered and implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">The first review Revenue's Data Capture Outsourcing Programme was completed in October 2006.  The report contained six recommendations, three of which have been implemented.  These relate to the promotion of e-facilities for returns filing and the ongoing review and research of form design and simplification.  There is an ongoing project in Revenue to simplify and improve all PAYE forms.  Post-implementation reviews have been carried out on existing contracts. The implementation of the other recommendations will only be possible should Revenue initiate further data outsourcing projects and will be addressed at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The second review Information Technology External Resources Expenditure was published in March 2008.  The report contained eleven key recommendations relating primarily to:</p>
            <p eId="para_966">the use of more formal project and programme management methodologies and best practice techniques;</p>
            <p eId="para_967">expansion of internal resources and skills; and</p>

            <p eId="para_969">The majority of the key recommendations of this review and the best practice techniques proposed have already been implemented or are very significantly advanced. The remaining best practice techniques proposed by the VFM Review will be assessed to determine their suitability for and relevance to Revenue's ICT programme. The implementation of the recommendations will deliver improved effectiveness in the delivery of ICT programme objectives and optimise the value obtained from this expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">The role and functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) in dealing with consumer complaints complements that of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers of financial services as a whole. During the passage of the FSO legislation through the Oireachtas in 2004 it was stated, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the Ombudsman's remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and it is the responsibility of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The relevant legislation provides for co-operation between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on general issues relating to the protection of consumers. A Memorandum of Understanding has been concluded between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator to ensure the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  An issue drawing attention to a general breach affecting consumers can be referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Financial Regulator. Such issues can then be examined by the Financial Regulator to consider if there are any suspected breaches of the relevant regulatory requirements including the Consumer Protection Code. The Financial Regulator can, as part of its administrative sanctions regime, seek to mediate or take regulatory action in relation to a firm including an order to make refunds to a firm's customers where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">I have asked the FSO and the Financial Regulator to review their current co-operation arrangements to ensure that these work smoothly where a finding of the FSO in an individual case may have implications for a broader group of customers of a financial services firm. The Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator have responded in a joint submission to the Department that the Memorandum of Understanding is operating as intended and that co-operation between both offices is highly satisfactory and allows issues to evolve. They have also advised that where a pricing error occurs after 1 July 2007 the provider is required under the Consumer Protection Code to speedily, efficiently and fairly correct such an error.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">The Deputy may be aware that a High Court judgement in October 2007 confirmed that the Financial Services Ombudsman's power of direction, except in relation to a change in general practice, may only relate to an individual claimant and does not extend to payment of compensation for other consumers in relation to similar conduct of the financial service provider. I have asked the Advisory Forum on Financial Legislation to review the implications of this High Court decision in conjunction with the joint submission of the Financial Regulator and the FSO.</p>

            <p eId="para_1311">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33, 36 and 67 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">I want to assure the House that the Government's position on our corporate tax regime is unambiguous. Corporate taxation matters are and will remain within the competence of Member States. Our corporation tax system is protected, in an EU context, by the principle of unanimity in taxation matters. This principle is underpinned in the Reform Treaty, so that the Treaty will not undermine our national discretions in this regard in any way.  Recently, Ms. Christine Lagarde, French Minister for Finance made the opening speech at the Brussels Tax Forum which had as its theme "Taxation Policy: Enhancing Competitiveness and Growth in a European Way".  Ms. Lagarde spoke about the themes for the forthcoming French presidency which includes taxation matters.  In relation to the CCCTB she acknowledged the difficulties with the proposition, reflecting the reality that there is no consensus among Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">It is important to remember that no political decisions or even discussions have taken place among EU Finance Ministers on this project. The Commission is carrying out technical work on various aspects of a CCCTB but has not yet made any formal proposal.  While France supports the CCCTB concept I know that they are keenly aware that a significant number of Member States have serious reservations about the project, and I believe they will deal with any Commission proposal in a way that fully respects the views of all Member States.  As there has not been a formal proposal, it is very difficult to assess the impact of a CCCTB on Ireland and the EU overall. The Irish position on the CCCTB is well known and I will continue to highlight the difficulties I believe such a proposal could cause for individual Member States and overall EU competitiveness. There is, I know, increasing scepticism among Member States as the Commission's technical work continues.</p>

         his views on whether the failure to address the fact that for the past five years economic growth was driven by domestic consumption rather than by exports is partly to blame for the current economic situation and that if steps had been taken to address this matter at an early stage the prospects for the Irish economy would be better than they now are.

            <p eId="para_1315">In recent years, domestic demand was the main driver of growth, in part due to very high levels of residential construction.  The high level of completions in this sector over the period was necessary in order to ensure more modest house price inflation by achieving a greater balance between housing demand and supply.  I would also point out that higher levels of completions also resulted in substantial employment growth over the period.  Notwithstanding these developments, the Government recognises that, in a small open economy such as Ireland's, it is imperative that sustainable export growth is achieved.  Such growth can only be realised through ensuring that our economy remains competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">In this regard, this Government has been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, a number of policies which will underpin the future competitiveness and growth of our economy, including a firm commitment to responsible budgetary policies.  This Government has implemented policies which are aimed at rewarding both work and enterprise through maintaining a low tax burden on capital and labour.  Furthermore, the continued roll-out of the National Development Plan (NDP) remains key.  The investment in capital provided for in the NDP is helping to eliminate infrastructural bottlenecks which hinder economic efficiency and is also enhancing productivity.</p>

Overall tax receipts were around €600 million, or 5.1 per cent behind target in the first three months of 2008. Over half of this shortfall is due to the poor performance of Capital Gains Tax which reflects the more adverse conditions in equity and property markets.  At this stage it is not expected that this tax shortfall, particularly in CGT, will be recouped later in the year. It is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio.  Finally, my Department will continue to closely monitor overall tax performance over the coming months as a clearer trend emerges.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1320">As the Deputy is aware, there are two forms of accounting in the public service. The accounts of Government Departments and Offices are prepared on a cash basis while Local Authorities and Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, for example, prepare their accounts on an accrual basis which includes the charging of depreciation.  The Appropriation Accounts for central Government Departments and Offices are required under legislation to be prepared on a cash basis. In a cash accounting environment, the value of a capital resource is recognised and charged fully to the account in the year of acquisition. In addition, in cash-based accounts, the planning for the cost of replacement of capital items is done on a requirements basis and submitted for Vote approval. It should be noted that cash accounting does not provide the scope to build up a fund of money for future spends either current or capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">Under the Management Information Framework (MIF) Project new accruals-based accounting systems were rolled out across the civil service over the last four years.  It is now possible for all Departments and Offices to capture more detailed information for the better management of spending programmes and to improve the scope of financial reporting.  Drawing on the information available under the MIF, an information note in the Appropriation Account reports on the capital assets position and presents the position of Net Assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation).  In addition, all Departments and Offices must now present an Annual Output Statement to Dáil Éireann which sets out the target outputs of Departments and Agencies for the resources provided and reports progress on performance as compared with targets for the following year.  These initiatives significantly improve the efficiency of resource use in Departments and offices.</p>

         if he has assessed the level of home repossessions which is occurring; and if there are implications for public policy.

            <p eId="para_1325">The Deputy will appreciate that reports relating to court proceedings for property repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the fact that not all of the proceedings relate to residential property.  It should also be noted that even where such orders are secured some are not enforced.  The number of orders granted by the High Court is a very small proportion — representing less than 0.3% — of the number of new mortgages issued in the same year.  As such, care needs to be exercised in drawing any particular conclusions regarding the property market or public policy overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">In terms of the housing market, affordability in Ireland is supported at the current time by such factors as continued income growth, interest rates that are relatively low in historic terms and increases in mortgage interest relief available in particular to first-time buyers.  Improvements in affordability are being achieved, reflecting the adjustment in the housing market and changes that I have made in my December 2007 Budget in relation to Stamp Duty and Mortgage Interest Relief.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Financial Regulator (FR), speaking to the 30 January 2008 meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, pointed out that there are no indicators emerging as yet that there is a significant increase in default levels or arrears levels.  The Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland pointed out in a recent speech that the level of non-performing loans remains low by historical standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">The FR's Consumer Protection Code (CPC) requires regulated entities to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the CPC sets out the requirement that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  The CEO, also at the 30 January Joint Committee meeting, pointed out that the FR considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">As the Deputy will be aware, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2007 introduced a system of regulation of non-deposit taking lenders, including specialist or so-called sub-prime lenders, with a view to extending both the Consumer Protection Code and the Minimum Competency Requirements to their activities.  This system is currently being rolled out by the Financial Regulator.  As Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders.  I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.  Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt. MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Furthermore, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme — which is part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme administered on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs by the Community Welfare Services of the Health Service Executive — provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  I will remain alert and vigilant to any emerging issues, in particular where there are any implications for public policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1336">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 81, 90, 91 and 107 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">The Irish financial system has been positively assessed by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in its Financial Stability Report and more recently by the OECD. The OECD's Economic Survey of Ireland, 2008 points out that Irish banks entered the current period of international financial turmoil in a very strong position and that they, therefore, have considerable capacity to respond to unexpected developments. The OECD noted that sustained economic growth has ensured that Irish banks are well positioned to deal with recent market developments. The OECD welcomed the findings that Irish banks have little exposure to the sub-prime market, hedge funds and the private equity sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">I would remind Deputies that the most important safeguard of financial stability is the existence and effective operation of the financial regulatory and supervisory regime. In Ireland the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland integrates within a single institutional structure both the supervision of individual financial firms by the Financial Regulator and the monitoring of overall financial stability, which is the independent responsibility of the Governor of the Central Bank. The roles are complementary and this structure yields significant advantages in terms of monitoring and maintaining financial stability in ensuring seamless, effective and timely co-ordination of these two key functions. It is important to emphasise that the framework for financial regulation here is shaped by a detailed and comprehensive template which applies across the EU and that our approach has been positively assessed by both the IMF and OECD.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">EU Finance Ministers have adopted an extensive road map of actions incorporating a work programme running to the end of 2008 aimed at putting in place a comprehensive response to developments in financial markets. This road map includes reviewing along with the EU's international partners how to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of ratings agencies. Ecofin Ministers and Central Bank Governors have recently agreed an extended Memorandum of Understanding on financial stability contingency planning between financial supervisors, central banks and finance ministries that incorporates common principles and practical guidelines for cross-border cooperation. This EU framework facilitates timely information exchange and sharing of views and assessments between my Department and the CBFSAI on issues related to financial stability.</p>

In this Commentary, lower levels of new housing output and the deterioration in the international environment are the main factors weighing on growth this year.  The market consensus is now for GDP growth of around 2.25 per cent for 2008. However, there is currently a wide range of forecasts for economic developments this year, as in fact over a two week period a number of different forecasts including the ESRI's were published with forecasts ranging from 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent for GDP growth this year.  What is clear is that while growth will be lower than in the recent past, it will be a higher rate of growth than can be expected in many of our trading partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1349">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that enquiries relating to non-residence are a feature of their risk-based audit programmes.  The procedures adopted in relation to validating a claim to non-residence status depend on the circumstances in each case.  The methods used to verify claims to non-residence include a range of tests, which may include the examination of ATM transactions and credit card statements, and an intelligence dimension which, for obvious reasons, they do not publicise.  In relation to work carried out as part of its risk-based audit programmes, Revenue have advised me that it has no reason to conclude that there are failures to comply with the rules governing non-resident status.  I can confirm that the Revenue Commissioners have previously advised me that the number of individuals who show they are not domiciled in the State on their 2005 return of income is 4,955.  In addition, the 2005 returns show 2,239 spouses as non-domicile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Domicile is a concept of general law.  In the case of married couples, the domicile of each spouse is determined by their own particular set of circumstances.  There are three different types of domicile: domicile of origin; domicile of choice and domicile of dependency.  Under Irish law, every individual is regarded as acquiring a domicile of origin. This is the domicile of his/her father subject to certain exceptions. This domicile of origin will remain until such time as a new domicile of choice is acquired. In order to change domicile and acquire a new domicile of choice, an individual must have reached the age of majority, they must move to a new country with the intention of making a new home there and they have to abandon the idea of ever returning to live in Ireland.  It should be noted that it is not unusual for spouses to have different domiciles and, in this regard, the level of immigration to Ireland in recent years may be a relevant factor.  Domicile of dependency is now generally only relevant to minors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1352">Available data on services are, by their very nature, somewhat limited.  However, in relation to the available indicators these suggest more modest activity in the services sector this year.  I would point out, however, that exports of services have been very strong in recent years, rising by over 14 per cent last year.  Employment in tradeable services tends to be in the higher value-added, knowledge-intensive sectors, where pay levels are relatively high.  In other words, we are moving further along the value-added curve and this is a positive development.</p>

This will bring the total numbers employed in the health service to 112, 560 by the end of 2008.

            <p eId="para_1359">Revenue is not in a position to estimate the total number of Irish resident taxpayers in possession of foreign properties.  As regards ensuring tax compliance by such persons I am advised by Revenue that one of the key objectives of their Offshore Assets Group is to identify Irish residents holding offshore properties in particular where these properties have been funded by undeclared profits or gains.  So far, the Group has identified more than 2,000 Irish owners of foreign properties.  This has been achieved by using methodologies such as, exchange of information arrangements with other tax administrations; monitoring of advertisements and websites; accessing land registries in other jurisdictions where this is possible and using the information provided by other jurisdictions under the EU Savings Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">All of these cases identified are referred for examination to ensure that there is no Irish tax evasion involved either in relation to the source of the purchase money, any income generated from renting the property or any chargeable gain arising from disposal of the property.  I gave Revenue additional powers in the Finance Act this year to obtain information from agents who manage properties abroad or receive rents in respect of properties abroad.  It is hoped that this will also contribute to the identification of non-payment of tax on foreign property income but the impact of this measure will not be known until the first returns are submitted.</p>

Every effort will continue to be made to pursue policies that seek to contain costs to business and manufacturing industry to the greatest extent possible. In this regard, my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who retains responsibility for the development of enterprise policy, will consider appropriate measures to address key issues raised by the Report.  It should be remembered that Ireland has always had one of the lowest Corporation Tax rates on companies and our social security costs for employers are far less than in many EU member states.

            <p eId="para_1366">With effect from 1 January 2002, credit unions were required to apply DIRT on certain deposits held by members. Where recipients are in receipt of income that attracts DIRT they have no further tax liabilities in relation to this income as the DIRT liability is the final tax liability. The issue of the correct operation of the DIRT provisions by credit unions is a risk factor which the Revenue Commissioners consider in determining whether to initiate an enquiry or conduct an audit on any credit union. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is currently no industry-wide audit of the credit unions on the non-operation of DIRT at source.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">In addition to enquiring about the compliance with DIRT requirements by credit unions, the Deputy may also be enquiring about the enabling provisions contained in section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as inserted by section 125 of the Finance Act 2006) which authorises the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations requiring financial institutions, including credit unions, to make an annual return to Revenue of payments made to customers resident in the State.  This provision applies regardless of whether or not DIRT applies in a particular case.  Regulations can be made for any period not earlier than 1 January 2005.  Officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had detailed consultations with the various financial institutions on the proposed implementation of these regulations and the outcome of these discussions is now being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1369">In the wake of dislocation in global financial markets from mid-2007 onwards, the Ecofin Council of 9 October 2007 requested the Commission and the EU Financial Services Committee (FSC) to consider possible enhancements of the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) and to report back to the Council by mid-2008. Since then, discussions on DGS have taken place in the FSC, the EU Economic and Finance Committee (EFC) and at Ecofin. These discussions are ongoing and acknowledge the crucial role that DGS can play in maintaining confidence in the banking system. They also recognise that DGS are but one of the elements of the financial safety net.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">Ireland is participating in the EU review of DGS launched by EU Finance Ministers last October.  On the basis of the outcome of the EU review, I will, of course, consider any specific changes required in the Irish DGS to ensure that savers in Ireland benefit from safeguards in line with EU best practice.  I would remind the Deputy that, as I have mentioned in response to previous similar questions, the first and most robust line of defence for depositors must be a well-managed system of prudential regulation and supervision so as to try to minimise the risk that a DGS needs to be activated. Recent assessments by bodies such as the IMF have confirmed that the Irish regime for financial regulation complies with best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that consistent with EU requirements, the Irish Deposit Protection Scheme guarantees 90% of deposits up to a limit of €22,222, which means the maximum possible payout is €20,000. The Irish DGS is maintained by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1373">The European Commission's assessment, based on the update of Ireland's stability programme which was published with Budget 2008, represents a reasonable view of the Irish economy. While it refers to the challenges of a "transition to a period of lower economic growth, mainly linked to a return to more sustainable activity in the housing sector", it also acknowledges the overall strong position of the public finances and that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain sound.  The main recommendations in the related Council Opinion of 4 March 2008 are that Ireland should:</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">maintain firm control over public expenditures in order to keep the public finances in broad balance;</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">implement further pension reforms to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances in view of the significant projected increase in age-related expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">Ireland is in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements and the Government is committed to respecting the terms of the pact as the economy adjusts to a period of slower growth.  The Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the National Development Plan remains a key priority. It will help boost the productive capacity of the economy and lay the foundations for future growth.  In relation to the area of pensions, the recent Green Paper discusses a range of possible measures and the Government is committed to put in place a pensions system which is financially, economically and socially sustainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1380">Inflation, as measured by the average annual change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), reached 5.0 per cent in the twelve months to March 2008. However, it is important that we acknowledge that the fact that price levels in Ireland are now on average 20 per cent above levels in other euro area countries is an indicator of the slippage in recent years in our competitiveness. Most of this upward pressure is due to external factors, particularly mortgage interest rate increases and rising fuel and food prices.  When comparing our inflation rate to that in other EU Member States we must use the EU comparable measure of inflation the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) — which is a better measure of underlying inflation. The HICP differs from the CPI in terms of coverage, the most notable difference being the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">Annual HICP inflation in Ireland in the twelve months to March 2008 was 3.7 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent in the euro area and 3.8 per cent for the EU as a whole.  Achieving a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. The Government is focusing on areas it can control and taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. We are promoting greater price competition through the work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. We are also investing in public infrastructure — as evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007 — 2013.  This will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and, which by improving the economy's efficiency, should help to keep down inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">To the extent that inflation is externally-driven it is essential that such increases are not exacerbated by generating second-round effects through inflation-chasing pay settlements, which would have a further adverse impact on Ireland's competitiveness.  In the sectors that contribute to domestically-generated inflation, pay and profit margin restraint are essential as well as increased competition so as to keep down price increases.  Therefore is it essential that the upcoming pay talks under the Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, take account of the reality that we face.</p>

            <p eId="para_1384">In the Finance Act 2008 I increased from €250 to €300 the duty payable in respect of an off-licence for the retail sale of alcohol. In the normal course, many off-licence premises have three separate licences for the sale of alcohol, covering spirits, beer and wine, which, between them, allow the sale of all kinds of alcohol.  The effect of the increase is, therefore, to increase the annual licensing cost for an off-licence from €750 to €900.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government Alcohol Advisory Group, established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined, among other matters, the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences; and the manner and conditions of sale of alcohol products in such outlets. The Group invited submissions from the public and reported to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 31 March 2008.

The Deputy's question presumably arises as a result of a recent newspaper headline stating "Department of Finance wanted stamp duty report put on hold".  The document giving rise to this article was released under a Freedom of Information request and it related to a briefing for the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners attendance at the Public Accounts Committee in December 2007.  In this regard, the briefing reflected the fact that the report had been recently received and in that context "Finance have advised that they would prefer not to highlight the findings of the report or its possible treatment (i.e. commencement or non-commencement of Section 110) at this stage until the Report and its implications have been fully considered."  There was never any question of the findings in the Goodbody Economic Consultants Report being withheld.

            <p eId="para_1395">The provisional annual surplus of the Social Insurance Fund in 2007 was €581.7 million and the provisional accumulated surplus of the Fund at the end of 2007 was €3,630.8 million.  The annual surplus of the Fund in 2008 is estimated to be €548.1 million and the accumulated surplus at the end of 2008 is estimated to be €4,178.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The investment of the accumulated surplus of the Fund has been delegated, subject to guidelines, to the National Treasury Management Agency.  In line with those guidelines, the accumulated surplus is invested in euro deposits and Government bonds.  These guidelines and investment policy reflect a strong liquidity preference in the investment of the accumulated surplus, as funds must be available to meet the benefit and other liabilities of the Fund as required.  That prudent approach is also dictated by the projections contained in the recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which indicated that, having regard to stated assumptions, the accumulated surplus will run down in the early years of the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost of social welfare pensions and public service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055.  Under the provisions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund and it has discretionary authority to determine investment strategy in accordance with the Reserve Fund's statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.  In formulating its investment strategy, the Commission has regard to, inter alia, the Reserve Fund's long-term investment horizon and strong cash flow, due to the annual Exchequer contribution of 1% of GNP.  The Commission's asset allocation strategy, therefore, is founded on the premise that real assets, such as equities, will outperform financial assets such as bonds over the Reserve Fund's long term investment horizon.  Therefore, the differences in investment horizons and capacity between the Social Insurance Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund are reflected in their respective investment strategies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1399">As I have indicated in response to earlier Parliamentary Questions on the fiscal and economic situation, the fiscal position at end-March was some €600 million behind where we had expected. Furthermore, I have indicated that at this stage it is not expected that this tax shortfall, particularly in CGT, will be recouped later in the year.  In terms of new house completions, the indications are now suggesting that housing output may be below that anticipated at Budget time. Some of this weakness is evidenced in the performance of taxes in the first quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">While our fiscal position may have weakened from that envisaged at Budget time, it is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio. Also, the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external ‘shocks' so that our medium term prospects are favourable.  For instance:</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area;</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments;</p>

            <p eId="para_1405">the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">I wish to stress that the Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the National Development Plan remains a key priority. As regards current day-to-day expenditure, it is crucial that the agreed budget spending limits are adhered to this year. As I indicated at Budget time, the rate of increase in current spending over the medium term must be managed carefully and kept within available resources. This Government intends to do just that and the issue of a supplementary Budget does not arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1408">In general terms, the OECD has long considered that the encouragement of home ownership diverts capital away from more productive uses within the economy.  Bearing this is in mind, the main thrust of the OECD's survey on Ireland in relation to housing was that we should gradually reduce the bias towards home ownership in the tax system by either starting to phase out mortgage interest tax relief or by introducing a property or capital gains tax on owner-occupied housing.  In this regard, I'd point out that it is the long standing belief held by policy makers in Ireland that home ownership is desirable and that is why successive governments have implemented measures to support home ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">I broadly agree with the views of the OECD regarding the need to raise the growth rate of productivity. However, it is important to remember that productivity is still rising but that the rate of increase has slowed somewhat in recent years. This mainly reflects the rising importance of the labour-intensive new house building sector. In this regard, there are a number of policies already in place to help achieve improvements in productivity. The prioritisation of resources towards infrastructure and education under the National Development Plan is perhaps the best example.  Other important policies in place to support productivity include the maintenance of a flexible economy with a low burden of tax on capital and labour.  Finally, I'd remind the Deputy that in overall terms, the OECD gave a generally positive assessment of the Irish economy and acknowledged its strong fundamentals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1411">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no solid basis on which to estimate the numbers entitled to refunds of DIRT in excess of those who annually seek and are granted tax refunds.  A refund of deposit interest retention tax is provided for in very limited circumstances only, namely, an individual who is not liable or fully liable to income tax and is over 65 years of age at some time during the tax year or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental/physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself. (Bodies qualifying for ‘charitable' status and companies are also entitled to refund of DIRT). The taxpayer must advise Revenue that he or she meets the legislative requirements and the amount of the retention tax suffered. In addition, it should be noted that with deposit interest rates being relatively low in recent years, the quantum of the interest earned and tax retained would be very small in many cases and it may be considered uneconomic to reclaim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">The number of people claiming refunds and the amounts of the refunds for the years 2002-2007 is summarised in the table.  This may not include some taxpayers whose DIRT refunds were processed as part of a self-assessment tax return.</p>

            <p eId="para_1435">In Section 34 of the Finance Act 2007, I introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT-exempt savings accounts subject to two conditions: (1) the account holder must be aged 65 years of age or over or be permanently incapacitated; and (2) their total income must not exceed the relevant exemption threshold.  Provisional figures show that in 2007 some 47,218 such accounts were operated. These figures will increase as the remaining financial institutions file returns for 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Revenue widely publicised these changes when they were made in 2007. An Information Leaflet (DE1) giving comprehensive information for qualifying taxpayers on how to have interest credited to their savings accounts without deduction of DIRT was made available at Revenue offices. Information on DIRT exemption was also included on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. Application forms and information leaflets were also made available at most financial institutions. Revenue also arranged for an information leaflet to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of state and other pensions. Approximately 100,000 leaflets were issued in this way. Information on the DIRT exemption was also included in Age Action's monthly magazine "Ageing Matters" in June 2007.  During 2008, Revenue will continue to examine a range of channels or means to target the over 65s and it plans to publicise the facility, including: posters in local offices; contact with representative bodies; financial institutions; other Government Departments and agencies; and relevant advertising.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1439">I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 78 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by an average 4.9 per cent in 2007, and has risen by 5.0 per cent in the twelve months to March 2008.  Of the 4.9 per cent figure in 2007, 2.2 per cent was contributed by increased mortgage interest repayments. Including the impact of mortgage rate increases in the CPI not only masks the underlying inflation rate but also highlights the short-term impact of interest rate increases which are designed to bring down inflation. A better measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index is the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which excludes, among other things, mortgage interest. The HICP is also the measure used by the European Union and European Central Bank to compare inflation across member states. The average increase in the HICP in 2007 was 2.8 per cent, and 3.7 per cent in the twelve months to March 2008, marginally below the average for the EU 27 as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The main contributions to the annual increase of 5.0 per cent in CPI over the 12 months to March 2008, in order of importance were: housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels contributing just over 2.0 per cent; food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing almost 1.1 per cent; and transport contributing 0.75 per cent. Therefore out of the twelve categories comprising the basket of goods that make up the CPI, three contributed almost 80 per cent of the total inflation in the twelve months to March 2008.  The main driving forces behind these figures are increased mortgage repayments and rising food and fuel costs. Mortgage rates are largely set by the ECB and the price levels of food and fuel are set on global markets, and are therefore largely outside domestic control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">That is not to say that I have not sought to support measures that seek to curb inflationary tendencies in our domestic economy, and to pursue policies intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on the less well off.  Over the past ten years or so I and my predecessor have ensured that those depending on social welfare have achieved substantial real improvements in their living standards. Furthermore, in my Budget 2008 statement I made clear that the first priority of this Government was to ensure that the poor and vulnerable in society are protected. This priority still stands.  In addition, pay increases under partnership agreements combined with tax reductions have resulted in the disposable income of the average Irish worker being the second highest in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">The best way to protect the real incomes of ordinary workers is to pursue policies that sustain competitiveness and employment. We must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. Seeking to achieve low inflation, pursuing an appropriate incomes policy and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are essential. Doing these will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential.  If we can ensure that pay increases reflect productivity growth, rather than unwisely trying to compensate ourselves for externally-generated inflation, our economy can grow at a pace which will continue to deliver real increases in living standards for those on social welfare and for all workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1445">The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established on 2 April 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of Social Welfare pensions and Public Service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055. For this purpose, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that 1% of GNP is to be paid from the Exchequer into the Fund each year. The transfers to the NPRF from the Exchequer for the years 2005 to 2007 were as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">2005 — €1,320.250 million</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">2006 — €1,446.500 million</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">2007 — €1,615.500 million</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">The 2008 Budget provision is €1,690 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The estimated market value of the fund on 26 December 2007 was €21.3 billion. The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission publishes fund value and performance figures on a quarterly basis. I understand that an updated 2007 outturn and outturn figures to the end of March 2008 will be published shortly.  The full accounts of the Fund are published in the annual reports of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission. The reports are available on the Commission's website <i>www.nprf.ie</i>.  The liability of the Exchequer for public pensions is normally set out in terms of a percentage of GDP. The latest projections are for public pension expenditure to increase from around 5% of GDP in 2007 to 7.6% in 2025. These projections cover the cost of both Social Welfare and Public Service pensions. The contribution that the NPRF will make towards these costs after 2025 will depend on the precise drawdown pattern adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">I might add that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission shall commission, from time to time, assessments of the projected profile of Exchequer outlays on Social Welfare and Public Service pensions, after consultation with the relevant Ministers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1453">The position is that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1456">In my response of 4 March 2008 to the question raised by Deputy Burton (No. 207) I advised that the Revenue Commissioners had sought to establish from the German Tax authorities if any Irish residents appeared on the list held by them. They subsequently indicated that a response would be provided. This is still awaited.  As the Deputy is aware the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from releasing details of information in relation to taxpayers, except where this is permitted under statute. For example under the provisions of Section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the Revenue Commissioners publish quarterly lists of details relating to tax defaulters in Iris Oifiguil, where settlements involving tax, interest and penalties have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">If there are Irish resident taxpayers on the list to which the Deputy refers and the relevant information is made available to Revenue by the German Tax authorities, their tax affairs will be the subject of inquiries by Revenue.

            <p eId="para_1464">I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 102 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Increases for office holders and a number of other groups were recommended in Report No. 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector. The Review body is an independent standing body whose primary function is to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to higher public servants. As well as members of the Government and Ministers of State, the remit of the Review Body includes higher grades in the civil service, local authorities and the HSE, chief executives of non-commercial State bodies, higher ranks in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, and members of the judiciary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">The Review Body found that the remuneration of many senior public service posts is below private sector levels even when allowance is made for the superior value of public service pensions. In relation to members of the Government and other political office holders, the Review Body considered that direct comparison with the private sector was not appropriate and that the remuneration of senior public servants was a more relevant comparator. In their case, therefore, the comparison with the private sector is an indirect one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">The overall effect of the review is that the salaries recommended are below the average level of salaries in the private sector since the recommendations of the Review Body are based on the lower quartile of the private sector rates and have been further reduced by 15% to allow for the superior value of public service pensions relative to the private sector.  It is established Government policy to accept the recommendations of this independent review body and this approach has been taken by successive Governments. In line with the established practice, the Government decided to accept and implement the recommendations of the review Body.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">In the case of public service groups generally covered by the Review Body's recommendations, the Government decided that the increases recommended by the Review Body would be implemented on the following phased basis:</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">5% from 14 September 2007, the date of the Report, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date;</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">half the balance from 1 September 2008; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">the remaining balance from 1 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">As the Deputy is aware, the Government has reviewed the arrangements set out above in respect of their application to members of the Government and Ministers of State.   In their cases, it was decided in December last that the increases would be deferred and would be phased as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">4% from 1 September 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">half the balance from 1 September 2009; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">the balance from 1 September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">This will mean that the full increase to political office holders will not be paid until 1 September 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">I should first explain that policy responsibility for market abuse legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The legislative framework relevant to market abuse issues is S.I. No. 392 of 2005, the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations, 2005.  Responsibility for the administration of that legislation is a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">I am aware of the recent reports of alleged irregularities with respect to the short-selling of Irish banking stocks.  I am of course concerned to learn that such practices may be occurring.  On 20th March, the Financial Regulator (FR) made a statement drawing public attention to incorrect rumours circulating in the market and reminding market participants of their responsibilities in handling such rumours.  In the course of that statement the FR advised that it was examining certain transactions, as one would expect it to do when such unusual trading takes place.  I understand that the FR has been in contact with market participants and will be working with other regulators including the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) to uncover the source of false and misleading rumours circulating in financial markets at that time.  I am satisfied that we have a robust and effective legislative framework in place in Ireland closely based on the EU Market Abuse Directive which embodies best practice international standards to guard against market misconduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">As regards the type of sanctions that could apply in the case of illegal trading practices, I would direct the Deputy's attention to Section 32 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2005 which provides, in the case of conviction on indictment under Irish market abuse law, for a fine not exceeding €10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.</p>

            <p eId="para_1484">The Irish banks' liquidity arrangements are sound and the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Service Authority of Ireland has recently stated his view that the sector is comfortably meeting the more stringent prudential liquidity requirements introduced by the Financial Regulator before the recent market disruption commenced.  This view is echoed in the recent report of the OECD, which points out that Irish banks entered the current period of international financial turmoil in a very strong position and that they, therefore, have considerable capacity to respond to unexpected developments. The OECD noted that Ireland's sustained economic growth in recent years has ensured that Irish banks are well positioned to deal with recent market developments. In this regard, the OECD welcomed the findings that Irish banks have little exposure to the sub-prime market, hedge funds and the private equity sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">In relation to the question of tighter regulation, I note the clear recommendation in the recent OECD report that the costs and benefits of regulation be carefully weighed so as to continue to secure the benefits of financial innovation in reducing liquidity constraints, a wider spreading of risks and development of new products to meet a wider range of borrower needs. EU Finance Ministers are alert to the need to ensure an appropriate balance in regulation that yields both effective and efficient regulatory outcomes that safeguard the interest of consumers. To this end, they have adopted an extensive programme of work aimed at putting in place a comprehensive response to developments in financial markets. This road map includes reviewing, along with the EU's international partners, how to further improve transparency of complex financial instruments, valuation standards, the prudential framework, risk management and supervision and market functioning including the role of ratings agencies. Ireland is fully participating in this work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1487">On Budget day, GDP was forecast to rise by 3.0 per cent this year, with GNP forecast to rise by 2.8 per cent. The Budget day forecasts have not changed. At the time, the median forecast for 2008 among economic commentators was for GDP growth of 3.25 per cent. In other words, my Department's forecasts were marginally below the market consensus.  In terms of next year, GDP was forecast to increase by 3.5 per cent at Budget time, while GNP was forecast to rise by 3.3 per cent.  However, in framing these forecasts a number of downside risks to the economic outlook were identified on Budget day. These risks included the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the US, the possibility of adverse exchange rate movements, the possibility that financial market difficulties could persist for longer than assumed and the possibility of a sharper contraction in new house building.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">It now appears that some of these risks have materialised and in this regard other economic commentators that produce forecasts on a more frequent basis have revised their forecasts downwards.  The market consensus is now for GDP growth, of around 2.25 per cent this year.  My Department continues to monitor developments and advises accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1490">The economic environment for business is more challenging as we move into the early months of 2008. The reported Exchequer Statement at the end of the first quarter showed Corporation Tax receipts were marginally behind profile at that stage. However, as the bulk of Corporation Tax is collected towards the end of the year it is too early to predict the full year performance at this juncture.  While this is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the basis of data supplied by him, I understand that the performance of enterprise agency assisted companies for the first quarter of 2008 is similar to the same period in 2007.  I am also encouraged by the fact that overall job losses in agency assisted companies notified for the first quarter of this year are, in fact, below the level recorded for the first three months of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provide a range of supports and programmes to assist indigenous enterprises and start ups and continue to develop and refine their client offerings in light of the changing business environment.

            <p eId="para_1493">Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and is responsible for the investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF).  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission joined a group of the world's largest institutional investment funds in signing the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment when they were launched in April 2006. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices and, thereby, to improve long-term returns.  As set out in its Annual Report 2006, the Commission's initial focus in its implementation of the Principles is on the development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy and the development of the capacity to engage with the companies in which Fund moneys are invested on environmental, social and governance issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">In relation to the issue of cluster munitions, it is Government policy to campaign for a complete ban on the use of such weapons and my colleague, Mr Dermot Ahern, TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs, is working to bring to completion negotiations on the first-ever instrument of international humanitarian law specifically directed against cluster munitions. I understand that there are still significant differences to be resolved in relation to the proposed Convention, including key issues such as definitions. When the precise shape of the Convention is clear, the Government will reflect further on any statutory requirements.  I have raised the issue of investing in shares of companies which are involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions with the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and the Commission has agreed to exclude companies involved in the manufacture of cluster munitions from the Fund. The Commission is currently in the process of implementing this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1496">At Budget time, my Department projected an increase in consumer spending of 3.8 per cent this year. This is lower than last year and reflects more modest employment growth and the absence of any significant SSIA impact. The Budget day forecasts for VAT receipts this year are partly based on this more modest rate of consumer spending.  VAT receipts for the first quarter are slightly behind the expected profile for the first three months. However, while it is too early to say with certainty, the weakness seems to be related to the property market and not consumer spending.  The main source of short-term trends on consumer spending is the monthly retail sales data series, published by the CSO.  The latest data relate to January, and show a year-on-year inflation-adjusted increase of 3.0 per cent in consumer spending.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of claimants for top slicing relief in respect of payments made as compensation for loss of office which has been compiled on the basis of income tax returns for 2004, the most recent year for which full actual figures are available, is 1,400. There are preliminary indications that the numbers of claimants for 2005 is of a similar order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their experience that employees who are made redundant are generally made fully aware of their entitlements by their employers and/or trade union etc., and consequently the likelihood of a timely claim not being made is remote.  There are no definitive statistics available on the number of refund claims rejected for claimants of top slicing relief, because the claims were made outside the ‘four year rule' for claiming repayments.  While Revenue is aware of some claims in this category being rejected, I am advised that the number of such claims would be minimal and there is no mechanism for readily identifying them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2040">While there are a number of challenges facing the economy, the fundamentals are still good.  For instance, our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area, our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments, we have a dynamic and well educated labour force, we have a pro-business outward looking society and the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">Budget 2008 was, however, predicated on a slowing economy. In addition a number of domestic and international downside risks were identified at that time. It is now clear that some of these risks have materialised. Bearing this in mind at Budget time, I provided for an increase in current spending of around 9 per cent this year.  This is higher than the projected growth in tax revenues and therefore represents a significant stimulus to the economy.  I am also giving priority to full implementation of the National Development Plan, and an increase in capital spending of 12 per cent this year has been provided for.  In the short term, this will help to absorb some of the slack emerging from the new house building sector; over the medium term this spending will help to boost the productive capacity of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">The Government is also committed to education, training and life-long learning in order to ensure that those losing their jobs can acquire the necessary skills to gain employment in expanding sectors of the economy.  Through the social partnership process, the Government is also supporting improvements in competitiveness by promoting sensible wage developments as well as reforming the public sector.  We are also committed to maintaining flexibility in our economy and to maintaining a low burden of taxation of capital and labour in order to reward work and enterprise.</p>

            <p eId="para_2044">The Government recognises that, in a small open economy such as Ireland's, it is imperative that sustainable export growth is maintained.  Such growth can only be realised through ensuring that our economy and exports, in particular, remain competitive.  Our competitiveness determines our ability to trade in international markets.  In order to maintain or indeed to improve our competitiveness it is necessary to ensure that increases in costs do not outstrip increases in productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">In support of this, the Government has implemented policies which are aimed at rewarding both work and enterprise through maintaining a low tax burden on both capital and labour.  Furthermore, the continued roll out of the National Development Plan remains a key priority for both myself and the Government as a whole, including substantial investment in capital which is helping to eliminate bottlenecks which hinder economic efficiency and thus enhance competitiveness.  While we have seen productivity increases in recent years, costs and particularly labour costs have risen faster.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">As measures designed to enhance productivity are slow to bear fruit, if Ireland is to recover lost competitiveness it is imperative that the cost of doing business here does not become prohibitive. Therefore it is vital that restraint is shown in the forthcoming wage negotiations.  Pursuit of unsustainable wage increases that cannot be justified by their productivity will, if achieved, only constitute short-term gains with significant long-term costs for all.</p>

            <p eId="para_2048">Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has risen by 5.0 per cent in the twelve months to March 2008.  The main contributions to this increase, in order of importance were: housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (which includes mortgage repayments) contributing just over 2.0 per cent; food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing almost 1.1 per cent; and transport contributing 0.75 per cent. Therefore, out of the twelve categories comprising the basket of goods that make up the CPI, three contributed almost 80 per cent of the total inflation in the twelve months to March 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">In terms of the inflation impact from last year's interest rate increases, I addressed this in this year's Budget when I increased the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first time buyers.  This I believe is the appropriate targeted response to such specific cost pressures.  To the extent that inflation is externally-driven — such as through commodity prices — it is essential that such increases are not exacerbated by generating second-round effects through inflation-chasing pay settlements. To do so will only further adversely impact on Ireland's competitiveness.  In the sectors that contribute to domestically-generated inflation, pay and profit margin restraint are essential, as well as increased competition so as to keep down price increases.  Therefore it is essential that the upcoming pay talks under the Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, take account of the reality that we all face.</p>

            <p eId="para_2051">The main contributions to the annual increase of 5.0 per cent in CPI over the 12 months to March 2008, in order of importance were: housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels contributing just over 2.0 per cent; food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing almost 1.1 per cent; and transport contributing 0.75 per cent. Therefore out of the twelve categories comprising the basket of goods that make up the CPI, three contributed almost 80 per cent of the total inflation in the twelve months to March 2008.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the change in the average level of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.  It measures in index form the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services.  The Director General of the Central Statistics Office has sole responsibility for — and has full independence when — deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used in compiling the CPI.</p>
            <p eId="para_2052">However, it must be acknowledged that we have no control over some of the factors influencing the CPI — such as commodity prices, the exchange rate and mortgage interest rates. In this regard, we must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. Seeking to maintain low inflation, the pursuit of  a sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are important.  Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_2054">The Government's approach to taxation is set out in the Programme for Government and in recent Budgets and Finance Bills.  In addition the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, states that the Government is committed to a taxation policy designed to maintain and strengthen the competitive position of the economy, foster improvements in productive capacity, economic and social development, and equity, while maintaining a sound fiscal stance.  These commitments underpinned the tax changes which I announced in the Budget and which were given legislative effect in the Finance Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentives I announced in Budget 2006 that most of the existing reliefs either had achieved the objectives set out for them or were no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and were being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions.  The role that time-limited tax relief schemes can play in supporting public policy objectives is assessed continually in the formulation of tax policy in the context of the annual Budget process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2057">On Budget day, GDP was projected by my Department to rise by 3.0 per cent this year, before increasing to 3.5 per cent next year and to 4.1 per cent in 2010.  The equivalent figures for GNP were for growth of 2.8 per cent this year, followed by 3.3 per cent next year and 3.9 per cent in 2010.  The Budget forecasts have not been changed.  At the time a number of downside risks to these forecasts were also outlined.  These risks included the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the US, the possibility of adverse exchange rate movements, the possibility that financial market difficulties could persist for longer than assumed and the possibility of a sharper contraction in new house building.  It now appears that some of these risks have materialised.  As a result, the consensus among economic commentators for GDP growth for this year has declined from around 3¼ per cent last December to about 2¼ per cent at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_2063">Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has risen by 5.0 per cent in the twelve months to March 2008.  The main contributions to this increase, in order of importance were: housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (which includes mortgage repayments) contributing just over 2.0 per cent; food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing almost 1.1 per cent; and transport contributing 0.75 per cent. Therefore, out of the twelve categories comprising the basket of goods that make up the CPI, three contributed almost 80 per cent of the total inflation in the twelve months to March 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">In terms of the inflation impact from last year's interest rate increases, I addressed this in this year's Budget when I increased the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first time buyers.  This I believe is the appropriate targeted response to such specific cost pressures.  To the extent that inflation is externally-driven — such as commodity prices — it is essential that such increases are not exacerbated by generating second-round effects through inflation-chasing pay settlements.  To do so will only further adversely impact on Ireland's competitiveness.  In the sectors that contribute to domestically-generated inflation, pay and profit margin restraint are essential, as well as increased competition so as to keep down price increases.  Therefore it is essential that the upcoming pay talks under the Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, take account of the reality that we all face.</p>

            <p eId="para_2066">The fiscal position at end-March was some EUR600 million behind where we had expected.  Furthermore, I have indicated that at this stage it is not expected that this tax shortfall, particularly in CGT, will be recouped later in the year.  In terms of new house completions, the indications are now suggesting that housing output may be below that anticipated at Budget time.  Some of this weakness is evidenced in the performance of taxes in the first quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">While our fiscal position may have weakened from that envisaged at Budget time, it is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio.  Also, the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external ‘shocks' so that our medium term prospects are favourable.  For instance:</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area;</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">we have a dynamic and well educated labour force;</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">we have a pro-business outward looking society;</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">I wish to stress that the Government accepts that there can be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy and, in that context, the implementation of the National Development Plan remains a key priority.  As regards current day-to-day expenditure, it is crucial that the agreed budget spending limits are adhered to this year.  As I indicated at Budget time, the rate of increase in current spending over the medium term must be managed carefully and kept within available resources.  This Government intends to do just that.  Ireland is compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements and the Government is committed to respecting the terms of the Pact as the economy adjusts to a period of slower growth.</p>

I would assure the Deputy that the policies and measures being taken by the Government on alcohol misuse are consistent with the aims and objectives of the World Health Organisation's 2001 Declaration on Young People and Alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">A key priority for the Government is to protect young people from the harm caused by alcohol misuse.  In order to achieve this, we are taking a twin-track approach, involving, on the one hand, policies and interventions targeted at vulnerable populations and, on the other, policies targeted at the population at large to reduce the overall level of alcohol misuse in society.  The measures announced this week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to licensing law form part of our response.  Today I have announced further restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol which aim to reduce the exposure of young people to such messages.</p>

The recent study on inter-country adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for foreign adoption in Europe. In addition, as a result of the increased number of children coming from abroad, a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports from sending countries has been created. Both assessments and post-placement reports are being undertaken by HSE social work staff.  The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences. In a number of areas, the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">The HSE has undertaken a review of the inter-country adoption service. This review examined staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service. The HSE has indicated that it will contact the Department shortly with a proposed strategy on the management of the service into the future based on this work and parallel discussions with professionals within the service. I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system.</p>

            <p eId="para_2273">I have been informed by the HSE that it has, to date, received notification from over 500 community pharmacy contractors indicating their intention to either cease providing services from 1st May 2008, or otherwise reserving their right to do so.  Community pharmacy contractors are required under the terms of their contract to give three months notice of their intention to withdraw. The HSE is writing to each of the contractors concerned, seeking formal confirmation of their intentions and pointing out that 3 months notice of cessation of service is required. At this point in time, only two contractors have actually given formal notification of termination in accordance with the requirements in the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">The HSE has developed a national contingency planning framework which will inform and provide direction to local operational management for the development of local area-specific contingency plans. As service provision, geographical and demographic circumstances will vary from area to area, each local health area is developing its own area-specific contingency plan within the context of the overall national framework.  I believe that threats of withdrawal from the community pharmacy contract are unjustified and not in anyone's interest. There is no need to bring patients into a dispute between the pharmacists and the HSE. There can be no grounds for causing upset or anxiety about the supply of prescriptions to patients.</p>

The provision of replies to Parliamentary Questions on the HSE website is one of a number of measures the Executive has taken as part of an ongoing process of meeting its obligations with regard to accountability and transparency. Access to responses issued by the HSE in respect of Parliamentary Questions referred to the Executive for direct reply was available on the HSE's old website. My Department has been informed by the Executive that there was a slight delay in the planned transfer of its responses to Parliamentary Questions to its new website. However my Department has been informed that this problem has been resolved,  that the HSE's responses to Parliamentary Questions will continue to be available on the Executive's new website and can be accessed via a quicklink function.</p>

            <p eId="para_2311">There are currently ten State owned port commercial companies set up under the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2000. The State has a 100% shareholding in each of the companies and they are regarded as State assets. Under the Act, decisions regarding the disposal and purchase of land are primarily a matter for the companies' boards.  Each of the port companies is required to publish an audited annual report and accounts. The annual reports are reported on to Government and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are ten regional harbours, which are State assets. These harbours are managed under the Harbours Act 1946 by a harbour authority composed of commissioners whose duties include the management, control, maintenance and operation of the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">Policy in relation to the regional harbours, as published in the Ports Policy Statement in 2005, is that the continued operation of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance and that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement on transfer to local authorities, the option of sale of the harbours will be considered.  In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration will be given to bringing such harbours under the control of a port company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">Three Harbour Authorities (Annagassan, Dingle and Sligo) have already ceased to exist in accordance with the above policy. In the case of Dingle, it has been designated as a Fisheries Harbour Centre.  For over three years now, my Department has been funding essential works to protect the fabric of the regional harbours at an average cost of approximately €4m per annum pending the transfer of the harbours to local control.  The harbour commissioners are required to produce annual accounts and these are subject to audit by the Local Government Auditor.</p>

            <p eId="para_2328">The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  Today, in Ireland, there are over 1,000 IDA supported companies employing in excess of 136,000 people.  While competition for FDI continues to be relentless, Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While our costs may be higher now, the strategy we have put in place in response to this is to position the country as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs in many of the leading companies in Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Medical Technology, Financial Services, International Services, Digital Media and ICT sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The 2007 business environment ranking of the Economist Intelligence Unit placed Ireland 10th globally out of 82 countries, naming it as one of the most attractive business locations in the world.  One of the Government's main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business.  In that regard, we work to maintain and enhance our competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage.  In line with the NDP and the Programme for Government, we are developing our R&amp;D base and investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures.  In addition, we are promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning as well as up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">The overall objective for the future must be to place Ireland at the leading edge of the global economy in specific competencies or industry niches, where we can be a prime location for high value activities.  This means not relying solely on an individual project focus, but rather on fostering the development of clusters of excellence in which technology companies, education and research institutes, venture capital and business service providers all form a network to create a self-reinforcing climate of innovation and entrepreneurship.  I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by Government together with the sterling work being done by IDA Ireland will continue to bear fruit in terms of continued foreign direct investment and I am confident that Ireland is well positioned to win further leading FDI in 2008 and the years beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_2332">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.

            <p eId="para_2344">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.  To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and people with disabilities may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2358">The level of the weekly social insurance contribution that is payable is, for the most part, determined by both the level of reckonable earnings in that week and the appropriate PRSI rate. The PRSI exemption on low earnings has now been increased to €352 per week (up from €339 in 2007) — any earnings above this level are liable to an employee PRSI contribution rate of 4%. Above this threshold point contributors are entitled to a PRSI-Free Allowance of €127 per week that reduces the ‘step-effect', whereby an employee with gross weekly pay over €352 could have lower net pay that an employee earning €352 or less per week, of the threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">Therefore, a person insured with an income up to €352 per week will have a nil liability whereas a person with an income of more than €352 per week will have a PRSI liability of 4% on the portion of that income above the €127 PRSI-Free Allowance.  This tiered system enhances employment incentives for low-earning employees by ensuring that they do not experience financial difficulties from the payment of social insurance contributions.  There are currently no plans to change the existing provisions.</p>

The fact that a couple reside apart does not in itself satisfy this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">According to a High Court judgement in 1998 dealing with the issue of couples living apart it was set out that marriage is not primarily concerned with where the spouses live or whether they live under the same roof, and indeed there can be a number of circumstances in which the parties are not living under the same roof as, for example, where one party is in hospital or an institution of some kind, or is obliged to spend a great deal of time away from home in the course of his or her employment.  Such ‘separations' do not necessarily constitute the persons are living apart from each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">There must be something more than mere physical separation and the mental or intellectual attitude of the parties is also of considerable relevance.  Both of these elements must be considered in conjunction with each other. Accordingly parties who are physically or geographically separated may in fact maintain a full matrimonial relationship.  A separated applicant for one-parent family payment must demonstrate that the marriage tie between him/her and his/her spouse has ended.</p>

This increasing cumulative surplus in the fund is the continuation of a trend which commenced in 1997 when a surplus arose for the first time since the fund was established in 1953.  In the previous forty-four years of the existence of the fund, there was a shortfall between the amount of income received into the fund and the amount of expenditure paid out of it, which was made up by way of an Exchequer subvention in each year, as provided for under the Social Welfare Acts.  The Acts also provide for the investment of the amount of the surplus arising in the fund. The investment account of the fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, subject to guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2415">Invalidity pension is a social insurance based payment paid to people who are permanently incapable of work due to disability or illness. One of the conditions for receipt of the payment is that the recipient does not engage in any form of employment.  However, an exemption to this requirement is provided for in very specific circumstances. Such an exemption, which typically lasts for 12 months, will normally take the form of employment which is deemed by the Department to be both part-time (i.e. not more than 19.5 hours per week) and rehabilitative in nature or, alternatively, a community employment scheme or a training course arranged by FÁS. An application for such an exemption must be made to the Department in advance of the employment or training course beginning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">This exemption from the general rules of behaviour was introduced for a very specific purpose, namely to allow persons who are regarded as permanently incapable of work to engage in training or part time, rehabilitative employment which would increase the opportunity for them to return to the open labour market. To increase the hours which the claimant would be allowed work, as suggested by the Deputy, would blur the distinction between part-time, rehabilitative employment and full-time, open labour market employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">For those persons in receipt of invalidity pension who wish to work more than 20 hours per week or move towards full time employment, the back to work allowance may be a more appropriate mechanism to achieve this. This allowance ensures that the claimant will retain a portion of their payment, including any secondary benefits, for a period of 3 years following their return to employment. Moreover, if the person feels they are unable to continue with their employment and wishes to return to benefit, their entitlement to invalidity pension will be automatically restored without the need to re-apply for the pension.</p>

            <p eId="para_2697">The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs met the EU Commission President last week as part of his visit to Ireland to address the National Forum on Europe.  The ongoing WTO negotiations were high on the agenda of these meetings and the Irish position and concerns in these negotiations were clearly expressed to President Barroso.  It was emphasized that Ireland is seeking a balanced and fair outcome to this WTO Round across all of the various negotiating pillars.  Ireland's position is that the final agreement which is reached must not place a disproportionate burden on EU agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2698">This is the position which I and my Government colleagues have been and will continue to express in the strongest terms at our many bilateral meetings with the Commission and at EU Council of Ministers meetings.  The negotiations have reached another critical stage with the prospect of a Ministerial meeting next month in Geneva.  There are still many issues to be resolved, not alone on the agriculture dossier, but also in the non-agricultural market access, services, rules and trade facilitation areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2699">At this point in time, we can only speculate as to the content of a final WTO deal, or indeed, whether such a deal will be concluded.  It is far too early to decide what position Ireland would take on a final WTO deal.  We are still in the throes of negotiations and there is no certainty as yet as regards the timing, or indeed, the shape of a final deal.  The Government will take a final position when the shape and the details of any deal are known.  In the meantime I will continue to pursue a positive outcome for EU agriculture in these ongoing negotiations.</p>

Over 11,000 installations currently participate in the EU ETS.  This includes over one hundred Irish installations, 33 of which are in the dairy, food or drinks sector.  My officials are closely monitoring developments in the review process, and met representatives of installations that participate in the Emission Trading Scheme on April 23 to discuss issues relating to the dairy, food and drinks sector in the context of post-2012 emission trading and the Commission's proposals to amend the current Directive.   I am committed to making all efforts necessary to defend the best interests of all participating Irish installations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2712">The anti-dumping measures, which create a minimum import price for farmed salmon entering the EU market from Norway, have been in place since early 2006. These measures have brought price stability to the market following proven dumping by Norway. This market stability has led to renewed investor confidence in Irish companies. The trade measures are now under threat due mainly to the strong opposition among many other Member States to their continuation.  At a recent meeting with the Director General of DG Trade John Browne Minister for State at my Department made a very strong case for the continuation of these measures. We will continue to work closely with the EU Commission, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and our Scottish and UK colleagues, as well as, the Irish salmon-producing sector, to retain these measures for a further period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2722">The requirement to make all payments under EU funded or co-funded schemes directly into bank accounts arises under EU Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 which lays down the rules on the financing and management of the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2007 to 2013.  The detailed implementing rules as set out in EU Commission Regulation (EC) 885/2006, require that all EU paying agencies must adopt procedures to ensure that payments are made only to bank accounts with effect from the 2009 financial year which begins on 16 October 2008. As the designated paying agency for EU funds, my Department is obliged to adhere to these rules. Farmers can choose to have their payments made by cheque or electronic funds transfer directly into their bank account for the remainder of the 2008 EU financial year which ends on 15 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">My Department notified the new requirement to farmers on a number of occasions over the past year or so and will be writing to farmers again this week.

The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics.

            <p eId="para_2751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">It is estimated that in the region of 28,000 children benefit from English language support education.  The majority of English language teaching posts are allocated on the basis of full-time posts rather than teaching hours. I have already allocated almost 2,000 language support teachers in the current school year.  The corresponding figures for the 2006/07 and 2005/06 school years are approximately over 1,400 and over 800 respectively.  Additional supports are provided for children in schools who do not meet the qualifying criteria for the appointment of full-time teachers in the form of grant aids for the employment of part-time English language support teachers.  469 schools have benefited from this type of financial support in the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">The total cost of providing English language support to children in our primary and post primary schools is estimated to be in the region of €126 million in the current school year.  The corresponding estimated costs for the 2006/07 and 2005/06 school years are in the region of €91 million and €52 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">The substantial increase in the number of language support teachers underlines the important improvements made in this area in recent years.  The previous limit of two teachers per primary school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil was changed.  An individual primary school may now be allocated up to six language support posts under the improved arrangements in place.  In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.</p>

            <p eId="para_2756">My Department is conscious of the extent of housing developments in the Lucan area and the consequences which this has for school provision. Because of this, substantial additional accommodation has been provided in the area by my Department at both primary and post-primary levels in recent years and this is set to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">Based on current demographic trends, my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term and it has asked South Dublin County Council to identify a site for this development. A timeframe for the delivery of the school will be known when a suitable site has been identified and acquired. The local authority has a number of Local Area Plans in train and it is likely that we will be able to secure a site under this process. My Department is conscious of the lead-in period for the delivery of a post-primary school and it would be anxious to conclude the site issue as soon as possible. It will continue to engage with the local authority until this matter is resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2758">In the meantime, my Department has increased capacity at the four existing post-primary schools to 3,000 places overall. The current combined enrolment is 2,500 which means that there is spare capacity for some 500 pupil places.  A building project which is in train for Lucan Community College will further increase capacity by 200 pupil places. In addition to this, a building project for St Joseph's College has been assessed and the project brief, which will provide an additional 200 pupil places, has been agreed.  The combined total of extra places which will be available when these projects are completed will be 900 which is the equivalent to the size of a post primary school in its own right.  These measures will assist in reducing pressure for pupil places in the short to medium term while the process of advancing the project for a new school continues.</p>

For example enlarged print, Braille translation, modified questions, use of a scribe, a reader, a personal assistant, a tape recorder or word processor, may be allowed depending on needs.

            <p eId="para_2775">Green-Schools is an international environmental education programme, designed to promote and acknowledge whole-school action to care for the environment. It is both a programme and an award scheme. Green-Schools in Ireland is operated and co-ordinated by the Environmental Education Unit of An Taisce.  The programme complements the formal curricula in Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) at primary level and the Science and Geography curricula at post-primary level by demonstrating the application of an eco-friendly approach to environmental issues in the school context. This process increases students' awareness of the importance of environmental issues so that it is more likely that they will become environmentally aware in their personal and home lives. Over 2,800 primary, secondary and special schools in Ireland are currently taking part in the programme and over 1,250 have been awarded the Green Flag.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">With respect to energy programmes that would complement environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past nine years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">The guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception. The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies.  This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency. This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">An information package is currently being prepared for schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. As part of this exercise, technical guidance and specifications for the most common problems that are likely to arise in this area will be provided. The demand for water in schools must be minimised firstly through push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks, etc, then the potential for rainwater harvesting can be maximised by reducing the amount of mains water used to flush toilets.</p>

            <p eId="para_2780">I can assure the Deputy that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.  There is no requirement for schools to report incidents of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case. Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2781">Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  In view of the increasing demands which have been placed on schools as a result of statutory obligations and the requirement for policies in a range of areas, my Department has been working to ensure greater availability of guidelines and template policies to assist schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">Last year, I announced the publication on my Department's website of policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying, as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and will be informed by broad consultation.  Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own "Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour".  This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in International best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.  My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the "think b4 u click" internet safety campaign. This new campaign seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line.  The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the National Centre Technology in Education (NCTE).  This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture -sharing websites.  This new initiative perfectly compliments the other NCTE safety activities that are already up and running successfully such as Webwise, SAFT and the Once projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">Dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.  The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</p>

Some 500 spouses of deceased Veterans are in receipt of monthly allowances from my Department.

They are specially reviewed from time to time, the most recent review having been undertaken in the context of the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  On that occasion, the payments were increased by 50% from 1 April 2006, having been previously increased by 50% from 1 July 2004 and by 50% from 1 January 2000.  Thus, all of these payments have been more than trebled in amount since 1 January 2000, which is a very substantial level of increase by any standard.

Of course, Community Policing involves more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána and all Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the Force.   I am advised by the Garda authorities that the operational costs for community policing are met from the overall budget allocation for the policing of each Garda Region and Division.  Accordingly, a breakdown of these figures is not readily available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2876">I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), 256 firearms were seized or recovered  in 2007 and 77 in 2008 up to 6 April.  There were 6,289 arrests in 2007 and 1,863 in 2008 up to 6 April.  It is estimated that property to the value of €10.1 million was recovered in 2007 and €2.2 million in 2008 up to 6 April.  Outside the DMR, 309 firearms were seized in 2007 and 84 in 2008 up to 6 April.  There were 10,638 arrests in 2007 and 2,851 in 2008 up to 6 April.  All figures are operational and subject to change.</p>

            <p eId="para_2879">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question (ref 15591/08) of 23 April 2008. The position in relation to long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on the 23 April 2007. I understand that applications received in August 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</p>

            <p eId="para_2935">The person concerned arrived in the State on 20 March 2003 and claimed asylum. Her application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned was informed by letter dated 8 April 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">On 3 August 2004 my predecessor refused the person in question permission to remain in State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of the order was served by registered post and she was required to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 27 January 2005. She failed to present as required and was classified as evading her deportation on 2 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">Subsequently, the person concerned applied for asylum in the UK on 25 February 2005 under a different name and date of birth. The UK authorities contacted the Dublin Unit in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) on 7 April 2005 in this regard. Following this contact, the Irish authorities agreed to take back the person concerned. A further letter dated 16 February 2006 was sent by the UK Home Office to the ORAC advising of the birth of a baby daughter to the person concerned and requesting that the Irish State accept this child along with its mother. ORAC agreed to this request and mother and baby were due to be transferred to the State from the UK on 28 April 2006. For operational reasons on the UK side, the transfer did not then take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">A further transfer date of 12 May 2006 was agreed but did not proceed due to the receipt of representations of a medical nature in respect of the person concerned.  Following consideration of these representations, mother and baby were finally returned to the State on 6 October 2006. The person concerned presented herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 16 October 2006 and was given further presentation dates which she kept. She is due to present again on 28 April 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2939">On 11 January 2007 an application for asylum in respect of the minor child of the person concerned was made in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  Said application is now the subject of judicial review proceedings. On foot of correspondence dated 17 January 2007 directed to the GNIB, but which was brought to the attention of officials in my Department, an undertaking by letter dated 19 January 2007 was given to the effect that the deportation order in respect of the person concerned would not be enforced until such time as the application for refugee status in respect of her minor child has been processed.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

Officials in that section are currently processing applications received in July 2005 and have approximately 15,200 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned. These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  However, I understand the individual in question is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the first half of 2009.  I will inform the Deputy and the individual concerned when I have reached a decision on the application.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2961">I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Question No. 106 of 7th December 2006 and Parliamentary Question No. 610 of 6th July 2006. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">An application from the person referred to by the Deputy was received by the Immigration Division of my Department on the 5th July 2006 seeking long term residency.  This application was refused on the 24th October 2006, as the individual did not meet the minimum criteria of over five years in the State on work permit conditions.  On two occasions the Immigration Division of my Department granted the person referred to by the Deputy Stamp 1 conditions for a four month period in order to obtain a work permit.  To date the Immigration Division has not received any further applications for long term residency from this person and therefore are unable to confirm if he meets the minimum criteria for the long term residency scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">The procedure in relation to applications is as follows.  At time of processing, each application is examined to verify the applicant meets the residency criteria (legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions).  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary. Should an applicant meet the residency criteria a character reference check is then carried out.  This includes a requirement for all applicants to produce a police clearance certificate from their country of origin and any other country they resided in prior to travelling to this State.   The requirement for a police clearance certificate was introduced recently as part of the character clearance aspect of the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">Any application received by the Immigration Division which does not have the necessary endorsement stamps showing that they have been legally resident in the State for five years on the basis of work/permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions is automatically refused.</p>

            <p eId="para_3066">The Immigration Act, which was commenced on the 15th September 2003, contained a number of key changes to the Refugee Act, 1996 which included the imposition on applicants of a clear statutory duty to actively pursue their asylum applications and co-operate at all times with the processing agencies or face having their applications deemed withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3067">The most common reasons for an application to be deemed withdrawn are where the applicant fails to attend for an interview or oral appeal hearing without reasonable cause; fails to co-operate with the Refugee Applications Commissioner or furnish information relevant to his or her application or appeal; or an applicant fails to notify the Commissioner or Refugee Appeals Tribunal of his or her postal address or change of address.</p>

However, where ORAC considers that its procedures have been fully and correctly adhered to, it is prepared to contest judicial review proceedings in order to fulfil its statutory responsibility to protect the integrity of the asylum process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">Where a case is decided by the Courts in favour of the applicant, the Courts usually award costs against the State. There can be a significant gap between the award of costs by the Courts in particular cases and the payment of those costs due to delays in the submitting of bills of costs by the applicant's legal representative. Where the case is settled by the State, the terms of the settlement includes a commitment to reconsider the applicant's application of refugee status.</p>

            <p eId="para_3552">The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  The Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding.  Under the Fire Services Change Programme a Risk Based Approach to Fire Safety Management is being developed.  When this system is available it will assist fire authorities in carrying out a risk analysis in their functional areas which will, inter alia, inform the allocation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3553">Options for the future development of fire and emergency management services are being reviewed in the Department, including the option of a national fire authority, and the need to continue to bring about real and substantive change so that the fire service in Ireland is in line with international standards.  In reaching conclusions on the review, regard must be had to the needs of the fire service and the wider public interest in relation to fire safety matters, and account will be taken of the view of stakeholders. I have asked the key stakeholders to submit their views in writing. Written submissions have been received from the Chief Fire Officers' Association, the County and City Managers' Associations, the Fire Services Council and the Association of County and City Councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_3554">Three investigations into the Bray fire tragedy are ongoing by An Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority, and Wicklow County Council.

I believe, therefore, that it would be important to await the outcome of the investigations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3571">In general, planning permission must be sought for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 set out certain exemptions in this area.  These include, subject to certain conditions, works carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service comprising:</p>
            <p eId="para_3572">the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure (subject to a maximum of 12 antennae),</p>

            <p eId="para_3575">The exemptions above are conditional on, among other things, the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of the antennae.</p>
            <p eId="para_3576">The Commission for Communications Regulation is responsible for ensuring that telecommunications operators comply with their licence conditions relating to non-ionising radiation.  It is also the function of the Commission to ensure that all operators are compliant with the international guidelines for general exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications masts and antennae.  As indicated in the reply to question No. 218 of 23 April, it is my intention to further develop the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures to take account of the latest developments in telecommunications technology and related issues, including in particular broadband.</p>

        <b>Deputy Paul Kehoe</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         if, in view of the fact that An Taisce is a listed prescribed body within the planning legislation, which is normally consulted on applications which could have an impact on Ireland’s national heritage, there is a monitoring of the level of efficiency of An Tasice in dealing with the various aspects of a planning application in order that no undue delay can occur, in other words, when An Taisce would make an observation to the local council; if a representative of An Taisce is obliged to visit a site before making an observation, in order to establish the condition of the building on which it is commenting; the reason there is no time limit within which An Taisce must respond to a query from the applicant for planning permission, enabling the applicant to speedily deal with queries from their local authority; when his Department last carried out a review of the operation of this organisation to satisfy itself that it meets all the requirements of being a prescribed organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3578">An Taisce is an independent, voluntary, non-governmental organisation and in general terms it is a matter for such organisations to regulate their own affairs, without Government involvement. I have no role or responsibility in relation to the operation of An Taisce.  Section 33 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that regulations regarding applications for permission may be made requiring, inter alia, planning authorities to notify prescribed bodies of proposed development. Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended by the Planning and Development Regulations 2006) includes An Taisce in the list of bodies prescribed for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3579">When submitting observations on planning applications, prescribed bodies such as An Taisce are bound by the statutory time limits set out in the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, and associated regulations. An Taisce is given notice of planning applications in circumstances where it appears to the planning authority that the proposed development might impact on matters such as areas of special amenity, protected structures, National Monuments and nature conservation.  I will keep the regulations, including the list of prescribed bodies, under regular review, to facilitate delivery of an effective and efficient planning service leading to quality planning decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3581">The Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme was established under the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, (S.I. No. 666 of 2006).  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has been designated as the Issuing Authority with responsibility for the registration of BER Assessors, logging of BER assessments and ongoing management of the BER scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3582">As part of this process SEI issued a training specification in October 2006, which set out the requirements for training courses dealing with the rating of new dwellings.  To date, 21 FETAC/HETAC registered training providers around the country have held training courses on BER for new dwellings.  Currently, there are 520 registered BER assessors, with a further 1,127 qualified assessors for BER of new dwellings yet to register.</p>
            <p eId="para_3583">SEI is currently in discussions with FETAC with regard to extending the FETAC Standard for BER of new dwellings to include existing dwellings.  Similar discussions have also commenced with HETAC trainers.  It is expected that training courses for BER of existing dwellings will be available from September 2008.  A survey of registered assessors has given a positive indication that the majority of registered assessors will be applying to extend their registration to cover both new and existing dwellings.</p>

This will involve the relocation of approximately 300 posts.  Two staff members have transferred to Cavan since 1st January 2008 bringing the total working there to 47.  Current plans envisage that this figure will be increased by up to ten more staff by the middle of the year.</p>
