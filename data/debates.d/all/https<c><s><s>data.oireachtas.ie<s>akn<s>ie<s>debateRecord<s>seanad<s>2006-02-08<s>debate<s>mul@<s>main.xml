          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide appropriate school transport for the students of the Galbally area who attend the second level school in Tipperary town and the pupils in Lisvernane primary school as the existing vehicle is old and is subject to breakdowns, and no safety belts are available for the safety of the pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Dooley of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give due consideration to the integrity of County Clare's county boundary in his consideration of the application by Limerick City Council to extend its boundary.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the measures to be taken for psychiatric services in County Roscommon and if there will be a reduction in services in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give an update on the application for grant aid made by the National Learning Network, Longford, under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Finucane, Dooley and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

        <heading>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_10">Members of the House were saddened to learn last week of the death of Mr. Ruairí Brugha. I will speak on behalf of my party this morning. All Members knew or knew of Ruairí Brugha. I have an ordinary, every day memory of him as a quiet man whom we regularly saw in Oireachtas Library reading his papers. We all did that until recently. He went about his business quietly in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Many tributes to him have been published in the newspapers. As the Cathaoirleach is aware, he was twice a member of this House, serving as the Taoiseach's nominee from 1969 to 1973 and again from 1977 to 1981. It is on this basis that we pay our tributes to him today. Behind his quiet exterior lay a person who was steeped in Irish history. He was the son of Cathal Brugha who was injured during the 1916 Rising and killed in what is now Cathal Brugha Street during the Civil War. Ruairí Brugha later married Máire McSwiney, the daughter of Terence McSwiney, thus uniting two famous patriot families.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Ruairí Brugha's political life was devoted to reconciliation and his demeanour and qualities were in keeping with this aim. He was adopted by, or adopted, the constituency of Dublin South County. From 1973 to 1977, he spoke for the Fianna Fáil leader, Jack Lynch, on many matters relating to Northern Ireland. Fianna Fáil was in opposition at the time. He observed minutely a bipartisan approach to the North with Fine Gael and the Government and was very respectful and conscientious in this regard. He strongly supported the Sunningdale agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Ruairí Brugha was a member of the IRA early in his life. It would have been odd if he did not become a member, given his family background. When he was released from the Curragh on health grounds, he had become disenchanted with the way the IRA had been treated by the Government led by Éamon de Valera. He joined Clann na Poblachta and stood for election but did not succeed in this endeavour. He then returned to the fold, so to speak, where I am sure he was happiest.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">His mother was director of Kingston Clothing Company, a very famous company which he joined as managing director as he had to earn a living while he was on this precarious political path. I understand from a conversation some months ago that he was an excellent managing director. One would not have imagined him in such a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">His wife was the daughter of Terence McSwiney, who was known around the world as a result of his hunger strike, which he endured with heroic dignity. Ruairí Brugha's marriage was a great merging of families. I understand that Máire Brugha's book, which was published before Christmas and launched by the Taoiseach, is a wonderful work which I intend to read.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Ruairí Brugha leaves a widow and four children. We offer the sympathy of this House to them today, bearing in mind that he was an eager attendee of and speaker within it. We also bear in mind the way in which this quiet man was able to shape his life into one of reconciliation and the use of peaceful means to bring about his aims, given that he came from the physical force tradition of Irish nationalism. He never abandoned his commitment to Irish unity, which was his overriding aim, but he strongly believed in reconciliation between Unionists and Nationalists. Throughout his life, he sought to bring about this reconciliation by peaceful means. He was ahead of his time in this regard and we seek to bring about the reconciliation for which he worked. He saw the need for such reconciliation then.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I extend the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad to his wife Máire; their four children, Deirdre, Cathal, Terry and Ruairí; and his sister, Neasa. He graced this House with his presence and powerful ideas about reconciliation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_18">The Leader dealt very comprehensively with the background of Ruairí Brugha, to which I have very little to add, except to endorse, on behalf of Fine Gael, the Leader's comments and tribute to him. I respected the bipartisan approach of Ruairí Brugha and Jack Lynch to the Sunningdale agreement from 1973 to 1977, despite Ruairí Brugha's strong background in physical force nationalism and his father's involvement in it. He deserves considerable respect for this. Their approach was a forerunner for subsequent movement with regards to Northern Ireland where this bipartisan agreement has existed over the years. I acknowledge everything said about Ruairí Brugha by the Leader and pay tribute to him and his long experience in the Seanad. He served as an MEP, a Deputy and a Senator, which I believe to be a unique achievement in Irish politics.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_19">The Independent group in the Seanad would like to associate itself with the comments made by the two previous speakers. Ruairí Brugha was a quiet man. He travelled to and from the Oireachtas Library most days of the week until recently. Very few people would have recognised him, except those of us who knew him for many years. He always moved quietly and never involved himself in conversation until someone spoke to him. He was a bridge builder in many ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">He was probably the most direct link between the physical force revolution and democracy in Ireland, a role he wished to play, and was completely committed to, throughout his life. It is difficult to give even a taste of the extraordinarily varied and complex life he lived.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I first got to know him through the Kingston Clothing Company, which was founded by his maternal grandfather and located in O'Connell Street. He was managing director of this company and his closest friend and eventual brother-in-law, Seán O'Briain from Baile an Fheirtéaraigh, was company secretary. When I first came to Dublin in the 1960s, I was advised to go to Seán O'Briain and Ruairí Brugha in the Kingston Clothing Company in Connell Street if I wanted to buy a suit, which I did. This company was, in many ways, notorious.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Ruairí Brugha was friends with people like Peadar O'Donnell and Brendan Behan. They would meet regularly on a Saturday morning for tea and coffee in the Gresham Hotel. Peadar O'Donnell and Ruairí Brugha argued with and were friends with a wide circle of people. Brendan Behan was Ruairí Brugha's best and worst customer. He would tell the story of how Behan would continually buy overcoats from him. He would buy an overcoat, lose it, buy another and give it away. Eventually, he would have to pay for his coats but he only wished to pay for one despite the fact that he had bought three. He always ended up calling Ruairí Brugha a capitalist, which was the end of every argument. He had a great relationship with Behan and was very saddened by his early passing.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Few people would believe that Ruairí Brugha was so highly principled that he was jailed for who he was, rather than for anything he did. I do not think he ever fired a shot in anger. Having been jailed for no good reason by his country, his church then excommunicated him. He suffered for his principles, without anyone pointing out what he had done wrong. He did not abandon his principles while he was in the Curragh. When he was offered early release, despite the fact that he had done nothing wrong, he refused to offer any kind of excuse for his actions. He served his time until, as the Leader noted, he was eventually released due to poor health.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">He was a complete romantic. The Leader might like to know that when he was in the Curragh, he commissioned an engagement ring to be made from a silver sixpence when he proposed to Máire McSwiney who, of course, accepted. She became the person with the greatest influence on him throughout his life. She was a very positive influence on him because it opened up the width and depth of Europe for him. He was a Francophile who regularly visited France.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">He was, above all, a bridge builder who would always bring people closer together. Ba Ghaeilgeoir den scoth é, agus chaitheadh sé gach samhradh i mBaile an Fheirtéaraigh — ar An Ghráig, i ndáiríre —áit a raibh tigh acu, agus tá sé acu fós, mar is cuimhin liom. Gan amhras, bhí an-ghaol aige leis an áit sin trí Sheán Ó Briain chomh maith. An rud ba thábhachtaí i rith na mblianta sin ná gur bhuail sé le Máire ar An Ghráig chomh maith, nuair a bhí sé ag dul ag rothaíocht timpeall na tíre. He cycled completely around Ireland over a number of summers.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">He was a man who did things. More than anything else he would wish to be remembered, as the Leader stated, as somebody tied to reconciliation as a bridge builder. In the 1940s, he argued against and fought the perceived wisdom about the physical force tradition when it was difficult for him because of his roots and background in the republican movement. He contended the way forward was democracy and that the armed struggle should be put behind the Irish people. He did this constantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">In 1966, on the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, he addressed a large rally in Trafalgar Square. This resonates with a discussion here last week. Flags were waving and the physical force tradition was undoubtedly uppermost in people's minds. Ruairí Brugha stood up in front of the crowd and argued for a democratic way forward, for the physical force tradition to be abandoned, for a move into political life and to accept that this was the way forward. This was a principled but difficult position, but he was a courageous person.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Friends on the Government side may wish to know that some time in the late 1940s he decided to enter political life to advocate his views. He went to the great founder of Fianna Fáil, Éamon de Valera, for advice on entering political life. Mr. de Valera stated that he had been waiting for Brugha and had been wondering when he was coming to join the party. Brugha stated that he had come for advice but could not join Fianna Fáil when some of his former colleagues were imprisoned. He joined Clann na Poblachta, standing for the party several times before returning to the bosom of Fianna Fáil. He was a Senator, a Deputy and an MEP. Even within Fianna Fáil he was still a bridge builder. At a personal cost to his own political advancement he refused to take sides on any of the various and many schisms within that party. He always attempted to hold both sides together.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">His time as a Deputy, Senator and MEP has been well documented so I will not deal with them. We have been discussing social capital and Oireachtas committees have been examining volunteerism. Ruairí Brugha took action on issues. At one stage the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes money was diverted from hospitals in another direction. The Mater Hospital had extraordinary difficulty seeking money. Brugha founded the famous Mater Hospital pools, which ran for many years. These were bought out some years back but he was still involved in them until relatively recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">For 50 years he was a member of Trees for Ireland. I dealt with him there as a teacher, educationalist and member of the INTO. He carried out significant work in the area and cultivated a love of trees in schools, bringing it into the educational system. He was the first chairperson of Dublin Tourism. More than anything else he was a bridge builder. He was a devout Catholic and a conservative man but he led a delegation to the Archbishop of Armagh looking for the ban on Catholics attending Trinity College to be lifted. It was lifted some time later. He was the type of man who took action.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">He expended a life-long energy in developing good relations among people who were divided, be they from the North and South of this island; Catholic and Protestant from the whole island or in Northern Ireland; or Unionist, Nationalist, republican or loyalist. He always insisted on spending time in Northern Ireland on a regular basis on the process of reconciliation. He did much work on this, which is appreciated. We on the Independent benches wish to be associated with the words spoken previously and we offer condolences to his wife Máire, his family and extended family, who loved him dearly.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Tá sé de phribhléid agam cúpla focal a rá in ómós do Ruairí Brugha. Ní dóigh liom go raibh comhrá aige as Béarla ariamh, agus bhí aithne agam air le beagnach 30 bliain. Tá na focail atá ráite ag gach éinne a labhair anseo go léir fíor ó thaobh an tsaoil pholaitiúla agus stair agus thodhchaí na tíre de. Caithfear a rá chomh maith, áfach, gur duine uasal, séimh, macánta a bhí ann. B'shin iad na rudaí ba mhó a chuaigh i bhfeidhm orm nuair a bhuaileas leis go minic ó thángas anseo i 1981.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">An rud ba mhó ar labhraíomar faoi ná Iarthar Dhuibhneach agus Gaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne agus an draíocht a bhaineann leis an áit sin. Bhí a chlann agus é féin tar éis dul i bhfeidhm ar mhuintir Chorca Dhuibhne, agus bhuaileas le beirt ó Iarthar Dhuibhneach a bhí tar éis teacht go Baile Átha Cliath i gcomhair na sochraide. Sin turas de 250 míle, nach mór. Bhíodar tar éis teacht chun bheith i láthair ag a shochraid. Tá mé an-chairdiúil anois le duine dá chlann. Bhíomar i ngleic lena chéile go mór-mhór san ollscoil nuair a bhí Cathal Óg ina bhall d'Fhianna Fáil. Is féidir a rá nach rabhas féin i mo bhall d'Fhianna Fáil ag an am sin, ach réitíomar níos mó le chéile, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur tionchar dearfach é an tionchar atá ag Clann Brugha ar an dtír seo anois agus mé ag féachaint ar an mbóthar atá amach romhainn agus ag smaoineamh ar na rudaí siúd.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Bhuaileas leis den uair dheiridh roimh an Nollaig, nuair a seoladh leabhar a mhná chéile i gCorcaigh faoi choimirce Ard-Mhéara Chorcaí, Deirdre Clune, iníon de chlann eile de na mór-chlanna i ngluaiseacht na saoirse, Clann de Barra i gCorcaigh. Bhí sé soiléir ansin go raibh Ruairí ag teip agus nár ró-fhada a bheadh sé inár measc. Bhí brón ar gach éinne. Caithfear a thuiscint, áfach, taobh amuigh de sin, agus chomh maith lena uaisleacht agus a mhacántacht, gur dhuine láidir é. Bhí sé pósta le bean láidir a tháinig ó chúlra láidir.</p>

Is cailliúint mhór dóibh é go bhfuil athair na cloinne imithe uatha, mar ba chlann iad a bhí aontaithe faoi gach rud agus an-chúng le chéile. Bhí dearcadh faoi leith ag an gclann go léir ar son síochána, na teangan, thodhchaí na tíre agus Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre.

          <p eId="para_36">On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join with previous speakers in extending our sympathies to the family of the late Ruairí Brugha. It is difficult to speak of an historical icon whom one did not know but having listened to previous speakers, particularly Senator O'Toole's history lesson on the great contribution of the Brugha family to Irish politics, it is clear Ruairí and his father, Cathal, made a great contribution to Irish history and to the evolution of the State we now have. He was a visionary in terms of where we have come to <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland and always promoted his belief in democratic politics. He is quoted as saying of his time in the IRA that it had become the victims of an illusion that would never become a reality. It is fitting to review various stages of our history to learn that there were people who knew what they wanted, knew what was right and had a vision of how to go about it. It is a pity we did not listen more.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Cork people are very proud of the Lord Mayors McSwiney and McCurtain and have much affection for them. The unification of two such historic families by the marriage of Ruairí Brugha and Máire McSwiney compares with anything this country can boast. It is remarkable and something of which we in Cork are proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend our sympathy to his widow and their four children. He was a member of the founding fathers of this State, a Member of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the European Parliament and he contributed to all of them in a dignified, democratic way.</p>

So well spoken were the words of the other speakers that I will not repeat them.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I knew Ruairí Brugha well. He always loved debating a point, no matter what it was, and loved an argument. He had a very good sense of humour and was a very kind man. If he is to be remembered for one thing alone it will be his dedication to resolving the age-old Irish problem by peaceful means, which is what his life was all about</p>
          <p eId="para_41">It was remarkable to see that, at his funeral, his family was not sad but rejoiceful, because they felt he could not have accomplished much more in his life. He had achieved all he wanted, had done so in a quiet, unobtrusive manner and had touched many people, especially in Northern Ireland in recent years. He will be remembered as a man dedicated to peace. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

I was first elected to the Seanad in 1977, a year in which Ruairí Brugha was also elected. There are only two Members in the present Seanad who served with him, namely, Senator Kitt and I. Much of his life was devoted to reconciling the Nationalist and Unionist traditions on the island and bringing about a peaceful end to partition. Though it could be said that he inherited the tradition of physical force republicanism he vigorously promoted the practice of non-violent politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">In the early 1980s he failed to get elected to the Dáil or Seanad and his active role in politics was over. His wife wrote in her recent book, <i>History’s Daughter</i>, that he may have been too idealistic for politics, because he never promoted himself. His only interest was in putting the country first.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_47">After every weekend we wake up to graphic photographs in the national newspapers of mangled cars and human tragedies. So far this year over 50 lives have been lost on our roads. The National Roads Authority has today published a report which is a shocking indictment of what has happened over the past few years. It points out that everybody became ultra-cautious on the roads after the introduction of the penalty points system in November 2002, but that now there is a desperate laxity in the enforcement of the measures and speeding is endemic. The report states conclusively that the vast majority of articulated trucks and buses break the speed limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">We all know that if one travels to Dublin on the motorway at the maximum limit of 120 km/h one sees cars zooming past. Many of them have Northern Irish registrations and 20% of the people caught last year could not be pinpointed because of that. There is a deficiency in our ability to catch those people for breaking the speed limits on our roads and it sets a bad example for other motorists. The British-Irish Council meets on a regular basis and should discuss those issues and come up with a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The Rules of the Road booklet is available in various bookshops around the country, at a cost of €2.50. I spoke to somebody in a bookshop in Limerick this morning and was told an increasing number of eastern Europeans, particularly Polish, ask for the booklet. We go to a lot of trouble ensuring all our publications are translated into the Irish language. In recognition of the immigrant population in this country, who have been involved in many accidents, I suggest we translate Rules of the Road into the relevant languages. If a local newspaper like the <i>Limerick Leader</i> can translate news reports into the languages of the area’s various ethnic communities, it is possible to translate the Rules of the Road. It is not simply a matter of jumping on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, because an interdepartmental group at ministerial level is now responsible for different aspects of road safety. Given that the Taoiseach is in charge of the group, the time for pussy-footing is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The report due to be published today contains a shocking indictment of the current situation. We may have a materialistic society in terms of the Celtic tiger but what about the quality of life? Members of this House have highlighted their concerns on this matter and I too want to see a full debate on the NRA report. Between 2002 and 2005, speeding offences have increased by 800%, yet only three speed cameras have been installed around the country. Almost daily, an accident occurs involving a truck, many of which are in contravention of the rules requiring them to install tachographs to regulate their speed. Urgent action is needed if we are to address this problem in a multi-stranded way. Let us discuss that report in this House so that we can reflect the people's concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Last week, Senator Feighan raised the issue of planning and, in particular, the rejection of a proposal for an eco-friendly development on Lough Key. This issue was also raised on a number of occasions by Senator MacSharry. I ask that we return to No. 13, statements on planning and related issues, because every time I meet people who are trying to put together environmentally sensitive projects intended to bring added value to areas in the west of Ireland, I find they have experienced unnecessary difficulties in terms of developing infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">What is the situation with regard to legislation on major infrastructural projects? We need to address these issues in a manner that is fair to the environment, the people and the need for proper development of rural communities. Vague reasons are often given for the designation of special areas of conservation and it is not always understandable why some areas are treated differently from others. It is right that some areas are protected by strict rules but we would have more confidence in the system if these rules were made clear. Given that An Bord Pleanála often holds different views from those outlined in the various county development plans, how can ordinary people negotiate the planning system? It is blocking development and denuding aspects of the west of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">——NRA reports on breaches of speed limits by heavy goods vehicles. This is a serious matter. The NRA reported that 100% of single-decker buses on motorways and 90% of trucks and rigid vehicles were in breach of the speed limit. The average speed of heavy goods vehicles was 53 mph in the second last survey, even though they are not supposed to be able to travel faster than 55 mph because of the way in which they are constructed. In light of this crisis, I do not ask for a debate on road safety, although that is always necessary, but on the NRA report on speed limits. I have repeatedly raised these issues with Ministers and received their replies but I cannot find out the numbers of prosecutions of truck drivers for breaking speed limits. Neither the Garda nor the Department of Transport knows the answer. The report, which is extremely frightening, suggests that while car drivers on main roads and motorways are improving, everybody else is becoming worse, spectacularly so in some cases. We need to focus on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">I also ask the Leader to organise a debate on immigration. When this matter was rightly raised by my party leader, he was called a number of names for doing so. We all now accept the need to work on the issues of integration, workers' rights, wage degradation and job displacement. Bank economists have issued mealy-mouthed claims that these issues have not been proven, which is as close as one can get to declaring a problem exists without actually saying so. We need to debate these matters, not in order to show hostility to immigrants, who are welcome, but to ensure them the Irish standards of living to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">In terms of looking to the future, I draw the House's attention to an article in today's newspapers. The Swedish Government has established a committee which will plan for Sweden's transformation to an oil-free economy over the next 15 years because it has decided there is no future in the oil-based economy. We do not seem to be able to deal with simple matters such as water or air pollution yet another country, which we should emulate in terms of its combination of social progress and economic development, is planning how to move away from a dependence on oil. We will probably collide with the crisis without giving thought to it. I concur with Senator Finucane's demand for a debate on energy, during which the Government could discuss its strategy over the next 15 years to deal with the imminent shortage and escalating costs of hydrocarbon fuels.</p>

It is perfectly legitimate for the authority to appoint an advisory group but to set the finality of the decision before that group advises is scandalous. I admit I am completely biased because there are two group hotels in my constituency and I recognise the important part they have played in the development of tourism in Ireland. Were it not for the Corrib Great Southern Hotel developing the biggest conference centre in the west, there would be no conference business in Galway. I appeal to the Leader for a debate, if not today then tomorrow so that we can consider the best strategy. It is not appropriate to simply dump the family silver for short-term commercial gain.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I support Senator Cox in her request for an urgent debate on the Great Southern Hotels issue. In recent years, all members in this House have voiced their concerns about the lack of access to specialist health care in all parts of the country. They have drawn attention to the unacceptable delays and long waiting lists for such care. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today clearly indicates that there is a need for co-operation between private and public health care providers. Such co-operation does not exist, particularly in the western Health Service Executive area. It is galling, to say the least, to see that for services such as radiotherapy, cardiology and orthopaedics, where there are long waiting lists, people must go from Galway to Dublin, England, Scotland or Belfast to access such specialist therapies, despite the fact that the Galway Clinic has offered 20% of its bed capacity to the public sector. That offer has been ignored and the clinic is being bypassed.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">We cannot say that funding is the difficulty because last year €200 million was returned by the Department of Health and Children to the Exchequer. In the last two months of 2005 approximately 200 people passed the doors of the Galway Clinic on their way to obtain treatment in England. How can we say that we have co-operation within the health service, particularly in the west, where access is a real problem? The waiting time for access to radiotherapy services in St. Luke's in Dublin is ten to 12 weeks but we have a state-of-the-art facility in Galway which is being bypassed. Every effort was made by the authorities in the Galway Clinic to co-operate with the HSE, during the planning, construction and administration phases of the project but this was cast aside and ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Health and Children would knock heads together to ensure that the HSE and those who are offering valuable services to those in need in the west co-operate with each other. The Minister herself must take some of the blame for this problem. Senator McHugh has on several occasions asked for co-operation between the HSE northern area and the authorities in Northern Ireland with regard to facilities that might be available in Derry. However, the Minister decided that she would provide access to services, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland health services, in Belfast. Why was Galway ignored? I urge the Leader to request that the Minister for Health and Children carries out an urgent review of co-operation between the HSE and private sector health service providers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_72">I echo the sentiments of Senator Cox and would welcome a debate on the future of the Great Southern Hotels. Such a debate is long overdue. Only 18 months ago these Houses gave a remit to the airport authorities to compete independently of each other. The Dublin Airport Authority has now set out its stall on where it wishes to go. Its core business is in developing Dublin Airport to meet the demands of over 1 million new passengers per year, including building a new terminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The 2 million workers in this country would be amused by the notion that this or any Government would be involved in running hotels. It is outlandish that a premium brand like the Great Southern Hotels, in premium locations, should be making a loss. The Government does not want to be the parent of an unwanted child, allowing it to wilt and eventually be put up for a fire sale. It is now time that this unhealthy flower be allowed bloom in the sunshine of a thriving economy.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_74">I support Senators Finucane and Ryan in their call for a debate on road safety, particularly in light of the NRA report. Senator Finucane is correct regarding the Northern Ireland situation. It should be quite an easy matter of adjustment to make it possible to include Northern-registered cars in our penalty points system. That is a very good, practical suggestion. There are also improvements that can be made domestically and locally. One of the reasons speed limits are not respected and are broken is that they are chaotic and incoherent. They do not deserve respect. There are motorways where speed limits change for arbitrary and capricious reasons, for example, and that reduces public respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">There is also the issue of road surfaces. There were two desperately tragic incidents recently, one where a bright and talented young woman was killed in the west because the road surface laid by the local authority was flawed, the other where a school bus crashed for the same reason. We have our own house to put in order. In Germany, for example, driving lessons are a compulsory part of the school curriculum and that is something we should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Senator Ryan also raised the question of immigration, which has become a thorny point in light of the new child care benefits. I spoke on child care in this House and was a dissenting voice among the chorus of demands for more money for parents. I made the point that there was a certain amount of sentimentality at play, as well as vote-buying. Today's newspapers report that queries to the Department regarding the new child care payment of €1,000, have increased from 20 per week to 200. Approximately 90% of the callers were Irish and the overwhelming majority wanted to know if the payment would coincide with the holiday period. I wonder how much the children will see of the €1,000 payment. This shows a level of materialism and selfishness in our society. I said as much during the last debate and was howled down in the Chamber. Then I went to the bar afterwards for coffee and my colleagues told me that I was right but they would not dare say so.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">We have spoken recently about the issue of censorship in the light of controversial cartoons and so forth. We must also examine censorship in this country with regard to advertising for events, particularly of a political nature. I have received communication from people who had an advertisement broadcast once on RTE 1 radio. The advertisement itself was simple. It stated that AFrI and Front Line — two reputable organisations — were inviting the public to a conference entitled Shining Lights on Human Rights, at the Féile Bríde in Kildare town, featuring eyewitness accounts from the Niger Delta, Rossport, Darfur, Iraq and Shannon Airport. It went on to state that tickets and information were available by calling a particular telephone number. The advertisement was pulled because it was deemed to be political. That is too politically correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I recently attended the launch of a book called <i>Guantanamo Jihad</i>, held in the former St. Mary’s Church, now a restaurant, on Mary Street in Dublin. The launch was moved from Kilmainham Jail because the authorities there were unhappy about the fact that some of the attendees would be wearing orange uniforms, similar to those worn by detainees in Guantanamo. Kilmainham Jail is one of our State operations. We should not close down political debate. There are difficulties because pressure groups would want to put blunt political messages across. However, to pull advertisements for a meeting is an over-reaction. Citizens are entitled to information and we should examine this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Following on the point made by Senator Finucane on the high percentage of Northern drivers, as someone living in the north west in a Border region, I know first hand how Northern drivers flaunt the law. It is as if they are giving two fingers to people in this jurisdiction. They drive at unmercifully high speed in a dangerous and reckless fashion. I have raised this at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and I raised it again two weeks ago in this House. I hope the issue will be raised in Killarney at Easter because now is an opportune time. It would not take much to bring them within the legislative framework of this jurisdiction.</p>

I have been expressing concern about the group for some time and on every occasion, and very firmly on the last occasion, the Leader assured me that the best guarantee the group had was the rock solid view of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism that it would remain in State ownership. The matter came before Cabinet yesterday. Has the green light now been given to a sale? That is the message that came across last night and this morning. We are aware of the views of the Dublin Airport Authority, which should never have been entrusted with the ownership of the group.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_33">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_86">I will outline a snapshot of what appeared in the newspapers over the weekend: terror attacks, a man attacked at home, an armed robbery, theft and burglaries under investigation, bicycles stolen, an armed gang robbed a shop owner, an attempted car theft, a house ransacked, a windscreen smashed, a pier damaged, windows smashed, a vehicle broken into, cinema theft, an attempted break in, the theft of a home-made trailer, a car burnt out, a house broken into, a rural pub burgled again, an architects office targeted and a shooting of a young man.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">This is not an international snapshot, we are not talking about the Gaza Strip or a major city, we are talking about Donegal. These stories appeared in the local newspapers in Donegal last weekend detailing activities within a seven-day period. These incidents are mainly happening in Border areas of the county. It is evident that the gardaí in the region are underresourced. I have mentioned before that we are situated beside the fourth largest city in Ireland, Derry, and we do not take that into consideration when deploying Garda resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must address this issue. People are living in fear and do not feel safe in their own homes. We must do something about it. We are enacting legislation that will criminalise farmers and fishermen for minor misdemeanours while 29% of crime in Donegal is undetected. If we do not do something about this, people will take the law into their own hands in Border areas and we do not want that to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on planning, with particular emphasis on the approach taken by prescribed organisations, such as the NRA. At the moment the NRA is objecting to people who are trying to build off national secondary roads. This causes untold anxiety for young couples who fail to get planning permission on their own land because the only access is via national secondary roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">We must also focus on Dúchas, which has not gone away. It objects to special areas of conservation and national heritage areas. It even objects to proposed areas that have not yet been prescribed, creating significant difficulties. There are many areas around Lough Derg and in west and north County Clare where it is objecting to projects based on environmentally-friendly approaches.</p>

It has noted the Dublin Airport Authority's decision to sell the Great Southern Hotels. It is the first time in the history of the State that the Government has noted anything as an official policy. It is important that we have an early indication of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">There was a very strange statement from a Government spokesman last night who said that the Government's attitude is that it will not immediately block this decision. That means it will block it later on. It has set up the most obvious method of blocking anything by sending the matter to a group of advisers. Advisers are not necessary when deciding whether to sell the Great Southern Hotels. Let us have a debate rather than an ideological approach to the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come before the House for a debate on the roll-out of broadband to the regions. In its programme for Government in the run-up to the last general election, the Government highlighted the fact that it would be in a position to roll out broadband to the regions by 2006. The lack of progress in this regard is stifling development in rural areas and there is widespread discontent at the lack of interest the Government has shown in rolling out broadband to the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I request an urgent debate on this issue because chambers of commerce, industrialists, farming organisations and many others with an interest in the development of rural areas feel let down by the Government's lack of interest in this area. One need only talk to people who have served on the Midland Regional Authority to sense how badly let down by the Government they feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The quality of our regional and county roads was raised. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to the House to take part in a debate on funding for local authorities.

The problem with the National Treatment Purchase Fund is that it does not disclose what it is paying for various procedures, whether carried out in England, Belfast, Dublin or elsewhere.

          <p eId="para_123">Senator Finucane, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, spoke passionately about the facts outlined in the NRA report. He made a good point that the Rules of the Road booklet is printed in English only, which is indicative of our view that everyone should speak English. It would be good if the booklet were translated into Polish, as is the case with reports in the <i>Limerick Leader</i>. The NRA report is a wake-up call. The problem of lorries overtaking cars on the road, which all of us have experienced, has been discussed in the House for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Senator O'Toole called for a debate on planning and asked when a Bill will be introduced on major infrastructural projects. The legislation in question features in section A of the Government's list of Bills for publication during this session. The Senator also seeks a debate on energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I join Senator Ryan in noting the death of Coretta Scott King, a woman of peace who could easily have become a bitter person given the manner of her husband's death. He also raised the NRA report on breaches of speed limits and seeks debates on immigration and the Swedish Government's decision to establish a committee to plan for the country's transformation into an oil-free economy over the next 15 years. Shivers run down our spines when we hear people refer to the diminishing role of oil. Its importance will not diminish but its price will rise so high that no one will be able to purchase it.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The Senator also asked when the House would debate legislation. We have pushed many Bills through the House and they are piled up in the Dáil, which is not dealing with them. I cannot force the other House to do its business. There is no way it will get through all the Bills waiting to be taken and if the Seanad processes further Bills, they will be added to the pile. We are trying to have decent debates. I wish the Dáil would do its business but it engages in much toing and froing, which often means legislation is not coped with. The Bill on the National, Social and Economic Development Office has just been passed in the Dáil and will be taken here next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator Cox raised the issue of the Great Southern Hotels. She said they have a history of tourism development and that we should not sell the family silver. Senator Ulick Burke spoke about lack of access to specialist health care, particularly to radiotherapy and cardiac treatment for which people have to travel considerable distances. He asked why Galway is ignored and requested that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House. Senator Morrissey also called for a debate on the Great Southern Hotels. He said the group owns a premium brand and should be performing powerfully in economic terms. Speaking on "Morning Ireland" Senator Morrissey took the view that the Cabinet had made the decision, but it has not.</p>

        <heading>Strategy for Men’s Health: Statements (Resumed).</heading>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_192">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. It is somewhat confusing as I have been spread out like Marmite over the past few days. I was talking about prostate cancer, which is a serious problem accounting for almost 25% of male cancers. There has been an apparent significant increase in the incidence in the past ten or 15 years. That is partly related to higher rates of detection. It is very much to be welcomed, in particular the prostate specific antigen, PSA, test. This is a blood test taken once a year. I do it. It is very useful and all men in my age group, which is 60 plus, should take it because apart from anything else, this cancer has a tendency to increase in manifestation as one gets older. It is clearly age related. Very few cases are registered in men under 50. More than 60% of the cases occur in men over 70 years old and the largest number of cases diagnosed were in the 70 to 74 and the 75 to 79 age groups. Worldwide, 650,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. That is an indication of the significance of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The figures for Ireland are worrying. The latest figures I have show that in the totality of Europe, we are third highest in the mortality league. That is something that should worry all of us, particularly because there have been news reports on the matter and new information appears to be coming in all the time. Since I last spoke I have read newspaper reports which indicate that very little, proportionally, is spent on research into prostate cancer. That is something the Minister could examine profitably.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">If we compare the shining example of women, who have had a campaign about breast cancer and research into breast cancer, although the incidence of these two cancers — one related almost entirely to women and the other exclusively to men — is very similar, breast cancer research is given five times the amount of money. I approve of money spent on research into breast cancer but a proportionate amount should also be spent on research into this form of cancer, which affects males only. Since 2000, €1.76 million has been invested in breast cancer research in Ireland while in the same period only €0.35 million was spent on research into prostate cancer. Our medical teaching hospitals and the medical faculties of our universities have had significant success in research into cures for illness. In my university, for example, one of my very distinguished colleagues was involved in the discovery of a cure for leprosy. A significant advance has been made in the treatment of blindness, retinitis pigmentosa. Comparatively small amounts of money spent on this kind of research can yield results that have a significant effect on people's health. In addition to the education campaigns, which I fully support, money must be put into research.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I would like to return to the question of the difference between men and women in terms of the way in which they regard their own health. Women regularly examine themselves; men do not. That is very important, particularly in terms of conditions such as testicular cancer, something about which we have heard virtually nothing. There was a veil of silence over this area and I would like to pay tribute to people like Ferdia MacAnna, who is a very popular figure in the entertainment world. He developed this cancer and wrote about it both in book form in his autobiography and also in mass circulation newspapers. That took a good deal of courage and it is something we should be grateful for because it alerted men to the possibility of this cancer, the need to be aware of changes in that area of the body including lumps and so on and to get early treatment because this form of cancer, like many others, is amenable to treatment if it is found early. Unfortunately, many men who find changes in the testicular area or a lump are embarrassed. They do not want to go to the doctor and ask about it. We ought to maintain an education programme to try to get rid of that false sense of shame because they will be much more worried, shamed and scared if they find themselves in a situation where they have to have radical surgery in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Broadening out the debate on men's health somewhat, there is the question of the alcohol culture. I had a long argument with a friend of mine who is not from Ireland. He maintained that alcohol was part of the Irish culture. That is a very curious definition of "culture", particularly when one considers the way in which we drink. I do not believe in restricting people or playing the old granny in Irish society but young people should be educated about the dangers of alcohol and in that regard we should look at the drinks industry, which has a massive and extremely effective lobby. If we are serious about the health of our population, and specifically young men because they are disproportionately affected — the young are particularly affected — we should examine the way they are targeted by the drinks industry to encourage them to drink, particularly the question of sports sponsorship and so on. The Government had a report which indicated that sponsorship and advertisements for alcohol should be banned, particularly where it related to sport. The Government has not acted on that and if it is serious about health and men's health, that should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Suicide is a very severe problem in this country. Whereas it is always tragic when somebody takes his or her own life, there is a disproportionate concentration of figures at the lower end of the age spectrum. Once again, if one refines the examination further one will find a disproportionate number of young males commit suicide. We need to examine that and get some facts and figures. We have them, for example, for the United Kingdom and the North but we do not have any detailed figures. It would be useful if the Minister would ask for a report on what lies behind these suicides. I would say part of it is because of the changing role of men in society. Many young men are confused because they are getting conflicting messages. The alpha male syndrome, the idea of the man as a hunter-gatherer and so on, has been changed in a very positive direction but young men do not have the clearly defined role model they had previously and a number of them find that confusing.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Underneath that there is the question of sexuality. Despite the fact that we are bombarded as a society by sexually explicitly advertising and programmes to a degree that I, now that I am in my 60s, find astonishing, the level of intelligent sexual awareness has not increased and the Government has a responsibility in that regard in terms of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">One of the most significant aspects is that in terms of bullying patterns in schools, for example, a total of 90% of bullying incidents included some degree of anti-gay message. That is an astonishing figure yet almost none of the schools has taken on board a fully comprehensive sexual education programme. I am not suggesting the promotion, for example, of alternative lifestyles or——</p>

          <p eId="para_202">There is a serious point to be made, namely, it would be useful if a mutual information pack about sexuality was available and classes were conducted in this area. That would give some reassurance to the 10% minority of school children who will inevitably turn out to be gay.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I apologise that the Minister of State was kept waiting for such a long time outside the Chamber but it was not just because of the extended Order of Business. It was also because we were paying tribute to a beloved former colleague in this House, the late Senator Ruairí Brugha.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">We were talking about road safety on the Order of Business, among other issues. I pointed out, as others have, that there is an opportunity to give young people driving lessons within the school context. Questions have been raised about insurance and responsibility, etc., but I am sure these matters can be sorted out because in Germany this is a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Imagine the impact this might have on the incidence of fatalities. I do not have the exact figures, but a high proportion of the people killed at weekends are young males who sometimes are on their own. There is even the suggestion that in a proportion of these cases, the accidents are not entirely accidental. This is a way some young people have of ending their own lives and it is very tragic.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_205">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am very glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issue of men's health. In the executive summary of the report, entitled Getting Inside Men's Health, there is a reference to the fact that the predominant players in decision making are men. However, they do not lobby or campaign or argue on the issue of men's health to the same extent, for example, as women do. It is not always useful to make comparisons between men and women as regards health. It is, however, significant that the figures show Irish men die six years younger on average compared to Irish women. Obviously there are other issues as regards accidents, suicide and the potential for self-harm which reveal pronounced gender differences in mortality trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">As well as the differences between men and women there are also differing trends among men as regards health. Much of what we see in sport currently indicates that macho characteristics are uppermost, with people taking risks they should not. This is worrying. In the television programme "Jackass", people are dared to become involved in some very risky adventures. This is the type of programme which should come with a health warning, because of its display of macho culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The question of the school curriculum is interesting. There is very little in the school curriculum at any level as regards men's health. The general reaction from young people is to say they will worry about such matters in 20 or 30 years. As young people they believe they should not have to worry about an issue such as health. That promotes its own type of culture, with people, for example, opting not to visit a doctor. The reluctance of men to see a doctor is highlighted consistently in all the different reports and reviews I have read. There may be some way to make GP services more male-friendly. In County Galway it has been possible for medical group practices to introduce rotas, for example, where people can have more access to a GP. Men, in particular, do not like sitting in a doctor's waiting room. Without being sexist, they dislike sitting in waiting areas with women and children. There are, perhaps, ways in which this problem can be overcome and many group practices are trying to accommodate easier access to the doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I raised the question of public alcohol centres on the Order of Business this morning. I know the House is discussing mental health tomorrow, but the question of public units is something we should debate. I have made the point that we have excellent private centres, which are, however, very expensive and would require patients to have adequate insurance cover. However, there was a unit in St. Brigid's psychiatric hospital in Ballinasloe which facilitated overnight accommodation, and such a facility is normally required for the treatment of patients suffering from the effects of binge drinking. At a time when we have extra alcohol counsellors, I cannot understand why people cannot be taken out of their normal environment, if only for a short period, and treated in such units. That was the way in the past, and unfortunately, we appear to be going backwards by no longer having such public residential units for the treatment of such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Closely related to this is the question of depression. Not enough is being done to help men, in particular, suffering from depression. Additional counsellors have been appointed to tend to the needs of affected families and there is talk of community counsellors being available. Again, however, people often need to be taken out of their immediate environment, in the same way as those with chronic alcohol problems should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">A positive aspect to the report is that smoking has reduced by 26%, indicating a downward trend in the consumption of tobacco among Irish men. Smoking is still a considerable health issue, nonetheless, which has a knock-on effect on other areas. However, it is good to see the downward trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Another issue in the report relates to sports people and physical activity. It indicates that many people, when ceasing to be active in sports, fail to take up any other physical activities, and this can lead to health problems. It is an issue that should also be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Senator Norris and others referred to testicular cancer. As we know, this area presents a particular difficulty for men, and more research should be done on it. I sat on the former Western Health Board for five years, where we used to hear a good deal about it. In addition, male doctors on the board would talk about the real problems of men with prostate cancer who experienced a very poor quality of life. The current notion that men should have various blood tests and examinations by doctors in this regard is very welcome, and much progress is being made although there should be more research into this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">There is also the issue of obesity and people being overweight. This area should be tackled further by the Department of Health and Children. There are figures in this report with which I do not agree, or perhaps I do not understand them, regarding whether married men are healthier than their single counterparts and so on. I agree, however, with its comments as regards fatherhood and the findings that men are, perhaps, more responsible while caring for their children's health. It dawns on them that they have a responsibility towards their children and makes them want to "grow up with them" as opposed to having a poor quality of life as parents. That is an important point. Whereas in the past only mothers brought the children to the doctor, that might change in the future as men take more responsibility for their own and their children's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Many men's groups have highlighted the need for time off from employment, given that some fathers — the figure is 90%, according to the report Getting Inside Men's Health — have never availed themselves of parental leave. I welcome the fact that the situation is changing, but it appears that a lot of ground needs to be made up. It is interesting that, following the latest budget, there was a lot more discussion about parental leave for both mothers and fathers.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">One simple recommendation in the Getting Inside Men's Health report that interests me is the suggestion of a helpline that men could phone if they have a question about cancer. We already have an international men's health week and a men's cancer week but men have said they would like to be able to get more information. A helpline would be very welcome. I also welcome the report's recommendation that more people should challenge the macho drinking culture and that efforts should be made to encourage people to quit smoking or to reduce the amount they smoke. Other recommendations concern the need to tackle obesity and the culture of taking risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Finally, I welcome Senator Norris's suggestion that the number of young men involved in car accidents might be tackled if lessons about driving were provided at second level. As I have mentioned on previous occasions, the suggestion should be considered, especially for the transition year in second level school. The driving programme devised by Rosemary Smith, who we all know was a great rally driver in her day, is already being used in some schools. That is a welcome development. All the shock and horror television advertisements showing the most dreadful accidents seem to have failed, so it is time we taught people the rules of the road, perhaps during the transition year in second level schools. That would lead to a better situation regarding how young men behave on the road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this discussion on men's health. Over the years the issue has been obscured, so I welcome the fact that it is at last beginning to be put at the top of the agenda and I thank the Minister of State for his co-operation on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">For years we had a macho society and a drink culture in which a man was not considered a man until he could drink ten pints and a few whiskeys and smoke a few cigarettes. Football matches, weddings, christenings and birthday parties were all occasions during which the drink culture and its associated diet, which was not exactly the best, were evident. Over the years many people died because they just did not know anything different from that culture. Although my father often enjoyed a pint of Guinness, perhaps the main thing that saved him — he lived to an elderly age — was that he did not drink shorts. I worry that shorts are beginning to be accepted by younger people. They are perhaps a modern thing, but whereas a pint of Guinness or a pint or bottle of beer will not do much harm to the liver, half a bottle of whiskey a day will ensure that a man will not survive into a ripe old age unless he is very fortunate. I am worried that we are now moving into a culture of shorts and hard liquor. We need to consider that issue seriously. However, people are now more aware of what happens, whereas the drink culture of previous generations killed off many adult men over the decades — perhaps up until the 1970s — because they simply did not know any better.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Diet is another issue, much of which is centred around the drink culture whereby people eat fast foods, such as the chicken snack box or batter burger, which are not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. I remember a friend telling me of what happened when my grandfather went to the doctor about 40 years ago. At that time the staple diet in every house in the country involved the use of the frying pan for breakfast, dinner and team, where all cooking was done using fat and lard. People were so used to the frying pan that when the doctor told my grandfather, "James, what you need to do now is go home and throw out the frying pan", my grandfather replied, "If we throw out the frying pan, what will we eat?" It is great to see things have changed since then, as we are not now as reliant on the frying pan as we used to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">One issue that does not revolve around the public house is the breakfast roll. As the celebrated song by the comedian Pat Shortt mentions, the breakfast roll involves "Two eggs, two rashers, two sausages, two puddin'— one black, one white". However, I believe the jumbo breakfast roll will prove to be a serious issue. Although it might be great when people are young and working on a building site — when they drive to work, they just pull into a forecourt — but the body cannot continue to take that. The breakfast roll contains enough fat and calories for the whole day. If we do not stop, we will move much closer to the situation in the United States, where the widespread use of Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's mean that obesity is a major issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Over the past ten years, the average weight of people has increased by 10lbs because of such convenience foods. We are not paying enough attention to the contents of food and to food labelling. Convenience foods may be great when people are young, when their lifestyle allows them to fight off those effects, but when people get to a certain age they cannot continue with such diets. Poor diet can present as serious a health risk as smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Physical activity is excellent and a great help to health, so perhaps more could be done to encourage people to take it up. I have always said that one cannot beat a walk in the morning. Many men have now taken up walking, whereas ten years ago men would have been involved only in football or rugby and, when they retired from that, would have ended all physical activity apart from perhaps a game of golf. I would encourage people to take up walking but the Government could also help by, for example, ensuring that any bypass that is built includes lights and footpaths to allow people to walk in safety. On many country roads with poor lighting some walkers wear fluorescent jackets but some continue to take their lives in their hands. However, the poor unfortunate driver who knocks them down also has cause to worry.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The smoking ban was a welcome move for our pub culture. It actually highlights how many men and women are dying unnecessarily as a result of over-indulgence in tobacco. It was all very fine over the years because when one passed pubs one never saw the people who were dying inside them. Now, one can see them outside smoking. When one passes a pub one will see withered young men who are in their 30s and 40s but who look to be in their 50s and 60s. This is a result of addiction to alcohol and cigarettes. It is a lifestyle about which people should be better informed, although much has been done in this regard. I enjoy that lifestyle myself so I cannot say much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">We often discuss the incidence of suicide among young men. For too long we did not know what to say about this issue and politicians did not know what to do about it. Young men do not talk to each other if they have a problem. I attended a seminar on depression and asked what one should do about this. In political life one meets many people in our offices and constituencies, especially young men, who are so stressed and depressed that one is often fearful they might commit suicide. One does not know what to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">There is a family life centre in my constituency which is a great support. I can phone counsellors and arrange to put people in contact with them. It is a great resource for a politician because we do not know what to say. Sometimes, however, when one meets somebody in that condition it can be useful to ask them if they are suicidal. It can help to get through to them. This is an important issue for politicians because we encounter these situations all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">There is much talk about the incidence of prostate and testicular cancer. These issues have still not been addressed. Men do not visit the doctor as often as they should. Perhaps it is time to consider a scheme whereby a doctor would visit football clubs, IFA meetings and other venues where men congregate and encourage them to visit the doctor. Men tend to be lazy and not to watch what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is good that the incidence of smoking among men has decreased. This will help men's health. There is also the issue of stress. Today I drove to Dublin from Roscommon. I left at 7.50 a.m. and reached Lucan at 9.20 a.m. but did not get into town until 10.50 a.m. I am very stressed. God help anybody who must make that journey every day because I am stressed after doing it this morning. We must do something about our roads network and provide a better transport network so people can get to work on time. I accept that much has been done, as the Minister would say, but there is a great deal more to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">We are becoming more aware of the issue of men's health. It is no longer a taboo subject. Prevention is always better than cure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KateWalsh" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_229">I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. Rather than address the wider issue, I will focus on the specific issue of diabetes. I refer Members to the extensive contribution made by my party colleague two weeks ago for an excellent, wider consideration of men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I have had diabetes for over 30 years and I believe I have managed it well. It is estimated that there are 250,000 diabetics in Ireland, nine out of ten of whom have type 2 diabetes. If current trends continue, it is predicted that by 2015 one third of all men in Ireland will face increased risk of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes must not be considered a future concern but a current problem. It is a critical and growing dilemma which must be addressed. I welcome the strategy for men's health; men with diabetes will benefit from it. However, the Diabetes Federation of Ireland has highlighted the need for a national diabetes strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">While approximately 250,000 people in Ireland have diabetes, it should be noted that approximately 100,000 people with diabetes are currently undiagnosed. I have reason to mention undiagnosed diabetes because I sometimes meet people who mention various symptoms, such as that their eyes are giving them trouble. I advise them to get checked for diabetes. A limited amount of knowledge is not ideal but it is a help. I noted with particular interest a recent appearance by Ronan Collins on "The Late Late Show". He revealed that he only discovered he was a diabetic when his general practitioner observed him consuming large quantities of cola when they were out playing golf.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is agreed that men are poor when it comes to getting themselves checked out for medical problems. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes is the primary cause of heart disease, kidney disease, lower limb amputations and blindness among people under 65 years of age. We must convey the message to men that they must have their health checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Many contributors to the debate two weeks ago referred to the lifestyle issues that are particular to men and the impact they have on their health. Men must check whether there is a family history of diabetes and take note of their levels of physical activity. They must understand that the likelihood of their developing diabetes increases with age. We must ensure that the general population, and men in particular because they are slow to have their health checked, take note of the risk factors. A simple blood test will detect diabetes. The tragedy is that people fail to get that blood test even though it can bring them back to good health when they learn how to manage their diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">A further 100,000 people have pre-diabetes. If this is detected, it can be stabilised to prevent progression to diabetes. Earlier diagnosis of diabetics will mean fewer eye and cardiac problems, fewer limb amputations and less incidence of renal failure. It will also deliver cost savings for the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Not enough credit is given to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children for her work on this issue. She has clearly stated her concern and commitment to dealing with this problem. She has correctly acknowledged that the challenge in health now is to manage chronic illnesses in the community. In 2002, a total of 3,000 people entered the acute hospital system suffering from diabetes; in 2004, it was 4,000, an increase of 33%. The Tánaiste has stated that the most appropriate way to manage illnesses is at community level. This is why a major focus of the negotiations with doctors is on the management of chronic illnesses at primary care level. I congratulate the Tánaiste on her initiative in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_236">I am delighted this debate is taking place. In particular, Senator Glynn, who has promoted this debate for some time, should be congratulated. I am pleased that Senator Kate Walsh spoke about diabetes, which has been discussed by other Senators. I am president of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland so I am very concerned about the figures cited by Senator Kate Walsh about the increase in the number of diabetics who have been diagnosed. It is almost impossible to deal with them so I do not know how we would cope if diabetics who are currently undiagnosed were diagnosed with the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">It is important to introduce the obesity strategy as quickly as possible because it is very important for men and women. I am disappointed with the rate of progress in this regard. Since the election of the Government in 1997, there has been an incredible increase in the percentage of the adult population who are obese. In 1997, the percentage was 9% but it is now approximately 18%. This represents an increase of approximately 10% per year. I am doubtful if this will go down as one of the achievements of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">It is important to encourage people to take exercise even if they are overweight. Walking keeps blood sugar levels down to a considerable degree, even if one is overweight. Public awareness campaigns of this kind are worthwhile. I recently read a paper about the value of exercise in keeping blood pressure down in men. It revealed that 20 minutes of moderate cycling three times per week was as effective over the course of two weeks as a considerable amount of medication in lowering blood pressure. We must promote these solutions, which are very simple and could make a considerable difference to the nation's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I am very fond of advertisements seen in London which use slogans like "Stairs — they are your friends" which encourage people to use stairs instead of lifts. Another advertisement's slogan was "Fear the pie" and featured a picture of a pie that looked as if it would engulf the viewer if he or she ate it. More public awareness measures along these lines would do no harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Cancer statistics have not been mentioned and are, unfortunately, associated with obesity. Some of these statistics are worrying because we could do more about detecting such cancers early, particularly colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer of the digestive tract and it was thought for many years that if it could be detected earlier, there would be a better outcome in respect of treating it. We have found this to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Many European countries have pilot screening programmes, if not full screening programmes, for the detection of faecal occult blood. This test is cheap and easy to carry out. The patient is given the papers which with to conduct the test. I will not describe the details of how the patient collects the faeces sample to test it for occult blood. The samples are sent to a laboratory through the patient's doctor over a three-day period. If the test is positive, the patient is offered a sigmoidoscopy. It is frequently possible to detect these cancers at a precancerous stage when they are called adenomas. In many cases, these adenomas can be removed in a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Early detection is, therefore, extremely important in preventing the development of cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I raised the issue of screening programmes on the Adjournment some years ago and hoped that, at least, a pilot scheme would have been introduced. However, this has not happened. The Minister of State should examine the matter. Unfortunately, it frequently happens that a person with these cancers begins to feel miserable, goes to his or her doctor, is found to have anaemia, the anaemia is investigated and it is discovered that he or she has cancer which must be treated with a major operation. It is also possible that such people would have secondary cancers. It would be a good idea if we tried to introduce such a screening programme because colorectal cancer is one of the worst killers in this country. Given the existence of such a simple test for it, I hope the Minister would promote such a screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">We still do not have a population register, the lack of which makes any screening programme less effective than it should be because an exact age cohort that could be brought forward each time is unavailable. Perhaps work could also be carried out in this area. I have raised the issue ever since I entered the Seanad but there has been no progress on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I compliment all the speakers in today's debate because a great deal of sense has been spoken. Those speakers who argued that men are not good at looking after their health are correct. Men are not particularly enthusiastic about visiting their GPs, a situation we wish to change.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_245">I never cease to be amazed at the collective wisdom that exists in this House. I mentioned to a few Senators over the past few days that it is very pleasant to have debates where people feel they are not forced to defend a particular position or promote a particular motion tabled by a party, but can speak from their own experience, research and understanding of life. This debate on men's health has presented such an opportunity. Much of the debate has been very thought-provoking and many constructive proposals have been made. I thank Senators from all sides of the House for the way in which they debated the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Certain issues were raised by a number of Senators. This has been a protracted debate and this is the third day on which we have tried to deal with the issue. Senator Browne argued that policy on men's health should not focus solely on disease but on the wider determinants of health. He called for the introduction of a men's health week in June 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">A number of speakers mentioned the high suicide rate in Ireland, which is the second highest among OECD states. However, we now have a dedicated suicide strategy which, when implemented, will address the issue and we will hopefully see a major reduction in the incidence of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Sudden adult death was also raised during the debate. A report on this issue has been commissioned, which is expected to be published in the near future. Senator Glynn suggested that this debate take place and participated in it. A number of other speakers spoke about the reluctance of men to address their health and their tendency to ignore it. It is sometimes stated that ignorance is bliss but nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to one's health. A small measure of education in this regard would go a long way. It is important that men give their health the attention it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The emphasis must be on early detection. If a person has a problem, there is no point in him or her ignoring it. Statistics and experience show that there is a far better chance of success and a return to good health and a normal and fulfilling life if problems are identified early and dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I think today was the third time that Senator Norris attempted to tell us about his experience and it was interesting to hear him share it. He experienced a particular problem during a procedure he was undergoing. As Senator Norris stated, it is a problem that only arises once in every 3,000 cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Anybody familiar with Senator Norris would realise that he is not an everyday person and would be regarded by many as one in a million. It is not unusual that he has stood up, produced evidence and shared the experience of his case. He mentioned the necessity for research on prostate health. It is an area that should be considered, and men should be encouraged to check themselves on a more regular basis. Women do so regularly, but men seldom do so. It is important to change this and encourage men to be more aware of their health and the need for regular checks.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Senator Feighan mentioned that prevention is better than cure, and that is true with regard to health. Senator Kate Walsh referred to diabetes and it is important to point out that if people have the courage to go for a simple blood test it can transform their lives. People could then manage the disease reasonably well if they find they have it, and could go on to lead normal lives again. It is important to encourage this.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I appreciate the expertise of Senator Henry in this area and welcome her comments on the matter. With regard to obesity, a task force on the matter has been launched, and a number of recommendations were contained in its report. All of these do not necessarily require large amounts of money to be spent, and many relate to changing lifestyles. We have provided €3 million in the Estimates for this year which will be used to implement a number of the recommendations contained in that report. Senator Minihan discussed a research report entitled Getting Inside Men's Health. It was specifically commissioned to inform the development of men's health policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Senators Feeney and Kitt, among others, raised the issue of lifestyle. Lifestyle issues for men, particularly matters such as alcohol, drink-driving, obesity, etc., are important and will be addressed in the men's health policy. We also need to tackle the underlying causes, such as why men continually take risks with their health.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I thank the Members for their very positive and constructive contribution on the issue of men's health. It is reasonable to state that for too long this issue has been confined to the margins. As a result there is much to be done in terms of addressing the grave statistics on men's health that have been put before the House today and on the previous occasions when the issue was discussed. It is readily acknowledged that in the past men's health has not achieved the attention it should have. It is now very much on the agenda of this Government, and the publication of the men's national health policy in the summer with the men's health action plan later this year will represent significant steps in improving men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Many challenges lie ahead in the implementation of the policy, not least the challenge of embracing the diversity within men and that there are many different ways to be a man. It is imperative that men's health is defined outside a narrow biomedical model and embraces a broader social determinants view. This will require a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach for successful implementation. It is incumbent on this policy not just to promote health-affirming changes to men's attitudes and behaviours but to create a supportive environment and strengthen community action towards men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In this respect, effective men's health policy must draw on multiple strategies that target individual behaviours while considering issues at the macro and environmental level. It is important that the policy has a clear timeframe for implementation and a clearly defined means of evaluating outcomes. A great challenge in the years ahead is perhaps the need to strengthen the evidence base on men's health in Ireland and identify what works best in different contexts.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">There are major challenges for the development and implementation of the policy but I am confident there is a willingness and commitment from all involved to deal with the issue and ensure we bring about major improvements in men's health for the years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms M. Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_259">I thank the House for this invitation to address it on the subject of the Government's commitment to funding for third level education and the reform of medical education. There have been significant recent announcements on these fronts and I am glad of the opportunity to exchange views with Senators on the direction we are taking. I propose to outline these developments in some detail for Members of the House and to set them in the context of broader Government strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">As Senators are well aware, higher education in Ireland has come through a period of major expansion. It has transformed from an elite sector of less than 20,000 students in the mid-1960s to a system that now caters for over 130,000 students and a majority of school leavers each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">More than 30,000 new third level places have been created since this Government took office in 1997. Overall investment in the sector per annum has more than doubled over that period. This now stands at €1.7 billion in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The major expansion of higher education, through the development of the institutes of technology and the major growth in participation rates, has been an extremely important factor in our economic success over recent years. Indeed, the commitment of successive Governments over many years to invest in education at first, second and third levels has been widely recognised as an extremely far-sighted contribution to our modern economic and social status.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In seeking to develop future competitive strengths in the global knowledge era, similar vision and an even more determined approach to investment in our skills, creativity and innovation capacity are now required. The Government's strategic ambition for Ireland is to continue to develop as a world-leading knowledge economy. To achieve that, and to enjoy the social dividends that flow from it, we need to produce quality skilled graduates at third level and quality researchers at fourth level who can serve the high-value needs of the emerging sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The independent review of lreland's higher education system conducted by the OECD during 2004 had identified the need for change and development in the sector if it was to contribute effectively to these broad national goals. The Government has endorsed this strategic agenda for change in the sector and the need to align this with policies for investment and funding. Ireland's successful transition from being a technology-importing, low-cost economy to a technology-based, innovation economy depends critically on progress on this front.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">In my pursuit of these broader national objectives, investment in higher education has been a major policy priority. When I set out my approach to a programme of development and change in higher education in April 2005, I announced my intention to establish a strategic innovation fund to drive the transformation of the sector by promoting collaboration and change. I am delighted that budget 2006 enabled this multiannual fund to become a reality with an allocation of €300 million over the next five years. Significantly, this was announced as part of a wider additional investment package for higher education of €1.2 billion. This funding will serve to transform higher education in a number of ways. It will allow high priority infrastructural projects to be addressed, drive the reform and change agenda at an institutional level and promote collaboration and change in pursuit of system wide excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Achieving the desired change is a complex and challenging task. I intend to make the strategic innovation fund available to higher education institutions to support the following key objectives: incentivise and reward internal restructuring and rationalisation efforts; provide for improved performance management systems; meet staff training and support requirements associated with the reform of structures and the implementation of new processes; implement improved management information systems; introduce teaching and learning reforms, including enhanced teaching methods, programme restructuring, modularisation and e-learning; support quality improvement initiatives aimed at excellence; and promote access, transfer and progression and incentivise stronger interinstitutional collaboration in the development and delivery of programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">A major emphasis of the fund is the promotion of inter-institutional collaboration in building world class strength within the Irish system. The quality of higher education in Ireland must be measured against the highest standards across the world. The emphasis being placed on promoting collaboration through this fund is deliberate. Collectively, our higher education institutions represent a very valuable national resource. The full potential of that resource can only be achieved through a systemwide approach that builds on our strengths.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Awards under the fund will be made on the basis of a competitive call for proposals. The Higher Education Authority has been asked to develop the detailed criteria for the fund with a view to making an early call for proposals. An international panel of experts will be convened to consider the proposals submitted and to make objective recommendations on funding awards. An initial €15 million will be available this year for what is essentially a start-up period. This will grow to €60 million in 2007 and to €75 million per annum in each of 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">In framing proposals, there will be a requirement on institutions to contribute funds from their own resources to copper fasten the reform efforts. This is important in ensuring that the fund can leverage fundamental change by promoting new thinking and new priorities in the use of existing resources. The overall objective is to achieve new levels of performance at third level and, building on this, to develop a fourth-level system of research that can be benchmarked against the highest international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">In pursuing these objectives, continuing investment in the basic physical facilities on third level campuses around the country is an essential foundation. As part of the budget day announcements, €900 million capital funding was allocated for higher education projects as part of my five year envelope for 2006 to 2010. This will allow me to deal with a number of key projects in universities and institutes of technology identified as part of the needs assessment and prioritisation exercise conducted by the Kelly review group for the Higher Education Authority. I have already announced a series of major projects across the country which will now be progressed either by conventional procurement or under the public private partnership initiative. A total of 53 major capital projects across the system have been earmarked for progression. A remaining balance of some €200 million will be used to deal with emerging priorities in the context of overall national strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The budget announcement of a new multiannual funding package for higher education came on foot of an important 7% increase in core funding for the sector in 2006 and a 17% increase in research and development funding for this year. This Government's record of investment in research and development in higher education has been one of its outstanding achievements. The research landscape has been transformed over recent years with the establishment of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and Science Foundation Ireland. Awards totalling more than €605 million have been made under the PRTLI for the development of basic research infrastructure across our higher education institutions. Prior to 1999, there was no dedicated programme of basic research funding in the Irish system.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">It is the Government intention to continue building on this and an ambitious new national research plan is to be considered by a Cabinet committee shortly. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have both indicated that investment in our intellectual capital through higher education will be a central objective of the successor national development plan now being prepared. I look forward to returning to these issues in this House as we continue to pursue these fundamentally important objectives for Ireland's future economic and social prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I want to turn to the more specific issue of reform in medical education and training, which, as members are aware, was the subject of two landmark reports jointly published by the Tánaiste and I last week, namely, the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training, chaired by Professor Pat Fottrell and the Report of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training group, chaired by Dr. Jane Buttimer. The two reports represent the most significant review of medical education and training ever undertaken in Ireland. They make a series of major recommendations across the continuum of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education and training, spanning the education and health systems in a variety of delivery settings. These are aimed at responding to the needs of a changing health system and ensuring that medical education in Ireland is sufficiently resourced and developed to maintain our reputation for producing quality doctors in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">In joining the Tánaiste to launch the reports, I was particularly pleased that the Government is already in a position to respond to the reports' complex range of recommendations. The Government has approved a €200 million multiannual programme of investment in medical education that will more than double the number of places, provide an additional access route for entry to medical education, facilitate significant curriculum reform and provide for improvements in the provision of clinical training.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Specifically, it is now intended to increase the annual number of undergraduate places for Irish and EU students from 305 to 485 and to introduce a separate graduate entry stream to medical education which will provide 240 additional places per annum. These increases will be phased in over a four-year period, commencing this autumn when an additional 70 undergraduate places will be provided. A further 40 places will be provided in 2007 and 35 in each of 2008 and 2009. The Higher Education Authority will begin immediate consultations with existing medical schools on the provision of the additional undergraduate places.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The authority will also issue a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to the additional places being provided on this programme from 2007. The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry based on their leaving certificate performance. The high points pressures associated with this has had a negative knock-on impact on the senior cycle school experience for many students. Graduate entry, which will be open to graduates of all disciplines, will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession. The Higher Education Authority will now establish an expert group to develop a standardised test that, drawing on best international practice, will evaluate aptitude and suitability for entry to the graduate programme. This selection test will be in place for 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">In the interests of alleviating the enormous pressures of high CAO points requirements, the Fottrell report recommended that leaving certificate results should no longer be the sole selection criterion for undergraduate entry. It proposes that all students with 450 leaving certificate points be considered for selection on the basis of a separate aptitude test. I am a keen supporter of the fairness and objectivity of the points system but I recognise that the pressures on students wishing to study medicine in terms of achieving an almost perfect leaving certificate are excessive and unnecessary. For that reason, I am anxious to explore the detailed options with regard to a dual selection process. There is a need, however, to ensure that the revised system will adequately reward strong academic performance, provide an appropriate evaluation of aptitude and suitability for a career in medicine and will retain public confidence in its objectivity and fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I have asked the HEA expert group to bring forward more detailed proposals on the proposed new undergraduate selection system, to devise an appropriate second selection test for use at undergraduate level and to advise on the logistics of its administration. The expert group is to report to me by summer 2006 in order to allow a clear signal of any proposed changes to be given to the cohort of students entering the senior cycle, that is, those going into fifth year in September 2006. To allow adequate notice to students, the new entry procedures for undergraduate medical education will not be introduced any sooner than September 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Fottrell report lays strong emphasis on the need for curriculum reform, with a greater emphasis on small group interaction, problem-based learning approaches and interdisciplinary contact. It is also critical that clinical placements for students provide a highly-effective learning experience. These are essential elements of the reforms and investment on which we are now embarking. I have allocated an additional €4 million in 2006 to commence investment in curriculum improvements, clinical training and the provision of 70 additional places this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Unprecedented investment is now being made in our higher education system in pursuit of the development of the knowledge base on which Ireland's growth strategy, and the economic and social benefits that will flow from that, depends. Supporting our higher education institutions is a major policy priority. The targeted investments that this Government is now making in the higher education infrastructure, in promoting excellence through system wide collaboration and change, in widening access and in creating a vibrant fourth level sector are key long-term investments in Ireland's future. I know that Seanad Éireann endorses the objectives we are pursuing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_281">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to the House. Her speech is a very positive indication of her commitment to change. In her address, she emphasised the importance of change, development and investment and has demonstrated that these three principles are foremost in her mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">It is important that as a relatively new Minister, Deputy Hanafin has undertaken much-needed reform of the third level sector. I do not wish to be political at this point, but in the past year the presidents of all of our colleges and third level institutions found themselves facing a financial crisis as a result of the fact that investment, under successive Ministers, had not kept pace with investment in other sectors, or even within the education system itself. The third level sector had fallen behind. It has been recognised that if our third level institutions cannot produce graduates of the highest quality because of underinvestment, this will have negative implications for the creation of new job opportunities in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The Fottrell report is welcome and timely because it is clear to everyone that there is a shortage of medical practitioners in this country. In rural Ireland in particular, gaining access to a doctor, even during so-called working hours, is difficult and outside those hours, virtually impossible. The consequence of that is the crisis that exists in accident and emergency departments in many hospitals. The Minister, by creating an environment which will allow for the training of additional doctors, has allowed us to hope for a change in that situation. While it may be too late for some, for many people who rely on their general practitioner, this is a welcome step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Some third level institutions have been preparing for this announcement for a number of years and may have the capacity to take in additional students this year. I am referring, in particular, to the University of Limerick, which has additional capacity through its forward-looking development plan. I ask the Minister to consider that option if it is available to her. It would move the reform programme forward and allow for a faster throughput of doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Entry to the GMS scheme is problematic and has been for some time. I hope that any review being undertaken of training and output of medical practitioners will also examine access to the GMS scheme. Such access is a serious problem in rural areas and particularly in the west, where a high proportion of the population is ageing and where the need for access to the scheme will be even greater in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the package announced by the Minister in co-operation with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. If there is an opportunity to accelerate change and move the programme forward, I hope it will not be lost. There is no doubt that we have trained medical practitioners of the highest quality, who can take their rightful place at the top of any medical system. Indeed, many are in the highest positions abroad. Unfortunately, as the Fottrell report makes clear, many of our medical graduates are forced to go abroad for additional specialist training. The Minister did not refer specifically to this issue today but I hope there will be a parallel development of specialist training in Ireland. While such training is available here, its further development must be accelerated, in tandem with the proposed increased output of general medical practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Most people accept that the requirements for entry into medical faculties that existed until now, through the CAO system, made it almost impossible for students to gain entry without seriously damaging their lifestyles. In many cases, the pressure to gain the enormous number of points required took its toll on gifted students, whose only ambition was to gain access to medical school. I am pleased that the barrier is to be reduced somewhat, but not to the extent that the quality of those who gain access will deteriorate markedly. The fact that the pressure on students will be reduced is very welcome. The proposal for aptitude tests and interviews must be given careful consideration and I welcome the fact that a working group has been established to finalise the terms of the tests. Currently, people joining the Civil Service at any level must do an aptitude test and its content is relevant to the job application. I do not know, however, how an aptitude test could be framed to identify what is required to make a good doctor. I heard an eminent medical practitioner on the radio after the Minister announced her proposals asking how a test could assess the characteristics required. The experts the Minister has drawn together have an unenviable task and I hope they can devise a method whereby that end will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I am concerned about an aptitude test being seen as a step forward. There were also hints that we might go along the English route, where the test would be followed by an interview.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_289">Absolutely not.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_290">If that was the case, and I am glad the Minister has said it is not, we are too small a country to do it. In the past, once there was a family tradition established in the medical profession, it would carry on. Thankfully that has been eliminated by the present system.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">If there is a commitment to invest resources in this plan it will succeed and we will get the number and calibre of people we need in the medical profession. It will require investment, particularly if we wish to increase our current intake of Irish and EU students. There will necessarily be a subsequent decrease in the number of non-European students from Asia, Africa and America. We have taken those students from outside Europe for financial reasons, to balance the Exchequer input; that was part of the problem that led to the present crisis. Many of those trained in our medical schools went back to their own countries, leaving a need here. Now there is an opportunity to address that and strike a balance in favour of Irish students. They may have to go abroad for further specialist training but the Minister might rectify that in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Irish intake is currently made up of students who have just completed their leaving certificate but now there will be a graduate intake, with a ratio of 60:40 in favour of second level entrants. The graduate students who enter training will come in with experience of life in another profession and will add a level of experience greater than that of ordinary entrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I welcome the proposals in the report. I would like the Minister to fast-track the process and see if an intake at the University of Limerick is possible. That would greatly improve the situation. Many more students at second level will now be able to aspire to entry to medical school.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I welcome the Minister to the House. Her approach to the funding of third level education was set out in detail in her speech. It is important to remind the House of the Minister's stated objective on third level education and her intention to invest in the enhancement of third level to support national strategic goals. That theme has recurred every time the Minister has discussed her vision of and priorities for third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The OECD report published in 2004 stated that if we want to lead in the information age, we must have a world class third level education system. It is clear that it has been the Minister's intention from the outset to build on the Government's success in achieving that goal. The Minister has outlined the packages that have been provided prior to and since the budget in terms of capital and current spending and the innovation fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There are two partners in this scenario — the Government and those who deliver the services. Sometimes it is forgotten when criticising the Government's commitment to putting third level education at the centre of our national strategy that the other partner to the deal was not front-loading either. The Minister's predecessors challenged the bona fides of those agencies, both the universities and the institutes, to be more specific about delivery of objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">A submission was made to Government last year on reform of the culture in the institutes and relationships between them. In this regard it is significant to note that the Minister's achievement in securing increased funding for third level education in the budget has silenced some of the Government's loudest critics. I was also heartened to read in recent weeks that some of her most vocal critics have become some of her most vocal champions. This is a matter of public record. For example, one former critic stated the Minister has achieved a seismic shift in Government policy on third level funding, which has become anchored at the heart of our national economic and social strategy. This is a heartening development. While I do not propose to address issues in detail at this point, I will do so in my concluding remarks if the opportunity arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I warmly welcome the contemporaneous publication of the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training, known as the Fottrell report, and the joint announcement by the Minister and her colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, of a €200 million package of reforms of medical education, a major initiative which will be of critical importance. I read recently — I am not good at tracing my sources — that the problems facing the health service can be simplified by breaking them into two parts, namely, funding and service delivery. This applies equally to first, second and third level education. The scribe in question pointed out that while health service funding was characterised by serious shortcomings in the past, these have been compensated for in large measure in recent years and it is now up to the other parties, the professionals in the field, to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The working group on undergraduate medical education, which was established in 2003, has now reported to the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. The publication of the Fottrell report is timely. Its conclusions and recommendations represent a broad consensus of views and analysis from top professionals and administrators drawn from the full range of stakeholders involved in the delivery of medical education and training and the health service in general. This is important as it ensures the Ministers are given an holistic, rounded picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I join the Minister in paying tribute to Professor Patrick Fottrell and his working group. Like her, I believe the report before us is a landmark document which charts our future course in medical education. I also acknowledge the publication of a report on postgraduate specialist training by Dr. Jane Buttimer. Before commenting on several of the many issues addressed in the Fottrell report, including weaknesses in the system and how, based on international best practice and excellence, we should meet the challenges which constantly arise in the health service, I pay tribute to the standards of excellence achieved by our doctors and consultants at national and international level. While I have been an occasional critic of certain aspects of the medical professions' behaviour and have not changed my views in this regard, nevertheless, I commend their excellence over the decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">When the working group on undergraduate medical education under Professor Fottrell started work on its terms of reference it noted major lacunae in terms of how we will meet future needs and recommended radical changes across the spectrum, particularly in the area of medical education and training, for which it envisaged a critical role in enhancing the quality of health care delivery. In responding to the report, the Minister's initiative facilitates greater access to the medical profession, a point on which all sides agree. It also has the potential to address at least two issues of major significance, namely, the easing of entry to medical training and the provision of greater numbers of doctors to service our medical care needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">As we are all aware, entry to the medical profession has become extraordinarily competitive in recent years. The leaving certificate requirement for entry to medical training is, I understand, 570 points and the CAO system is the virtually the only entry route to the system. I understand a small number enter the professions via the medical schools but I am not familiar with the procedure or numbers involved. While the CAO system is a fair assessment and yardstick of competitive academic achievement, it has serious shortcomings in its application to training for medical professionals. I am pleased, therefore, that the working group examined this issue and made some far-reaching proposals for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">As with most professions, aptitude and suitability are key requirements for qualification as a medical professional. We have all known academically brilliant people who achieved fantastic leaving certificate results and flew through medical school with many accolades but proved unfit for the job. If unfitness for a job is damaging and potentially dangerous in any profession, it is in medicine where lives and the health of individuals are at risk. The approach to aptitude and suitability recommended in the report is critically important. The reforms proposed by the Minister for Education and Science and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children include the introduction of a new graduate entry programme for medicine, the development of new aptitude tests for selection for graduate entry and a new selection mechanism to involve a combination of CAO points and suitability test performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Minister consistently emphasises that all new criteria must be objective, transparent and fair and must be seen to be so. The competitive selection measures must adhere to these fundamental principles. The reforms will have considerable benefits in opening up access routes to those who aspire to a medical vocation but could not realise their aspiration as a result of failing to obtain the required points in the leaving certificate examination. As a result of the variety of routes to be introduced under the proposed reform programme, many adults who still cling to their childhood dream of working in medicine — we all know some of them — will have an opportunity to realise their dreams because they will be given a second chance. It is wonderful to introduce a second chance for all professions based on fundamental criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I am pleased the Minister has selected a basic points threshold of 450. This is a wise, fair and reasonable decision as the figure reflects an appropriate level of ability for those who aspire to practise medicine, a discipline which requires them to constantly increase their scientific and technical knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As regards the aptitude test, I will address some of the issues raised by Senator Ulick Burke. I am an advocate of the aptitude test. The Minister is determined about fairness, objectivity and transparency. Who will devise the aptitude tests? What is the appropriate aptitude test for a person going into medicine? What constitutes, as near as we can achieve, the ideal test for such a person? The same question applies to teaching and other professions but medicine is more critical. What input will doctors have into designing the test? What score will be given to familiarity with the medical profession? Will it be seen to favour a candidate who socialises in a medical household? It must not.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Minister will be anxious to ensure the new system does not facilitate a privileged entry corridor for the sons and daughters of doctors. It is vital that from the outset the integrity of the system be seen to exist and be safeguarded. I suggest the oversight committee, to which the Minister referred, be employed to monitor the formulation, introduction and implementation of the aptitude test system. This may be inappropriate but it is a suggestion. If it is not appropriate, another body should be considered for the role.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I welcome the doubling of places for Irish and EU students. Like Senator Ulick Burke, most of us were never happy with the fact that previously up to 60% of the student intake has been of non-EU students. It is inappropriate for a progressive country such as ours. It is unacceptable that we should then have to recruit doctors from abroad, often from countries where they are needed, instead of training more of our own. The Minister has grasped that nettle and is implementing reforms on a phased basis. We must be realistic about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We would all love to aspire to Senator Ulick Burke's suggestions but this can be done only on a phased basis. There are significant implications for costs, curriculum change, group sizes and interaction between professionals. Developments are also required which medical students will need to see in place, which they have never had before and which the Fottrell report found to be serious lacunae without which we could not aspire to compete with international best practice. I accept that the Minister for Education and Science, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Government can approach this only on a phased basis but it is heartening that they are starting now and I welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I welcome the path on which the Minister has started. Although there are commendable elements to it, there is no such thing as a perfect system and there will always be slight questions. I have one or two, one on the repeat leaving certificate. Although we are all idealists, pragmatism must play a role. If I had more time I would explore it further but I will not dwell on that now.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">This programme of reforms of medical education and training is not a quick fix. Such a solution does not exist. It is a vital element of the programme of reform of the health services and of medical education and training. It is critical we do it now. The programme outlined by the Minister has unquestionable merit as a solution. It is not a fond hope but a well-founded, prudent plan to address the inadequacies of our deficient medical service and I commend it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_312">I welcome the Minister to the House. Despite being one of the university Senators I hope she will forgive me if I do not concentrate on the funding for third level education. I appreciate it greatly and welcome everything the Minister said in her speech. As I have been involved for many years in medical education I will concentrate on the Fottrell report.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Although it has been said that the report is timely, it is long overdue. For years we have known we were in a dire situation regarding the production of our own graduates. For almost 30 years there has been a cap of 305 and we have known it was far too small, even for replacement numbers. We had a policy of taking people from the third world to perform much of the service commitment in our hospitals. That was wrong and I am delighted to see that this report has come forward now.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I am cheered by the Minister's response to the report. I am sure her decision before the report was published to provide an extra 70 places for EU students this year was due to the motion I placed before the Seanad last year encouraging this to happen and which was supported by the Independent Senators. It is nice to see one's advice taken occasionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I will quote from the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_316">In this new model of medical education there will be more students, more diverse delivery settings, more small-group work and interaction, including mentoring procedures and more inter-disciplinary contact. This therefore involves considerable logistical support on a scale not seen to date. The gain will be graduates more fitted to the complex, increasingly multi-cultural society Ireland has become.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Judging by the Minister's speech today and by what she has said outside this House her approach to the report has been wise. The recommendations cannot be brought in on what may be termed a "big bang" basis with everything implemented at once. I have examined the various scenarios as to how undergraduates and graduates would be phased in to the system over a certain number of years from years one to 11 and how the non-EU graduates, who, it has been said by everyone, have been supporting the system financially, will be phased out. It is extraordinarily optimistic and the Minister's approach is wise.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">As the situation regarding admission requirements has concentrated most people and will concentrate the public, I will deal with it first. The Minister is wise to focus on undergraduate students. Everybody agrees that doing interviews in such a small country is not a good idea. The Minister should be careful with aptitude tests. Other university subjects have high demand and high points. Why are veterinary medicine, pharmacy and physiotherapy not also singled out? A wide range of people are needed in medicine. A pathologist is not the same kind of person as a general practitioner. No survey has yet concluded that very intelligent people are less compassionate or less able to communicate than people with lesser intellectual abilities. I was delighted to see the chairman of the Irish College of General Practitioners, a discipline in which communication and compassion are most needed, saying that.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The Minister should be careful with aptitude tests, particularly given that the US Commission on Civil Rights has complained about them in 2002 saying they are biased against socially disadvantaged people, ethnic groups and even women. Some 300 universities have abandoned them or said they must be taken in conjunction with a school-based assessment. This is from the 2003 report on the website of the National Centre for Education Statistics. Professor Kathleen Lynch, professor of equality studies in UCD and senior lecturer in education, has frequently pointed this out. In the United Kingdom the biomedical admissions test, BMAT, is said to considerably favour those who are taking higher mathematics and physics as subjects. There was a House of Commons debate on this recently and we must be careful we do not get involved in a pseudo-science that favours the best-off who can afford grinds in aptitude tests, as happened in America. This is the reason they have made such a mountain of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">We urgently need to address curriculum changes. The pre-clinical changes have taken place, to a certain extent, because people are entering with higher qualifications in sciences in general than was true when I entered medicine 40 years ago, which means the problems are not great. Some of the medical schools have reduced their courses from six years to five. Five years is recommended for those who enter as undergraduates in this situation. However, before we can introduce all the Fottrell recommendations, we need to bring all colleges around to this idea, as it cannot be implemented on a piecemeal basis. A great deal of consultation will be required even at the pre-clinical stage to ascertain how colleges can shorten some of their courses, in which people have greater expertise than they had in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I qualified 40 years ago last year and the clinical training and how it is delivered have not changed much over the years. What is suggested in the report will be incredibly expensive. The expense will arise in numerous areas. It is not widely recognised that most clinical training is done by people who are not paid to do it. Only 40 academic whole-time equivalents are being paid to give clinical medical training. When students complain about frequent no-shows of those who are to give clinical training — the report states this can be as high as 30% — it is important to remember that those people are not being paid to do it. It has an enormous impact on service work. That will take considerable retraining and re-skilling of those who are involved in the clinical training.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">One group has not been mentioned. There will be considerable change for patients. Patients could be described as the raw material for teaching these students in clinical training. I was rather disappointed that the report laid no emphasis on them. It has been suggested that patients be seen in different settings. Most students see patients either in acute hospitals or within primary care practices. It would be good if they could see patients in their own homes or in community care settings. However, the logistics would be significant. A very significant level of support staff would be required in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Students are frequently taught in clinical sites that were never designed for teaching. I never allowed more than three students into a cubicle with me. However, the students must wait outside in order that the patient's consent can be sought to allow them be present for the consultation and examination. It is necessary to seek consent for students to be present even if the patient is to be anaesthetised. All this takes some time. I have had cases where, for example, a patient has agreed to give consent provided their daughter can be present. The daughter had a child in a buggy. The cubicle contained me, the nurse, the patient, the daughter, the child and the buggy. When the three students came in the cubicle became very congested, which would be made worse if we were forced to increase the number of students to four, five or six.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">A doctor must try to treat a patient and teach at the same time. I always enjoyed teaching, so that was not a problem. Most places have few or no tutorial rooms and small lecture theatres, which are the types of issues mentioned in the report. It will cost a considerable amount to put these facilities in place before we can, with any dignity for patients, introduce much of what is suggested in the report. I regret that such reference to patients was left out of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I like the phased approach of the Minister for Education and Science and while her partner is the Minister for Health and Children, both of them will have trouble with their superior, the Minister for Finance, who will need to give far more than the €4 million he has given this year. That will be very little given that a sum of €100 million is mentioned in the report. Enormous sums of money will be needed for all the small units in the hospitals in this city where doctors will be trying to teach increased numbers of students while still giving the patients the dignity and privacy all of us would want them to have. This area needs to be addressed with the greatest of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Non-EU students provide approximately 60% of the funds to run the medical schools, which is enormous. Owing to the approach the Minister for Education and Science is taking, she will need to ensure that the Minister for Finance understands that he cannot turn off the tap in four years' time and suggest increasing the numbers of non-EU students to increase the money coming in. We cannot have a turn-on and turn off- approach. It has taken 20 years to get many of those students to take up places here, given the tremendous competition from universities in the United Kingdom. This type of scheme is so popular that Italy now has medical courses in English. We need to commit to a long-term approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">It is a very good idea to bring in more graduates, as is done by most medical schools by giving places to approximately 20 such students each year. While they do well, it is much more difficult for those who graduated from arts disciplines than for those with science backgrounds. They have frequently told me they never realised they would need to work so hard. In general they are extremely committed, work very hard and do very well. However, now many of them will also have a significant financial commitment and they will start their medical careers either with huge loans, which they will need to repay or with obligations relating to grants given to them. This is what happens in America resulting in increased medical charges, as the doctors must repay their huge loans. Most medical graduates in America now finish with a loan of approximately $120,000, or €100,000, which is very big.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">While we are enthusiastic about getting more graduates — one of my colleagues said they are much less trouble as it is not necessary to spend half as much time minding them, etc. — we must remember that they will also have their own problems, for example, having families to deal with. As pointed out in Dr. Buttimer's report, flexi-training becomes far more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Hospitals will need more facilities to allow for clinical training with clinicians and will also need more facilities for students, which will cost more money. I would suggest that sufficient account has not been taken of this matter either. It is disappointing that we have been considered to be falling behind in development both nationally and internationally, which is one of the most important matters for the Minister to tackle. She should try to encourage those involved in teaching to raise whatever standards are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I come to the issue of the intern year. Much medical care is still provided by non-consultant hospital doctors. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children is working towards consultant-provided health care but we still have many non-consultant doctors whose numbers we are trying to cut down. In view of the increase in the number of medical students we will have to increase the number of intern posts by approximately 300, but what are interns looking for? They seek junior house officer posts and, subsequently, they will seek senior house officer posts. We know from the Buttimer report the number of them who go abroad for training but, unfortunately — I can speak from family experience — unless consultants' posts in those disciplines in which the person is training abroad are available here when they finish training, they will take up places in the United Kingdom, America, Australia and elsewhere and are then lost to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">In addition to the situation regarding the intern posts, which will cost the Minister for Finance a fortune, we also must address the question of improved training programmes in this country. We should get rid of the non-consultant hospital doctor posts for which there is little training and concentrate on those with good training because we have to improve the position as outlined in the Buttimer report whereby many people go abroad. After all the Minister's fine efforts in helping them get through medical school, they end up running the large hospitals in New York, Washington, London, Newcastle and elsewhere and do not come back here to treat the Irish public as many Senators want.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I congratulate the Minister on her approach and implore her not to be pushed into taking measures too rapidly. We had to wait a very long time for this report, and I compliment the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, on commissioning it. Now is the time to consider it carefully; there is no need for a big bang approach. What the Minister is doing to date is extremely good.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_333">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for her statement. The last time I spoke on this topic, the context was the position of the Irish education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and level of participation. The motion before the House on that occasion expressed the view of the House that we were anxious to maintain quality, responsiveness and competitiveness as a priority in higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Today's contributions follow directly on from this in terms of ensuring that the quality and level of participation in education is maintained through funding and other measures and how we can make responsiveness and competitiveness features of our education system. In my contribution I want to focus on two particular developments of importance to third level funding, namely, the most recent budget and the publication of the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training, chaired by Professor Fottrell.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The budget gave a useful indication of the Government's view of the country's priorities as being infrastructure development, welfare, pensions, child care, fair taxation and helping the consumer. It is noticeable, first, that investment in third level education is also a specific priority and, second, that it features under the heading of supporting our economic success. In the 1980s the challenge was to turn economic stagnation and social despair into a situation where we could prioritise the areas where massive investment was to be targeted. We must be able to create an environment in which the economy thrives, jobs are created, revenue is generated, better public services are provided and the vulnerable are assisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The Government has pursued economic policies with social objectives that have made that investment possible, and we are not inclined to stop now. Ireland's education system was the basis for the rapid economic progress we have made in recent decades. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance stated that a disproportionate amount of emphasis is placed on taxation policy as a key element in our economic success. While this has been extremely important, I agree that the single biggest contributor to our success has been the availability to both indigenous and foreign investors of an exceptionally well-educated workforce. In this regard, prudent financial management, which is a core policy of the Progressive Democrats, demands that we continue to position ourselves at the very front of the world's knowledge-based economies. Prudent financial management means not just managing the present but also preparing for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">When I spoke on this issue in the previous debate in the House, I said it is imperative that we ensure our education system is kept relevant to our wider social and economic needs. In a changing society and a rapidly evolving economy, higher education must be continually challenged to remain relevant and responsive. Education skills, research and innovation are the by-words for success in the new economic era. That means that there must be a strong and constant connection between higher education policy and our national development needs. A natural economy was once based upon natural resources — coal, gas, oil, agriculture and so on — but if knowledge is the new basis of a national economy, then the rules have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The budget is a key part of making that happen. It acknowledges the connection I referred to and the changing of the rules. It also acknowledges the need for substantial change and improvement in quality in our universities and centres of higher learning. It is an acceptance that we must pursue the so-called system wide collaboration, maximising potential by applying the collective strengths of our third level institutions. The budget allows for a multi-annual strategic innovation fund for higher education and the establishment of a new PhD level of education at fourth level.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I commend the Minister for the allocation of €300 million to the strategic innovation fund for higher education over the next five years. It is entirely appropriate that we provide for competition for these new funds to stimulate excellence through collaboration and change. The Government is also committing €900 million to the third level sector over the next five years as part of the Department of Education and Science capital envelope. Some €630 million of that investment will be from Exchequer funds; the balance will come via public-private partnership initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Before I move on to discuss the working report group, I wish to stress one point. I said at the outset that the Progressive Democrats have pursued economic policies not for its own sake but as a vehicle to deliver the best services for society. Over the next four years, planned capital investment and the strategic innovation fund for third level will total €1.2 billion, an incredible sum of money. That investment will be targeted. The people of Ireland have worked hard to make this type of funding possible. We employ the right policies to maximise the benefits of that work and the budget provisions for third level education are testament to the rectitude of our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The second element of my contribution concerns the Fottrell report and it is closely linked to the issues I explored earlier in that education and research are critical to the quality of service delivered in our health system by those persons educated in Ireland to train and work in Ireland. In my previous contribution on this topic, I expressed my concern about the entrance requirements and access, especially in the health sciences areas. The Higher Education Authority report of 2003 proposed reform of graduate entry to medicine and a range of other health professional disciplines. The goal was to relieve some of the pressure associated with entry to these programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">In framing the programme for Government, the Progressive Democrats and our partners in Government committed to addressing that specific issue. This was in recognition of the point I raised earlier regarding the negative impact such high-pressure competition has on the second level education system. In this regard I commend the Minister for Education and Science and the Tánaiste for jointly establishing the working group on undergraduate medical education and training. More significantly, I acknowledge and commend the work of the group that recommended the number of EU places in undergraduate education, a course curriculum in the medical schools, graduate entry programmes, accreditation and increases in the number of academic clinicians as well as the many other complex issues that shape the delivery of undergraduate medical education.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">On foot of this great work, the Minister together with the Tánaiste jointly announced a €200 million initiative for major reform of medical education and training, which correctly encompasses the system from undergraduate level through to postgraduate training. In general terms, the doubling of numbers for Irish and EU students has received most comment. This is due, most likely, to the pressures of entry I mentioned earlier and is not surprising.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">However, there is a wider significance to the reforms announced by the Minister. We must guarantee a significant number of highly-trained doctors for our growing population, but this will also allow for a wider programme of health reform. It will mean a shift from a consultant-led to a consultant-provided service, increased emphasis on doctors, nurses and other health professionals working in multidisciplinary teams. It will also lead to a more co-ordinated approach to medical education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The two reports produced by the groups chaired by Dr. Jane Buttimer and Professor Fottrell inform important steps towards the development and reform of medical education. A great debt is owed to these groups. They will facilitate an integrated implementation strategy, as the Tánaiste has stated, to enhance and modernise medical education and training across the continuum from the undergraduate stage through to specialised training.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I said at the outset that we must be in a position to provide targeted investment in third level education. We must also have the correct strategy to ensure that investment delivers the excellence associated with the Irish education system. While this becomes increasingly complex as we move from a more conventional to a knowledge-based economy, the measures outlined in the budget and the developments on foot of the Fottrell report demonstrate that the Government is committed to maintaining that standard of excellence. I compliment the Minister on the leadership and initiatives she has taken in this regard, which will not only benefit Irish citizens, but also the economy.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_349">I intend to speak on some general points as regards funding which I have raised before with the Minister. She has attended many debates in this House, in contrast to her predecessor as Minister for Education and Science. I looked at the monitor one evening and noticed she was attending Adjournment matters in the House. She is one of the few Ministers to have attended the House on such matters, which indicates the degree of interest she has in education. I welcome her here again.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Funding for universities and colleges of technology should encourage these institutions to offer courses in a more flexible way. A related point is that the difference between full-time and part-time participation should be blurred. I have made that point before and it is important that the Minister starts to direct third level education in the direction of the model, as I have outlined it, as this will help in efforts to increase access to third level education from different sectors of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Access to third level should not merely be determined by the leaving certificate and the points system, rather there should be a system based essentially on the lifelong learning model. This would encourage people to get third level qualifications according to their needs. It would allow a person to go, for example, from certificate level to a diploma, to a PhD, if necessary, as sometimes happens. They should be able to go from part-time to full-time education and back, from the institute of technology sector to university and back again. Our education system needs to be modelled more along these lines if it is to meet the requirements of modern society Some people cannot afford to enter full-time education on finishing school or they may not have the expectations of third level at that point. They may need a second or third chance to return to education to get a third level qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">This type of approach is also very important for the economy because it ensures that people upskill, particularly those working in vulnerable manufacturing areas, for example, whose job opportunities might be lessened by industrial developments. There is also a need to get more mature people involved in the education system, which is very much the concept for Irish education advocated in various reports including that of the OECD.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Incentives are needed to encourage the take-up of engineering and computerised technology places. The Government and the colleges have ignored and tended to cover up the lack of demand last September as regards the significant number of vacant places for engineering courses across the board. Many universities were advertising class vacancies, for the first time, when the CAO places were being offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">A related issue is the need to implement the recommendations of the task force on lifelong learning. There have also been calls by Aontas and the Labour Party that the free fees initiative should be extended to part-time students. This has been costed by Aontas, which puts the required figure at approximately €40 a year. It could be more, but some of the costs could be absorbed by introducing a more flexible model where there is less of a distinction between part-time and full-time education and colleges are funded on a credit basis. This would take into account a larger student body, reflecting changes in the country's demographic profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Government must support colleges towards engaging with the existing workforce and it must urgently address the skills deficit of that workforce. It must also address the recommendations of the NESF report, published last Monday. I represent the Clondalkin area which still has unemployment blackspots relative to other parts of the country. Institutes of technology should be entitled to funding to carry out special training projects for school-leavers and the unemployed in such areas. Take, for example, the IC manufacturing plant in Grange Castle. People in Clondalkin need to be upskilled so that they can apply for jobs there as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I welcome the announcement that the number of student places in undergraduate medical education is to be increased. The route into medicine by way of a primary degree and non-medical subjects is a good idea. At the same time significant recognition must be given to science and technology courses. The new entry mechanism can provide a greater opportunity to make the doctor profile more representative of the population in general. More doctors are needed from places such as Clondalkin, Tallaght and so on. The key to this is to provide transfers into these postgraduate courses from institutes of technology. Various reports, including the Clancy report on access to higher education, have found that lower socio-economic groups are much more widely represented in the institutes of technology than the universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Minister said she would invite proposals on the graduate entry scheme from colleges. It is vital that the guidelines and criteria for such proposals should not discriminate against students in institutes of technology. The fact that graduates in all disciplines will be eligible for the graduate entry scheme will automatically favour universities over institutes of technologies, which tend to have a narrower spread of courses concentrated mainly in science, engineering and business. If we want different types of groups in our society to have access to medicine courses, we need to take that into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the Minister's encouragement for collaboration among colleges to allow institutes of technology to be linked with individual medical schools and colleges. For example, the Institute of Technology Tallaght could be linked with Trinity College Dublin in view of TCD's connection with Tallaght Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I share the concerns that Senators Fitzgerald and Henry expressed about the aptitude tests. Without going into the issues that have already been raised, we need to consider whether a system that is calculated on the number of leaving certificate points is not more transparent than one based on a leaving certificate together with an aptitude test. If an aptitude test is to be introduced for medicine courses just because they require students to have high points, why should such tests not be introduced for other courses that require high points or even medium or low points? For example, why should aptitude tests not apply to candidates for engineering or science courses? The introduction of aptitude tests alongside points would simply complicate the system. Why will aptitude tests apply only to one career when so many courses require high points?</p>
          <p eId="para_360">At some point down the line we should instead consider broadening the number of postgraduate places, as happens in many others professions for which access to courses is restricted only by the standards set. As the Law Society is not allowed to restrict places on law courses, many people study law but the market determines whether they get jobs as solicitors. We should allow for the fact that some people will study medicine and then enter other careers. As long as that did not constitute a huge trend, that would probably be a good thing. Just as people who study law may then go into business instead, people who study medicine might go into research or management or something else altogether. That happens in other subjects and it is not necessarily a bad thing. Many other countries produce too many doctors, but it is better to produce too many than too few. Obviously, checks and balances would still be required, but our approach should be to open up the system. If we were to do that, we would get rid of the pressure on the points system and make medicine a much more accessible career to many people from different sectors of society who have an aptitude for it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_361">As my colleague, Senator Tuffy, obviously has a lot more to say on this subject than me, I am now embarrassed that I am the cause of her having to finish her speech somewhat earlier. I apologise to her, but I had not known she would finish on such an interesting issue. However, I want to highlight a few issues, which I will do in almost bullet point fashion due to the limited time.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Without a doubt third level education is expensive and will become more so — medical education is perhaps at the pinnacle of that expense — but the real question for the Minister is who will pay for that and, in particular, who will pay for postgraduate education. Will we see the gradual return of fees, given the developments that are taking place, to which I will revert in a moment? I advise the Minister to be very wary of the universities' propaganda. I say that without equivocation, as an advocate of the other side of the dual system in third level education. The universities' conversion to issues such as relevance was forced on them by the success of the institutes of technology. The universities did not believe they were entangled in that world until the ITs began to generate a whole new vision of what constitutes third level education. Now that the universities have got their act together, I advise the Minister not to be seduced by their flowery language.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">In engineering education — which I will talk about a bit, as it is important for the country's future — there is now a tendency, which began in the United Kingdom, for the masters degree to be considered the acceptable level of qualification. I have the good fortune to be a member of the profession of chemical engineering, which is accredited by both the Institute of Engineers of Ireland and the IChemE. Two third level institutions in Ireland — UCD and Cork Institute of Technology — have received accreditation that recognises their BEng qualification as equivalent to an MEng in Britain, but the two other universities that teach chemical engineering have not received that accreditation. The issue is complex and difficult, but my personal belief is that a strong case exists for rationalisation in third level education. The idea that two small chemical engineering departments should be located down the road from each other, as we have in Cork, is ridiculous. The funding agent, which is the Government, should knock heads together and require a rationalisation. My understanding and experience of the Department of Education and Science — I have no idea what are the views of the current Minister — is that rationalisation usually means that the university grabs everything that is attractive and leaves other institutions to do the other bits, but that is not what I mean by rationalisation. Rather, we need a putting into practice of the rhetoric about ITs being equal but different. Unless that happens, we will have serious problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">On the issue of how third level education should be paid for, the Minister should not believe too much of the universities' propaganda about their wonderful fundraising capacity. They are very good at talking about the large amounts of private funding they have raised, but the vast majority of that funding came from one foundation. That foundation's first rule is that it must take the initiative, so I do not know how the universities can claim the credit for obtaining €600 million from Atlantic Philanthropies. The universities had nothing to do with that because Atlantic Philanthropies specifically forbids institutions from approaching it. If universities approach the foundation directly, Atlantic Philanthropies will not have anything more to do with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The only way to fund third level education is through general taxation. Introducing fees would immediately create a huge gap between the rich and the not so rich. Introducing significant fees into medicine would immediately prohibit large sections of society from accessing that education. Any sort of universal fees-based system for masters degrees, which I believe will become the standard qualification within the next ten years, will also exclude people. Given the evidence that the abolition of fees in the institutes of technology has produced significantly increased levels of participation, it would be a pity if either ideology or a shortsighted view of where money should be spent resulted in us reintroducing a dual system under which people first gained a basic and valueless first degree and were then unable to continue further because of the level of fees that had been introduced for later stages.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_366">I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend her on introducing the new funding arrangement. Although the thinking on that started back in 1997, the Minister grasped the nettle by introducing a strategic innovation fund with the sole objective of promoting change and transformation in third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Today's debate is about both third level education funding and the reform of our medical schools. The first issue needs a full debate for itself so I think it a pity that the two issues were combined for today's debate. It is important that we are able to make points about where we go from here with funding, but we also need to discuss the reform of our medical schools so the Minister must forgive me if I do not say too much about the funding issue. We will no doubt return to that at another time when the Higher Education Authority makes proposals on the criteria for how funding should be allocated to third level and fourth level education and on how we should allocate the huge amounts of investment being made in research and grant schemes. Returning to a pet subject of mine, I think we will also need to consider promoting some of our institutes into universities. We certainly need a university in the south east to tackle what went wrong with the distribution of universities in the past. Waterford should not be penalised because of that situation and we now have an opportunity to deal with that. We will return to this when there is more time to debate the subject seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Today, I prefer to discuss the Fottrell report. The report is well put together. Unfortunately, I only have time to deal with the recommendations but I intend to return to this report and discuss it in greater detail. The recommendations relate to how we reform our medical schools and examine the gaps that have existed for the past number of years. In 1978 a cap was put on the intake of students into medical school and it has not changed since then. Medical education was financed by increasing the number of non-EU students. Something had to give when the gap between supply and demand became huge. There was great demand for doctors and consultants but most of our doctors left the country when they qualified. They distinguished themselves well because of the quality of our medical education.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">How can we lure these people back and open up the system? I congratulate the Minister on opening the discussion on the recommendations in the Fottrell report. The recommendations relate to student intake, curriculum reform, funding and the assessment of students who enter by different paths. It is great that the numbers will be increased from 305 to 725 over a four-year period in steps of 70, 40, 35 and 35. It is nice to see such clarity about the increase in numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The points will also be reduced to 450. That will remove the stress from the second level sector. Of late, some second level schools have tended to become grind schools, particularly at senior cycle, whose purpose is to maximise the achievement of points. That has had a significant impact on the education of young people. That is not how education should be but the points system and the CAO process have dictated it. I am glad the Minister intends to move forward from that. How to devise a system that will work will be a major problem. I do not know if we will get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">There is also the issue of curriculum reform. If we increase the intake of students, it will be necessary to increase the number of academic clinicians and the number of teaching hospitals. At mid-stream the students' medical education moves into the hospitals. This was always on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but it must be tightened up and structured. This is also true of the funding. Until now, I understood that most of the money was allocated from the Department of Education and Science and that a certain amount came from the Department of Health and Children. The same amount of money should come from both Departments given that half of the education takes place in the medical school while the other half is conducted in the hospitals. The funding has not been tidied up over the years so perhaps the Minister will examine this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">My pet subject is the assessment of applicants. I often think of the students who wanted to do medicine and who repeated the leaving certificate time and again. Maybe they got between 490 and 520 points and found, for the third time, that they were unable to get through. It was awful, to say the least. I am glad there is an effort to tackle it but the jury is out on how to do so. What methods should be used?</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Aptitude tests were mentioned during the debate. They can be the fairest way of making a determination; there is no influence. However, aptitude tests are like crosswords in that if one practises them enough, one will become good at them. I have administered aptitude tests and one often finds there are 5% who never get them right but who are very good students. How to evaluate suitability for entry into any course is a big issue and I do not know if we can get it right in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Senator Henry mentioned that 570 points are required for veterinary medicine. Prospective radiography students must secure 510 points. They must be the cream of the country to do radiography. I do not deny that it is a good course but it does not warrant those points, no more than veterinary medicine or medicine warrants 570 points. In the past, some members of my family studied medicine. They were just about able to get into college but became very good general practitioners. Now, some general practitioners are bored with their lives because they are too bright for what they are doing and would prefer to be doing something else. This is a serious issue that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">What is wrong with an interview? I see nothing wrong with it. Of course, it must be fair and transparent. If one comes from a medical background, knows what is involved from a young age, is not terribly bright but would be a very good doctor, why not accept such applicants? We should not rule out the option of an interview. The same is true of any other profession. Take, for example, politicians who come from a political background. They have to be good when they get into politics but they know what they are facing when they enter politics. Other professionals whose children are anxious to get into the same profession can also find it difficult. However, I hope there would not be another type of elitist discrimination whereby somebody who comes from a medical background must get into medicine. That is not the way it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I could discuss this subject for a long time but I cannot. Funding is an important issue with regard to the entry of graduates. It is a great move forward but how can we fund them if they have already gone through a third level primary degree course? How can they get through the system? The stakeholders must become involved and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders such as the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, the Higher Education Authority, the Health Service Executive and the expert group must be defined in detail. There must also be an outline of how the part-time graduates will get through the course.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">There is a great deal of work to be done. The Minister should not fast-track it but take it slowly. We have lived with the points system for the past 20 years. Now is the time for a change. If we get one aspect of it right, it must be the entry issue. I must conclude but I could talk for another half hour on this subject.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_378">I welcome Senator Ormonde's comments about a university for the south east. The Fottrell report analysing medical education in Ireland is welcome. This is the first time an inclusive review of this nature has been undertaken and it has been a worthwhile exercise. The report provides a platform for differently structured access to a professional education that equips young professionals and disposes them towards continual professional development when they enter employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Given the needs of society and the ever-changing patterns evident in other professions, it is clear that a fresh approach to medical education is needed. Similar changes are required in medical research and extending the knowledge base, which will call for ongoing reform in syllabi and curricula. It will call for change in other areas too.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">It will also call for a more diverse range of skills and understanding and a different sense of mission. We know that health issues are complex. The health service is struggling and costs are spiralling. However, we should not lose sight of the care of the individual patients, which should be at the centre of all our thinking about health services. Good medical education and quality health care are inextricably linked, a fact which we perhaps have not always recognised in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">We must change the structure of medical education. The current model of medical education for undergraduates has served a purpose and may do so in the future in a more limited fashion.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_384">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_385">That Seanad Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_386">—condemns the Government for its failure to provide any solution to the appalling problem of congestion on the M50, until 2008 at the earliest;</p>
          <p eId="para_387">—expresses its concern in relation to the Government's proposal to move to barrier-free tolling on the M50 by way of the introduction of multipoint tolling at various sections through its length;</p>
          <p eId="para_388">—notes the Government's failure to carry out a proper analysis of traffic management needs and future demand on the M50, prior to its announcement to expand tolling on this route;</p>
          <p eId="para_389">—further notes that the opening of the port tunnel will add thousands of additional vehicles to the M50;</p>
          <p eId="para_390">—condemns the current Government for its failure, since first taking office in 1997, to tackle congestion on the M50; and</p>
          <p eId="para_391">—expresses its deep concern with the inequitable roll-out of tolling nationally, which will penalise motorists by forcing them to pay several tolls on each journey, as will be the case on the Galway to Dublin route.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to the House and the decision to debate this very important motion. There is no doubt that this issue is of national concern. The current situation on the M50 affects a vast number of motorists who commute to our capital city every day. However, it also places a massive strain on the development of our business community, which pays expensive tolls but whose members sit in traffic queues for hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Congestion on the M50 is worsening, a situation this Government has allowed to develop through its incompetent and negligent handling of the issue. This situation has been bubbling over since the mid-1990s but the Minister for Transport has stalled repeatedly. He has done nothing to prevent this mess from developing. Last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts highlighted starkly the unforgivable mistakes made in respect of the M50 and the West Link toll bridge. This debacle goes back as far as 1987 when the Fianna Fáil-led Government of the day signed a bad deal with National Toll Roads, NTR, which is the operator of the West Link toll bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">This deal was politically naive and short-sighted. It effectively gave NTR a licence to print money, an opportunity it has exploited to the maximum degree possible. It now appears that the company will receive a further financial windfall of over €1 billion from hard-pressed taxpayers before this sorry fiasco draws to a close. No one disputes the fact that the 1987 deal with NTR was a bad one but we must move on from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">However, this Government appears set to introduce an equally poor tolling arrangement. NTR has exploited Irish motorists by squeezing every penny out of them for almost 20 years and the Government is setting itself up to do the same thing in a more exaggerated and punishing manner. It is disgraceful that the Government should attempt to do so. The Minister announced last week that the Government was preparing to buy out NTR and its contracts to provide tolling facilities on the M50. This appeared to be good news and a sign that hard-pressed motorists would finally receive some relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">However, like so many of this Government's initiatives, the devil is in the details, which are shocking. The Government now proposes to abolish tolls imposed by NTR and introduce a more expensive system of tolling. Under this proposal, we will move away from single-point tolling on the West Link toll bridge to multipoint tolling along the full length of the M50. No motorist using this route will escape the toll and it is likely that the cost of the toll will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Motorists using the M50 thought matters could not get any worse but they have. Matters have worsened considerably. How can the Government stand over this crazy policy? Motorists already pay through the nose through taxation, vehicle registration tax and rising fuel costs. Where is the justice in all of this? The Government's proposal amounts to double taxation and offers nothing to hard-pressed motorists. They have no guarantee that congestion on the M50 will ease. NTR has stated that even when the M50 upgrade is completed, congestion will not ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">A ludicrous situation now prevails whereby the Government is effectively attempting to tax motorists off the road. This may be a laudable aim in terms of reducing environmental pollution and dealing with our shortage of road space but the Government must be realistic. Motorists use their cars, particularly for travelling to work, because there is no alternative. The Government has failed to put in place the public transport alternatives that are needed to allow people to leave their cars at home. This new toll amounts to a tax on work and putting the horse before the cart because it is being introduced in the absence of any comprehensive public transport system in our capital city and throughout the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">If the Minister was serious about persuading people to leave their cars at home and stay off routes like the M50, he would have delivered on his transport commitments a long time ago. These commitments have been promised since this tired and jaded Government took office nine years ago. The Government's fatigue is obvious to all. Where are the 180 additional buses which were promised for Dublin Bus, which intended to expand its network across the city? The Minister is awaiting another study on this issue but he does not need one. Instead, we see bus lanes lying empty because there are no buses to use them. Where is the metro, which was promised in the programme for Government? It was meant to run from Dublin Airport to Dublin city from 2007 but is now a distant dream. The list goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Instead, Transport 21 has been produced. This is a pipe dream containing policy proposals which were promised years ago but which this Government has consistently failed to deliver. My concern is that Transport 21 will end up gathering dust, like so many other strategies announced by the Government, and become a distant memory in the Government's mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">We now witness an incredible situation whereby the Government will be forced to pay over €1 billion to NTR to compensate it for the move to electronic tolling. In addition, the M50 upgrade will cost another €1 billion. This is a considerable amount of money, which must be paid by taxpayers. The Taoiseach may throw his hands up in despair and say that a deal is a deal and that there is nothing the Government can do other than pay up and shut up in respect of compensation for NTR.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, has highlighted the fact that compensation for NTR is not totally clear-cut. A concise reading of the contract signed in 1987 and again in 2001 reveals that NTR has a duty of care in respect of its management of the West Link toll bridge which it is not living up to. There is no doubt that the barriers at the West Link toll bridge contribute to congestion on the M50 yet the company has been slow to move to electronic tolling, which could have alleviated delays. The breach of this clause of its contract could leave NTR liable to pay compensation to the State. Neither the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, nor the National Roads Authority appear willing to pursue this avenue. It is disgraceful that they are willing to roll over and meekly pay a massive amount of compensation to the tune of €1 billion to National Toll Roads. This should be reconsidered.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Last week's announcement by the Minister regarding the tolling of the M50 was shambolic to say the least, as well as utterly confusing. The Minister announced that motorists on the M50 will have to move to barrier-free multipoint tolling along its length. However, he was unable to provide any finer detail on the matter. This was a result of the Minister jumping ahead and announcing something he had failed to work out himself, as is usually the case with him. When the Taoiseach moved to intervene and put out the fire of condemnation which met the announcement, he confirmed what we had all suspected, namely, that the Minister did not have any comprehensive proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The Taoiseach appeared on one side to promise motorists that tolls would be gone by the year 2008, or even before that. There were no guarantees, however. With regard to the future of the M50 and the involvement of National Toll Roads, it has been confirmed that the matter will get much worse over the coming years. National Toll Roads has confirmed that it expects thousands of extra heavy goods vehicles to spill on to the M50 once the Dublin Port tunnel opens later this year. The year 2008 is no longer the crisis year for motorists stuck in traffic, as it will happen much sooner, when the port tunnel opens. The opening of the port tunnel, in addition to the M50 upgrade works over the next five years that will turn the motorway into a construction site, will mean the daily misery endured by motorists will get much worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The most disturbing of last week's revelations on the M50 issue is that the National Roads Authority has not been in touch with National Toll Roads to discuss how both are going to deal with the impact of increased traffic passing through the West Link bridge and along the M50. There has been no communication, no strategy and no plan. No wonder the public has lost all confidence in the Minister for Transport. He is offering no worthwhile solutions on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In the short term, even before the proposed State buy-out of the West Link bridge in 2008, we need to make changes on the M50 to ensure a greater flow of traffic. Fine Gael proposes that in light of the exceptional return NTR has made on this public infrastructure investment, the Government should request a number of concessions from the company to ease the burden of cost on the drivers using the bridge. These include the following: freezing the toll charges at the 2004 level; making NTR fund the introduction of electronic tolling technology and for it to be in place by 2008; and the opening up of the West Link bridge at exceptionally busy periods to allow a freer flow of traffic. The number and duration of these free-flow periods could be considered in consultation with the DTO, the AA and the local authorities involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The West Link bridge user is currently the only interested party not benefiting from the arrangements in place. National Toll Roads is reaping massive profits, the Government is taking in €23 million per year in fees, taxes and rates but the ordinary private or commercial driver is being hit by a double blow of increasing tolls and delays at peak times.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">It is time for the Minister for Transport to reconsider the Government's general policy on tolling throughout Ireland. There are currently four toll roads and it is proposed to toll another five routes throughout the country. I strongly question the credibility of this strategy. By opting for private sector involvement in our roads building programme, are we setting up private operators to again collect buckets of cash from motorists?</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The rationale for private sector involvement was perhaps once viable because we did not have the capital finances as a State to bankroll such costly projects. However, times have moved on and we now live in a wealthy State. Last year the budget surplus was €2.5 billion. Surely some of this could have been invested in a road building programme. I am concerned that by proceeding down the current route we are setting ourselves up for costly and rising tolls well into the future. We do not want a scenario mirroring the M50 to emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The motion also raises the question of equity.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">It cites the example of a motorist driving from Galway to Dublin. If the current tolling proposals proceed, motorists may have to pass between three and four tolls before reaching their final destination. It is too much to ask of any motorist, who is already contributing heavily to the Government through motor tax and VRT. It will cripple business and hamper the growth of businesses in the regions. The policy of tolling bypasses such as the Fermoy bypass, soon to open in County Cork, is equally questionable.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I second the motion put forward by my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, and others. We have chosen to use Private Members' time tonight to debate this very important issue, which has ramifications not just for Dublin city and the surrounding region, but also for the country, as the Senator indicated at the end of his contribution. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for participating in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Minister is in the eye of the storm at the moment, a storm of his making and choosing. He was unceremoniously slapped down by the Taoiseach in the other House last week, and he should reflect on what has happened over the past fortnight. Even if he had nothing to say when he appeared on RTÉ to tell us the great news approximately two weeks ago, he should have at least stated that a comprehensive study is going ahead. That is reflected in the Government amendment tonight. It states that Seanad Éireann "welcomes the comprehensive traffic study on the M50 which the NRA will now carry out". That is great. It also states that Seanad Éireann "notes that following the completion of the study, the NRA will submit specific proposals for the free-flow tolling of the M50 with approval from the Government". That is also great.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This is what the Government has to offer us after nine years in office. I heard the Minister's musing on the Pat Kenny radio show this morning. One would think he was not part of the Government or an operation that was in place for the past nine years knowing that the crisis was building up year on year for the last six or seven years. The Government cannot offer us a solution until 2008, and in the meantime there will be another round of fascinating and comprehensive reports considering the crisis that is on the M50 on a daily basis. The problem is of the Minister's making, and the reason he was diminished by the Taoiseach's remarks in the other House is because he popped up making comments that were clearly ill-thought out, which did not have the support of his own party and which he has been trying to elude since.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Senator Paddy Burke referred to two important issues which I wish to hear the Minister comment on tonight. One relates to contracts. There was a contract in 1987, but there was also a contract in 2001. It is clear there is a contractual obligation on the service provider, which is NTR, as my colleagues in the other House stated. This obligation was entered into in 1987 and confirmed in 2001, and it requires NTR to provide facilities "which are adequate, having regard to the volume of traffic using the toll road".</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Minister has stated his hands are tied and he cannot act to enforce this specific standard. He has never tried, and he has not once taken legal proceedings against NTR. Last year he had the audacity to increase the toll charge by approximately 15% because the company had asked him to. It is a bit rich for the Minister now to present himself as the champion of the Irish motorist and the person who will now solve the problem. He has never once attempted to take the NTR to task using the legal options that were available from 1987 and 2001. He claims that the obligations under the PPP contract are much more accurate and advanced than in the previous contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I am also interested to hear the Minister's reply to the issue raised by Senator Burke. NTR conceded to the Committee of Public Accounts last week that the NRA had had no discussions with it on how best to handle the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_421">If it is rubbish the Minister will put it on the record of the House rather than muttering from the other side. If it is true it amounts to another breach of faith on the part of NTR, as well as another way in which the Minister failed to act on information when it first came to hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The situation in 12 months' time will certainly be much worse than now. There will be at least another 10,000 cars on the M50 and, as Senator Burke said, the Dublin Port tunnel will spew out 2,500 to 3,000 articulated lorries onto the M50 on a daily basis. However, the Government tells us the solution to this problem will emerge in 2008. The constituents I represent want to know what will happen today.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Some solutions can be advanced. The Minister has never once attempted to negotiate with NTR to take away the barriers at peak times, in line with an amendment on the Order Paper to which Senator Ross and Senator O'Toole referred. Never once has he demanded that the company remove the barrier at peak times in the morning and evening, even for one week. I suggested to the Minister more than five months ago, when the House last debated the issue, that the service provider should be obliged to raise the barriers when a substantial queue built up at the toll plaza so that motorists could immediately flow through. There are no contraflows on the most problematic junctions, between the N7 and the N4. Gardaí could be deployed at certain junctions in the morning to create two lanes onto the M50 as well as two lanes leading off in the evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">These measures could make some difference now, unlike his actual proposal. The Minister's big idea is for the people who live in west and south-west Dublin, of which I am one, and along the entire fringe of the M50, to buy out the National Toll Roads contract for the toll plaza. He is going back to the future. When the initial proposal was made to Dublin County Council over 20 years ago it was for gantries onto the M50 and there were protests in Clondalkin, Tallaght and Blanchardstown because people realised they would be taxed every time they went onto the M50, thus subsidising the buyout of the horrendous deal entered into by his party on two occasions, in 1987 and 2001. That will not be allowed to happen because people will not accept it and will stand up to it. He has created the problem and it is futile to blame other people.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss this important issue. I have only eight minutes but it would take considerably longer to refute some of the negativity and misrepresentation of the facts we have heard. We had a similar discussion here on 23 March 2005 on a motion tabled by Senator Ross. The big issue in the media and in the public mind at the time was the removal of the bottleneck at the West Link toll plaza because of the difficulties people experienced sitting for considerable time on the approaches to the bridges morning and evening. At no time during that debate did I hear anything about the cost of the toll. The problem, as perceived by me and by most people, was that people were paying for a poor service that was not in keeping with best practice and was downright inefficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">There has been significant improvement since then. The Minister has held discussions that were difficult and protracted, for obvious reasons. A private operator has a contract and I differ from the other side on the origins of that. The decision has now been taken to remove the toll plaza. I am not happy that it will be 2008 — like most people I would like it to be sooner — but there are difficult issues that need to be resolved. Until this problem surfaced there was no problem with the principle of tolling on the bridge or the M50. I have heard suggestions for barrier-free tolling at multiple points but a review is ongoing and a decision must be made on how such money can be collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The debate has now changed. A solution has been found to the removal of the blockade at the bridge and the Minister has made the correct decision. The NRA had progressed as far as it could with its negotiations with NTR and he could not allow the negotiations to continue so pulled the plug in line with the clause in the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I listened with interest to Senator Paddy Burke's revisionist view of how the contract with NTR came about. We only have to go back to 1987 because most of the negotiations took place between 1982 and 1987, involving the coalition Government at the time. I do not seek to apportion blame to the Government at the time or to the subsequent Government but we lived in a very different society and projections were that 25,000 vehicles would utilise that road in 2005. That has quadrupled, so that there were nearly 100,000 last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I could play politics and say the reason so many cars cross the West Link toll bridge in 2005 is that Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 have changed the economic fortunes of this country. There would be a large element of truth in that——</p>

          <p eId="para_440">——but I will not get into it. I will not swipe back with predictable negativity by suggesting it was a bad deal. It was a very good deal for the State at the time. The Minister might correct my figures but I understand the cost of €38 million amounted to approximately one third of what the country was spending at the time on its entire road programme. It is ridiculous to suggest this was a bad deal. In fact, for five or six years until 1995 it was a good deal. The numbers were short of the projections that NTR had made for 1991, 1992 and 1993 and the company was losing money and under financial pressure. Not until the economic policies of this and other Fianna Fáil-led Governments did the current situation arise. I do not suggest it was all our doing. International changes allowed us to reap the benefits of our policies but it is wrong to suggest this was a cosy deal whereby Fianna Fáil looked after NTR because the facts belie that suggestion. A legally binding agreement was negotiated by all the parties at the time and it provided very good value for money for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It is easy to look back and, with the wisdom of hindsight, suggest it should have been done differently. Now it will be done differently and the approach the Minister is taking is correct for that purpose. Local authorities were in such peril that they had to turn off street lights. In many areas, it seemed that lights had blown but that represented a decision by councils to remove every second bulb.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">There is talk that the Minister should take NTR to court. In the context of the heavy involvement of multinational companies in this economy, the State would do great damage to its credibility on the international stage, at a time when it is trying to encourage public private partnerships, if it was to renege on an agreement in order to pull a private company through the courts for political purposes. I do not want the Minister to take that step. A contract has been agreed to and NTR has to be compensated. Good luck to the company because it got it right. The reality is that the money collected through tolls will be required to pay compensation and to ensure that the M50 is upgraded. We have accepted tolling in other parts of the country and the people of the west and south should not pay for Dublin's difficulties.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_454">He leaves us with the feeling that he has done his best but is not really convinced of his arguments. In one of his first sentences, which was incredible enough to beggar belief, he said that a solution had been found. He went on to say that we discussed this very matter about this time last year. Given that we urged exactly the same solution when we last discussed it, it is nonsense to claim now that a solution has been found. A year later, we have in fact fallen two years back because the Minister, instead of taking immediate action upon coming to power, decided it was time for talks between the National Roads Authority, over which he exerts control, and National Toll Roads. The talks continued for months and, as anybody could have predicted, ended in deadlock. They were due to finish by the end of August but, because NTR is good at running rings around Ministers and the Government, they concluded ten days ago after they came to a deadlock, with NRA breaking off from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I do not blame NTR for dragging its feet in these talks for as long as possible while at the same time minting money. Any company with similar shareholders would probably regard it a duty to do so. However, it made a monkey of the Minister by continuing the talks for almost one year without allowing any achievements to be made. Meanwhile, the poor unfortunate commuters, who sat along the M50 during that period, continue to wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Minister, in a premature fiasco of a statement, announced that the plaza on the West Link toll bridge would be opened. Apparently, we were all meant to applaud but why should we do so? It will only be opened in two years' time. The significance of the date is that it will be on the other side of an election and the Government hopes, by reassuring people at the hustings this time next year that the plaza will be gone fairly soon, it will be able once again to make monkeys of the electorate. What will happen during those two years? Everybody knows that NTR will continue to milk motorists and the M50 will get worse. The Government will merely whisper sweet nothings in the ears of big business and say, "Do not worry, it will be all over in two years".</p>
          <p eId="para_457">It is not satisfactory because, as Senator Brian Hayes noted, more could have been done much earlier. This problem did not arise suddenly this year but has been building up over a long time and is the result of the original deal, a matter remarked upon today by a number of speakers. We should acknowledge Senator Dooley's points that the Roche family took a risk at the time and that nobody could have imagined the immeasurable rewards that would be reaped. However, he should not try to tell me that the original deal was good for the Government. Regardless of whether these people deserve their financial rewards — I believe they do not — the negotiators should not have agreed to give them a monopoly over that stretch of road. As a result, the suggestions that a second bridge can be built are null and void because it is legally binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">This deal sets standards which would not be acceptable today in any toll company and, as we heard from the NRA last week, it also sets down certain legally unenforceable terms. It was flawed and careless and it granted a monopoly. Let us stop saying the Government negotiated a good deal because the principles, standards and traffic forecasts were all wrong, although it should not necessarily be blamed for the latter and I concur with the Senator on the economy. The flaws in the deal were so fundamental that they should have been foreseen and prevented.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">A lot of passing the parcel has been conducted by people trying to disown the deal by blaming either the then coalition Government or Fianna Fáil. We should determine who signed the agreement because people who sign deals should take responsibility for them. It was signed by George Redmond for Dublin County Council and by Pádraig Flynn for his party.</p>

The Minister can do that and, second, he can set the toll at zero today. There is no need for a two year delay.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_467">We are back in this House tonight to discuss the vexed question of the M50. While I do not want to give a history lesson to some in this Chamber, it is important to note that when the M50 toll contract was signed, there was no monopoly because an outer ring road was planned for approximately two miles from the motorway. As people drive along the N7 today, they will see a large sign at Rathcoole referring to an outer ring road. That was the plan at the time but the county council in Dublin was split into three in 1994 and when the development plan for Fingal County Council was completed in 1999, the council voted, by 23 to one, to delete the bridge coming across from Woodies in Lucan. That is why there is an interchange at Woodies on the N4. It was designed to join up with the N7. That work has largely been done by South Dublin County Council and that council, since 1999, has merrily gone on planning its road infrastructure as it had been planned in the 1980s. I was the only councillor who said there should be a second crossing at that point but it was deleted from the plan by the council, with county management approval and against the wishes of the then Dublin Transportation Office. That decision gave a monopoly to the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Figures were produced and reports published when the upgrade of the M50 was first discussed at Fingal County Council five years ago. Councillors at that time were told that some 14,000 motorists — and the figure is probably 20,000 today — were travelling from Blanchardstown to Lucan, via the M50, every day. These motorists were causing enormous congestion on the N3 roundabout and more important, they were being forced to pay NTR for the privilege of crossing to Lucan, as their only alternative was to go through Chapelizod or Lucan village. That scenario was voted for by councillors, some of whom now sit in this Chamber. The point is that there was no monopoly initially, but one was given to NTR by the decisions I have just outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Nothing that I have heard today offers any solution in the next two years. However, a solution must be found for the short term, particularly in light of the opening of the port tunnel. When the original toll bridge was in place, up until 2001, there were four lanes on it, with a dual carriageway running in each direction across the Liffey. Mysteriously, when NTR built the second bridge, it reduced the four lanes to three, which is a complete waste of infrastructure. My solution, which would cost nothing in terms of additional infrastructure, is the reintroduction of four lanes on each section of the bridge. The most westerly northbound lane could be given over entirely to traffic coming from the Lucan and Kildare areas, given that it is estimated that between 20% and 25% of traffic travelling across the bridge comes from the N4. At present, if a motorist coming in from the N4 in the morning wishes to use Eazy Pass, he or she must cross the three lanes of the M50, slowing up all of the traffic. There should be a dedicated lane on the inside for such traffic, which would remove the need for motorists to weave and merge on the N4 interchange. This would cost nothing to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">As one drives along the N7 at present, beyond Naas, the traffic veers out into the northern lane of the N7 and a contra-flow lane operates for a section of the road for about a mile. I travelled that route last Sunday and asked myself why that could not be done on the bridge. Last September I proposed this on behalf of my party and I still do not understand why it cannot be done. I do not believe that anyone has a monopoly on wisdom on this issue and I have certainly heard little wisdom tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I heard the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, say in the Dáil last week that he would consider moving the toll plaza back towards Castleknock. That was part of the original NRA proposal for the upgrading of the M50 but it was lashed and removed from the plan because the plaza would be on top of people's houses, with attendant problems of lighting, pollution and so forth. If that is the Labour Party's solution, I am sure Deputy Burton will be very happy to inform the residents of that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">My suggestion is that, with no extra cost by way of infrastructure, we could have one-way tolling on the bridge and nobody would lose. When the original bridge was in place, motorists had to travel over the single bridge and weave through traffic to go through the southern or northern toll. In two years' time, when we start upgrading the M50, that will have to happen again. There will be tar barrels, cones and bollards along the M50 and, if it is going to be like the Naas road was, we must have controlled management of the motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The Minister should consider reversing six of the southbound lanes at the toll bridge, so that rather than having seven southbound and seven northbound lanes, we could have 13 northbound lanes, adding tremendously to the capacity on the M50. He could allow for free tolls for motorists heading south, reduce the northbound toll from €3.60 to €3.00, which is easier to collect and force NTR to advertise Eazy Pass packages. Proper demand management measures must be put in place. Users of the Luas pay in advance. In the same vein, there should be more use of Eazy Pass. People should be forced to use Eazy Pass and told they will have to queue if they do not do so. Equally, they should be told if they do use it, they will have an easier passage through the toll plaza. Demand management measures are essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The capacity of the M50 can be increased by introducing four lanes across both bridges, as was the case in the past and I urge the Minister to give consideration to that option.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_475">I wish to share my time with Senator Tuffy. A statement of principle is probably a good place to start. I do not have a problem, in principle, with tolls. Sometimes the impression is given that all Government politicians are in favour of tolls, so long as they are not in their own areas, and all Opposition politicians are against them. I do not have problem in principle with tolls but they must be reasonable. They cannot be put on one motorway and not on another and they should only apply to new roads. There will not be general public acceptance of the need to pay for roads if they are not new. However, if the road is new and the toll is proportionate and reasonably priced then I do not have a difficulty with the users of a stretch of motorway bearing some of the cost, provided the public-private partnership arrangements are appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">We have had various types of public-private partnership arrangements over the years and I hope to goodness we have got them right by now. I have certainly been hearing more positive news on that issue in recent times than was the case a few years ago, but we have made some mistakes in this area, as have other countries, it must be said. Either way, I do not have a difficulty, in principle, with tolls.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Committee of Public Accounts last week stated that the memo to Government in 1984, before the first bridge was built, pointed out that tolling ring-roads was not customary in Europe. There was a good reason for that. We have heard the argument already so I will not rehash it, but if people are being tolled for a relatively short journey to work twice daily, it is different from tolling journeys between Dublin and other cities and we should not be doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">We must now find the most reasonable solution and I agree that we must move to barrier-free tolling. However, I do not understand why it must take until 2008 and why we must wait another year before we get the legislation to achieve that. I accept the principle that it must be done by electronic recognition of registration plates or an Eazy Pass system and that the notion of nationalising the 3 km of the M50 that we do not own is unrealistic because we should not visit that cost on the taxpayer. However, I am at a loss to understand why, given the reasonable degree of consensus, it has taken us so long to arrive at where we are now, a general acceptance in principle that we must do away with the barriers. That is all we have agreed so far, there is nothing beyond that. Surely we could have achieved more by now.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The HGV management plan published by Dublin City Council before Christmas acknowledged, as we all knew, that there is little point in putting in place a toll strategy on the Dublin Port tunnel which is intended to oblige HGVs to use it while charging them up to €7 a few kilometres up the M50. It is clear that if the HGV management plan for the port tunnel is to work, we must have in place a system where the barriers are raised but no serious talks are taking place with National Toll Roads. Given the need for a decision, the matter requires the intervention of the Minister as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">I mentioned last week that the Minister made an announcement but we are yet to see the details of the proposal. If the Government does anything, however, it should scrutinise proposed expenditure in a way similar to what the Committee of Public Accounts does after the money is spent, where often it finds there are serious problems with the figures. There must be pre-evaluation because there is no point making the big announcement if the system to implement it is wrong. It is Labour Party policy to introduce a system to independently evaluate large-scale expenditure before the money is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I live in mid-west Dublin, an area that includes Lucan and Clondalkin, and the Minister's plans will have an impact on us. If other tolls are introduced on the M50, what will happen on those roads that are not tolled? People will avoid the tolls, particularly because they have used the M50 in one direction where there is no toll. Those people will not accept the principle of having to pay a toll on an old road. They will avoid that road, with a resultant impact on roads in Lucan, Clondalkin and Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The Minister appeared on "Today with Pat Kenny" this morning, saying that he would not introduce congestion charging until public transport options exist. If the Minister does anything for mid-west Dublin, he should give priority to the Kildare route project and give Dublin Bus the extra buses it needs for additional services and new routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Only yesterday I was talking to people who have been taking the bus for many years from Clondalkin to Peamount Hospital where they work. The people who got that bus are passed at their usual stop because the bus is full. When the issue is raised with Dublin Bus, the company states that it does not have the resources to put extra buses on the route and there is nothing it can do. Dublin Bus must be given the buses promised in the national development plan. While I would like to see Luas and metro arrive in Lucan, it is not even on the drawing board, while both Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann have concrete proposals and infrastructure for the Kildare route project that would benefit many people. It was supposed to be finished in 2005.</p>

        <speech by="#DiarmuidWilson" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_487">We did not have to pull screens around at our Ard-Fheis to pretend there was a crowd.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The M50 upgrade will see the five kilometre section from the N7 to the N4 increase from four to six lanes, with free-flowing interchanges at the Red Cow, Liffey Valley and Ballymount roundabouts. Work will shortly commence and will be completed within two years. With the Naas Road widening project and the upgrade of the N2 and N3, this will deliver improvements for road users. The move from four to six lanes and the new interchanges will improve average peak hour speeds, reduce congestion on radial routes and improve traffic flow on the entire Dublin road network. Surely that is welcome news, particularly for those using the M50. Some people are concerned about delays while the work is carried out and it will be important to maintain traffic flow but that is the only concern I have heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Senator Morrissey informed me that National Toll Roads built 3.2 kilometres of the M50, including three other bridges apart from the West Link itself. While a Fianna Fáil Minister may have signed the contract, major projects of this nature are not put together in six months. I will take Senator Ross's advice that it is necessary to be factual about the contract. Although it was formally signed by Pádraig Flynn, a Minister in a subsequent Government, the contract was prepared by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government of the time. Senator Ross's former party cannot wash its hands of that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Senator Bradford stated that Cavan people might not pay tolls. The people of Cavan would gladly pay tolls to travel to Dublin on the M3 if it was constructed. Part of the responsibility for delaying the road lies with some of the Opposition Senators who, shrouded in straitjackets of pomposity, pontificate to a Minister who is attempting to improve the conditions of the travelling public throughout the Twenty-six Counties. In this respect, I welcome Transport 21 but we will discuss that on another day. Members of the Opposition are assisting individuals who are taking court cases against the Government and NRA to prevent the M3 from being constructed. In doing so, they are delaying vital infrastructure for the people of counties Cavan, Fermanagh, Leitrim and Meath. The M3 is needed to allow the people of these counties to use the M50. The current road, the N3, is the artery we must travel to reach Dublin because we do not have any other infrastructure such as railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The opponents of the road can jump a DART train, Luas tram, bus or taxi and sit back in their cosy Georgian houses or seaside retreats in Bray, while the people of counties Cavan, Meath, Leitrim and Fermanagh use a dirt track to travel to the capital city and its ports and airport. That is the reality for the people of the north midlands and north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I congratulate the Minister and his officials on their decision to upgrade the M50. Let us cut out the nonsense and get the M3 constructed. The people of Cavan will be glad to pay any tolls charged to use the road because the time saved will save money, which we like to do.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_495">The Senator may be called upon in the national interest. I have listened with interest to the debate. Senator Wilson referred to the Transport 21 plan, which the House has debated and to which I do not propose to revert. I trust that any Minister, regardless of the Department in which he or she serves, will want to do a good job and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is attempting to establish a national transport system which will work. Transport and health are the two areas of Government policy in which considerable investment has been made without clear results. This is the reason the debate is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The Minister should listen carefully to Senators' comments, particularly the ideas Senators Morrissey and McDowell put forward from their respective local positions.</p>
        </speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_498">Prosperity and economic success have resulted in a significant increase in the number of cars on the roads. It is a matter of concern that the number of cars here <i>per capita</i> remains low when compared to other European Union member states. This means congestion problems will worsen as the number of cars on the roads increases in the next ten to 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Few of us would have expected traffic jams to supersede the weather as the main topic of conversation for many people. I recall that in the days before the introduction of Sky Sports, soccer fans had to listen to BBC Radio 2 on Saturdays. It was while listening to this station that I first heard traffic reports. I never expected we would ever have traffic jams here. Traffic congestion on our roads has become a crucial national issue, both from an economic perspective and in terms of the major social problems it causes. For this reason, it must be urgently addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The statistics on the cost of the M50 to motorists and the significant sums being generated by road tolling oblige us to reflect on our approach to road tolls. We need a national debate on the issue. Like Senator McDowell, I do not have hard and fast views on whether tolls are a good or bad idea. Given the clear need to build more roads, the question is how they should be funded. In the mid to late 1980s no one foresaw how much money would be collected by National Toll Roads. The West Link, which cost €38 million to build, will have raised more than €1 billion by 2020. Perhaps we should have had greater vision at the time but no one envisaged that the bridge would generate this kind of money. It is important, therefore, that we now ask what is the best way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The prospect of new tolls being introduced is a cause of major concern. Senator McDowell asked when I would raise the issue of the Fermoy bypass. The Minister will be aware of the position in Fermoy, a town in my former Dáil constituency. A road, which was originally designed as a bypass of the town, has become part of the much larger Cork to Dublin motorway. The decision to place toll booths just outside the town has caused considerable local unease because it will result in cars diverting into the town to avoid the toll plaza. The National Roads Authority has indicated that up to 40% of cars using the motorway will make a diversion, which would be a disappointing development. If this estimate reflects the future scale of the problem in Fermoy, it raises concerns about the scale of future problems in larger cities, particularly in the Dublin region if drivers are required to pay tolls at two or three points on the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The tolling system needs to be examined. Contracts signed with National Toll Roads clearly cannot be cast aside and negotiations with the company will be necessary. The option of replacing toll charges with a levy on petrol and dieselmust be considered. The House has already debated shadow tolling, which involves removing barriers and billing drivers who pass a toll. An alternative to this approach would be to raise the necessary funding by other means. Although it is universally accepted that roads will not be built free of charge, the current system is unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">While, like Senator Wilson, I do not travel the M50 every day, the queues are of a scale that we cannot allow. We are beginning to appreciate the level of frustration and anger felt by motorists and we must respond to it. Although I wish I had the solution, I do not. What has happened over the past five or six years cannot be repeated. Since it is not sustainable to allow more and more traffic to build up at these tolling booths, new solutions are required. The idea that people who live in certain areas and who travel along the M50 might have to pay a number of tolls per day is not only politically unacceptable but wrong on every count.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">As the Minister tries to proceed with the national transport plan and put in place a mechanism to spend the €34 billion, which is an enormous sum, we must ensure it is done in such a way that gives value for money and does not create these huge bottlenecks. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours but over the past five to ten years we have seen a system that does not work and urgently needs to be reviewed. The public representatives for the Dublin region understand better than I that the issue of traffic jams and transport management has become almost No. 1 on the political agenda, and consumers and constituents will demand a political response. The Minister must insist that the NRA urgently reviews the situation where planned bypasses end up with toll plazas. Being parochial again, this is an issue not just in Fermoy but in towns across the country.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I would like to share my time with Senator Kitt. I welcome the Minister and commend him for grasping the nettle of this awful problem of the M50 tolling and the traffic jams there every evening. I have listened to this evening's debate and I like it when the Opposition takes over because it has all the answers. It has fantastic questions and answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">When I was a member of the former Dublin County Council from 1991 to 1993 and a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition was in control, no budget was provided for the lighting of the M50 and the toll plaza. Nothing has been said about that. When the deal was negotiated we had high unemployment and it was a good deal at the time. If the Opposition had been in Government it would have done the same. Liam Kavanagh was the Minister preparing these plans originally from 1984 to 1986. The Opposition should not pretend they know all the answers or that if it had beenin Government this situation would not have arisen. Nobody could have known by how much traffic would increase between 1995 and today. Only now do we see that we should have done it much earlier and we have now tackled the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">It is important to get the M50 upgrade right. We all know mistakes can be made but we must get it right. The Minister is right to establish this study with the NRA before we can come to any arrangements. I welcome the fact that all the stakeholders are involved in this approach. It is important that we include the Department of Transport, Dublin City Council, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Port Company to ensure that all the agencies develop a co-ordinated traffic plan. That is the only way we can move forward to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">We are sorting out the problems with the Red Cow roundabout. The only way is to take it slowly. There is no quick answer. If there were, does the Opposition think the Government would not have moved like a shot on it? One cannot do it immediately. There are legally binding agreements. The decision to end the tolling and establish a traffic study is positive. The public welcomes it and accepts that the decisions must be taken slowly. This operation cannot be fast-tracked. The Minister must go about his business despite criticism. He is doing a good job and I wish him well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the Minister, particularly what he has said in a definite statement that work will shortly commence on phase 1 of the M50 upgrade. I have known the Minister down the years and he has always given us dates when we have looked for infrastructure development. In developing the western rail corridor he gave dates when the railway would come to various parts of the west. He is doing the same regarding this upgrade.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I welcome the fact that there will be barrier-free tolling. I am not as familiar with the road as the Dublin Members. For me it is a handy way to get to Croke Park; thanks be to God Galway has been there either for hurling or football in the last few years, and hopefully it will be again. I am sure the Minister will use the same road in the future. The Minister's statement on the upgrade and barrier-free tolling is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The Fine Gael motion mentions the Galway to Dublin route and one would think from reading it that everybody sets out from Galway city to Dublin. That is not the case. Many of us live in east Galway. One would also think there is some compunction to use the toll road. While I welcome the new road from Kinnegad to Dublin, many bus operators use the old route because it suits passengers and they are free to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Some enterprising people have put up signs advertising that one can have breakfast or lunchtoll free on the old road. While we have this excellent road, on which it is a joy to drive — and drive safely, an important issue — there is an option to travel on the old route. There is no place to stop for food on the road from Kinnegad and Dublin. I presume when the new road goes all the way to Galway there will be. That is an important side issue because people must take a break if they are driving a long way. It must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The most important issue is that there is €34 billion for the transport plan. The Minister has ensured that much of that funding will go to the development of good, safe roads, has given dates for other development and has given assurances on what is happening on phase 1 of the M50 upgrade. I welcome what is happening on transport. As part of the Galway to Dublin route the Minister recently opened the Loughrea bypass, a stretch of road that had been planned for 30 years. People from the west, particularly from Galway city, can get to the midlands and Dublin by a quicker and safer route. Loughrea was choked due to serious traffic problems that went on for over 30 years. I welcome the announcement and hope this issue of the M50 and the other issues on the Galway to Dublin route will be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_516">This issue has been around for quite a while and is a developing scandal. I am not interested in who is responsible and whether it was a Labour Party Minister who signed the agreement. We have a problematic situation and should address it. I raised this matter on 10 June 2003 as a result of an experience I had going through the toll bridge. At the time I said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_517">A recent journey took me across the West Link toll bridge. There are ten lanes through which vehicles may pass at the tollbooth. On the day in question, the first lane was closed, the next three were Eazy Pass only, no change was given at the next lane, the next two lanes were also Eazy Pass, there was a girl in the next lane putting money into a basket and the last lane had no markings. I went right across to the girl with the basket, but she would not give me any change. It may seem silly, but if every second person is giving 70 cent to National Toll Roads, it will make a huge amount of money. It has already swindled the people of Ireland by having its free run at the toll bridge extended. We should consider this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I was not raising the parsimonious Protestant view that I was giving 70 cent to the owners of the toll bridge; I was also dealing with the question of safety. It was dreadful, the signage was bad and I needed to zigzag across several lanes to get to the badly-marked toll booth.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">As far as I am concerned National Toll Roads is buccaneering at this stage. It is shameless. It knows it is squeezing the people and it is arrogant and unrepentant. The demeanour of its representatives before committees of the Oireachtas is appalling. They simply dismissed us. All the time we hear about €10 million here and €5 million there and what it could be used for in our hospitals. Has NTR no conscience? What about the application to which the taxpayers' money could be put if they did not have to waste all this money on these toll roads? The worst aspect seems to be the claim it is making that if the Government buys it out, under EU law it is still entitled to tender for the contract. We could buy it out, give it a present of hard cash and find it continuing to rob us. That is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">While I am not suggesting there are easy solutions, certain things could be done. For example, let us consider what was done in France. The national autoroute 6 going south from Paris has a large toll plaza for traffic in one direction and a few miles further down the road it has another plaza for traffic in the opposite direction. Why not use the existing West Link plaza for traffic in one direction and perhaps on the other side of the bridge have a plaza for traffic in the opposite direction, which would free up the entire thing?</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I thank Senator Norris for giving me time to speak in this debate. We must make a clear distinction. It is one matter to build a motorway and announce well ahead of time that it will be tolled. It is understandable and I have no objection to it. However, it is a problem to build a motorway, have people build houses and come to live in the area and then to spring on them that the system will change and they will face different costs. I believe this is why people are up in arms over the proposal that has now been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">There are two schools of thought as to whether we should have tolls. One states that the taxpayer, as we did for many years, should pay from a central purse for the cost of roads. The other states that, as with the polluter pays principle, those who use it should pay. I tend towards the second opinion. I believe it is right to have tolls. In my experience it is possible to change behaviour on the basis that people must pay, of which I am in favour. However, I have great reservations about the lack of imagination among those involved. One relates to the pricing, to which I will return, and the other is the collection. The Minister is right: with modern technology it is outrageous to think about the old-fashioned way in which we still collect tolls. I have seen the systems in operation in Singapore and other parts of the world and the Minister has spoken about them here. We must move in that direction as it does not make sense to do otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">However, much greater lack of imagination applies to pricing. In almost every business of which I am aware, more frequent users who are better customers pay a lower charge and the occasional users who are poor customers pay a higher price. The Fine Gael motion refers to the journey from Dublin to Galway. Whatever about that journey, what is important is the person who uses the M50, 40 times a month getting to and from work. This is a much more important element and such motorists should pay a much lower rate than those people who only use the road occasionally coming up to watch Galway play in Croke Park, which is probably very seldom nowadays. Those taking shorter journeys should pay a higher price than those taking longer journeys. This would mean that a driver going the whole way from Dublin to Galway would pay a lower rate — although not necessarily a lower toll — than a driver only going part of the way. On the Continent and elsewhere such a system applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Heavy goods vehicles are price sensitive and I still see large trucks, some driver-owned and some owned by the larger companies, which avoid the expense of toll roads in order to travel on roads not built for them and through villages and towns not built for them. This has many implications. It is a much more expensive way to travel. It is also much more dangerous and is damaging to the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The Minister should consider banning or providing incentives to prevent heavy goods vehicles from using those roads that are not suitable for them when a toll road is available to them. This could be done either by applying a ban or by pricing in a manner that makes it much more acceptable for them to use toll roads. The reasons do not just relate to safety and damage to the roads. They include the cost to the economy as a whole. It costs far more to use lower grade roads to transport goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I will leave those thoughts with the Minister. The issue needs careful consideration. I am not proposing the answer. I do not know whether heavy goods vehicles should be banned or whether they should be encouraged by pricing to ensure they use the toll roads and main roads built for them and not other roads that were not built for them.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_146" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_530">As I came over to this debate in Seanad Éireann, I wondered whether I had missed some fact, issue of substance or policy idea that might not have been considered. As colleagues know, I always enjoy the debate in this House, which is always of a very high quality. I was particularly concerned that those who have been to the fore in discussing this issue, either orally or in written form, would bring something substantive to the debate. I need not have had any such concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I thank those on both sides of the House who have dealt with the facts and proposed ideas constructively, asked questions quite legitimately and have sought answers. I have always been comfortable and happy to be in that space regardless of how difficult the questions are or how big the challenge is. I am driven by making decisions and finding solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I am glad of the opportunity which this motion provides to set out the position regarding the upgrade of the M50 and the broader programme of investment in transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area. I hope that by the time I am finished many of the questions will have been answered. The existing M50 ring road is the result of more than three decades of planning and construction during a period in which Dublin and the country as a whole have experienced significant economic development and change. As a result the Dublin road network has experienced massive traffic growth and the M50 is now the busiest section of road in Ireland. The increase in our car ownership rates and changes in travel patterns have resulted in major congestion occurring during peak times on many parts of the Dublin road network, including the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The upgrade scheme will have significant benefits for road users as it will expand the capacity of the M50 to deal with 50% more traffic than at present, improve average peak hour speeds, reduce traffic congestion on the radial routes and improve traffic flow on the whole of the Dublin road network. With the full upgrade of the M50, average traffic speeds on the wider Dublin road network are predicted to increase by up to 9% in the morning peak hour and up to 12% in the off-peak periods over the first year of operation in 2010 compared with a situation where the scheme is not upgraded. The opening last year of the final link of the M50 south-eastern motorway delivered major benefits, and we will shortly see the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The completion of these projects, along with the Naas Road widening and the upgrade projects on the N2, will deliver important improvements to the capital's road network and is further evidence of what the Government is working to achieve, namely, a high-quality network providing reduced journey times and greater journey time certainty to support development and underpin competitiveness. This development in the road network will be complemented by significant development in public transport to which I will refer later.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The M50 upgrade scheme is being planned in two phases and involves the widening of approximately 31 km of the motorway from two to three lanes in each direction, from the M50-M1 interchange near Dublin Airport through to the Sandyford interchange and the upgrade of ten junctions along this length. Phase 1 of the scheme, the contract for which was recently signed and which will commence construction in a matter of weeks, is being delivered by means of a design and build contract and involves the widening of the carriageway to three lanes between the Red Cow, N7, the Galway road, N4 roundabouts and the upgrading of the interchanges. This phase is to be completed by mid-2008 and is being funded by the Exchequer. Phase 2 is being procured as a PPP contract and involves the widening of the remainder to three lanes and the upgrade of other interchanges. I understand that the contract for this phase is expected to be awarded in April 2007 with construction to be completed in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">A crucial element of the M50 upgrade scheme is the installation of barrier-free tolling. As I have stated on a number of occasions, my objective is to secure significantly enhanced capacity and an increased level of service on the M50 for road users, including through an early move to barrier-free tolling. I welcome, therefore, the decision by the National Roads Authority to terminate discussions with National Toll Roads regarding the West Link and to effectively begin the process of removing the West Link toll plaza and its replacement by a free flow toll arrangement. I understand that the NRA will be undertaking, in the course of this year, a comprehensive traffic study as a basis for deciding the details of the free flow tolling arrangements, including the toll level and the technology to be used. The NRA will then submit its specific proposals for the free flow toll arrangement for Government approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It is a legal requirement, as part of the planning permission granted by the local authority and as a condition of the upgrade of the M50, that a full free flow demand management study be carried out on the M50. This was not something invented in the past few days or thrown into the pot. It was the local authority councillors, the majority of whom are Labour Party and Fine Gael councillors, and good luck to them, who put that in as part of the planning requirements and the conditions of allowing the upgrade to go ahead. That is a statement of fact which is being ignored by many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I welcome and agree with that policy approach because having completed a €1 billion upgrade on the M50, we never want to return to the type of congestion that exists today. If we are to be upfront and honest about this, we need to know well into the future the extent of the traffic on the M50 and how to ensure from everybody's perspective, including, specifically, the road users, that they will have a good free flow system on that piece of motorway permanently into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I want to make it clear that the free flow toll arrangement in 2008 will be a single point toll, that the toll will be set at a level equivalent to today's level, index linked, and will fund phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the cost of free flow tolls and the payment of compensation to NTR from the toll revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I want to state, for the benefit of everybody here, that it was extraordinarily mischievous to suggest that we had to find, on the backs of motorists using the M50, an extra €1.5 billion or whatever to pay, first, for the upgrade and, second, whatever the cost to NTR would be in the future. That is based on the toll revenue as it exists today. There is no <i>imprimatur</i> from me to the NRA or anybody else to load huge increases on motorists using the M50. It will not happen and it is not required. Let us remove, therefore, the second myth from the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">My Department is also preparing proposals for amending legislation to strengthen the enforcement provisions in relation to the non-payment of a toll in a barrier-free environment. The introduction of this legislation at the earliest opportunity is a key priority of mine. I want to say, as it was raised by the Opposition, that this legislation, with I hope the assistance of Fine Gael and no doubt the Labour Party, will be facilitated through both Houses this year, well in advance of whether we will have a full free flow tolling system and the need for it in operation. There is no issue with regard to the legislation. Most of the work on it is complete and I will bring it before both Houses in due course. There will be no delay and no delay leading to the delivery of the new system.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The approach now being adopted reflects the reality of a binding legal contract between the NRA and NTR which gives the latter certain rights. Some commentators seem to consider that it is open to the Government or me, and the NRA to simply abrogate these rights and to unilaterally change the terms of a contract approved in principle by Government in 1984 and concluded in 1987. This is not possible. Neither was it possible when the NRA negotiated the supplemental agreement in 2000. The supplemental agreement for the second West Link bridge had to be negotiated within the provisions of the original 1987 agreement. In the circumstances, the approach being adopted by the NRA represents the best approach to resolving a very difficult problem and is one I fully support.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The M50 upgrade project was approved by An Bord Pleanála early last year. I believe we would all agree that the NRA has made very good progress in getting phase 1 to construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Before leaving the M50 issue, it should be noted that, as the chief executive of the NRA indicated to the Committee of Public Accounts, recently the planning permission granted for the upgrade requires that the NRA, in future years, continues to address the need to prevent future traffic growth from returning the upgraded M50 to unacceptable congestion conditions. He indicated in this regard that any contract entered into for barrier-free tolling arrangements must allow the NRA the flexibility to accommodate and satisfy these planning permission requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I want to deal with the issue of why that may take two years. From my perspective and that of the Government, the quicker we can make the move from a fixed tolling barrier system to a free flow system, the better. We must be honest in this House, however, because I will not pretend that we are in a position, as a sovereign Government, to ignore international procurement rules. To procure such a move in a public tendering process takes, on average, one year, moving at a good pace. If we get that done and have a free flow system up and running within another 11 months, it will be a record for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Let us not pretend that I or any Minister has, within our remit, permission to ignore all the procurement requirements that we are internationally obliged to adhere to in the context of a move from the barrier fixed system to a free tolling system. I would like to announce to the people at 9 a.m. tomorrow that we will have that in place by 3 p.m. in the afternoon. Those who pretend that this is in some way possible are grossly misleading people. Those are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Others are suggesting that we lift the barriers tomorrow morning and that there are various ways of doing it. Let them be honest and say that the taxpayer must pick up the bill for those who are not paying when the barriers are open.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">To take such an approach would be a very substantial penalty on all taxpayers, not just the users of the M50. If that is the position of the Fine Gael Party, it should say so. It should say that it wants tens of millions of euro taken away from health, education or wherever, but should stop being dishonest on this issue. What I have said is a clear unequivocal statement of the facts and I will debate the issues with anybody, on any platform or forum. People should not make up so-called urban myths and legends that I am supposed to have said over the past week or two. I find myself in the extraordinary position comparable to the Lyndon Johnson maxim, which has become currency to the effect that: "I know he did not say it, but I want to hear him deny it".</p>
          <p eId="para_549">It now appears that once the Labour Party says I said something, <i>ergo</i> I said it and it becomes a fact. The fact is that I did not. It is as simple as that. I have set out consistently this evening everything that has happened over the past two weeks. People were saying for the past two years that somebody should do something about the fixed toll plaza and NTR. I was the Minister who had the courage to do it. People should stop pretending that I have done something different to what everybody has been calling for over the last 12 months, because the facts clearly speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">As a Minister of the Government, or as anyone else, I cannot go to someone's house and tell the owner that I am taking it over and he or she should find something else to do. People have rights. We might not like them, but they have them and we have to respect them. Senator Dooley put that point very well. Whatever one's views of the original contract it added to the infrastructure of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">With hindsight, it is an awful contract and we have learned from it. Never again would or has a Government entered into such a contract. It is simply beyond——</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_555">It is important to be calm and to put the facts. All I ask Members to do, as Senator McDowell has done, is to debate the issue on the facts. Members may disagree with the policy decision I make. That is their choice, but they should debate it on the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I want to put on record the commitment of the Government, as part of its integrated approach to meeting transport needs, to the improvement of public transport in the greater Dublin area. A well-developed national road network and a free flowing upgraded M50 are obviously of major importance for growth and development in the Dublin area. Since 1997, we have concentrated transport investment on the construction of high-quality roads while also upgrading railway lines and services, building Luas and implementing other measures such as quality bus corridors. In the future, however, investment in public transport will be the main focus in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Transport 21 will result in the transformation of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area. This will be achieved through a major expansion of rail-based public transport infrastructure and by providing significantly increased bus capacity, combined with more quality bus corridors. Transport 21 will create a fully-integrated transport system for Dublin. It will be possible to get to most parts of the city with at most one change of train. Metro lines will provide rapid rail links to the city from Swords and Dublin Airport and an orbital route through the western suburbs to complement the M50 linking Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown to metro north at Ballymun.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The construction of an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station to the docklands will allow for the provision of DART services from Hazelhatch to Balbriggan and from Bray to Maynooth. Luas will be extended to the Dublin docklands, Lucan, Citywest, Liffey Junction, Cherrywood and Bray and the existing red and green lines will be linked. A major hub at St. Stephen's Green will integrate metro, commuter rail and light rail services in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">This increased investment in public transport, combined with the upgrade of the M50, the completion of the port tunnel and the upgrade of other national routes in the Dublin area, including the completion of the Naas Road and the Finglas-Ashbourne section of the N2, will ensure that the greater Dublin area has a high-quality integrated transport network capable of supporting its growth and development in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Concerns have been raised as regards the additional volumes of HGVs which will be using the M50 following the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel this summer. I met with key stakeholders this week including Dublin City Council, the NRA and the Dublin Port Company to ensure that these agencies develop a co-ordinated traffic management strategy for the opening of the port tunnel. My Department is working with all the parties to ensure that the Dublin Port tunnel is brought into operation in an efficient and effective manner and to ensure the smooth integration of traffic from the port tunnel with the Dublin road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Before concluding I want to refer briefly to the toll PPP roads programme. The national roads improvement programme, in line with the national development plan and more recently, Transport 21, provides for the procurement and construction of a number of major roads as toll PPP projects. The current position is that three projects — the second West Link bridge, the Dundalk western bypass and the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4 — have been completed. Work is under way on the Fermoy bypass and is due to start on the Waterford city bypass and phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">A number of other toll PPP projects — the N6, Galway-Ballinasloe, N7 and N8, Portlaoise-Cullahill, and the M50 PPP upgrade — are at earlier stages of procurement but I understand that the National Roads Authority expects these schemes to be in construction by early 2007. The Clonee-Kells section of the N3 is currently before the courts and the timeline for commencing that scheme will depend on the outcome of the hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The projects to be undertaken as toll PPPs have been selected by the NRA having regard to a number of principles. One of these key principles is that toll roads should be spread across the main national routes in order to create an equitable distribution of user charging on the newly-constructed network along with the benefits of the accelerated delivery of the new roads. Another fundamental underlying principle of the NRA PPP programme is that an alternative toll-free route be available for road users. Toll PPPs are only undertaken following rigorous assessment in line with Department of Finance requirements and guidelines and capital appraisal and where such assessment demonstrates that it offers value for money. The toll programme is making a significant contribution to the accelerated implementation of the national roads upgrade programme. It has also facilitated the more extensive use of private sector expertise in the design, construction and operation of facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">In summary, the toll road PPP programme will continue to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the national roads improvement programme. To conclude, it will be clear from the foregoing that a clear strategy is in place for the upgrade of the M50 on a phased basis between now and 2010. A central element of this is the installation of free flow tolling on the M50. Free flow tolling will be installed on the M50 in 2008 in parallel with the completion of phase 1 of the M50 upgrade. The M50 upgrade and free flow tolling, combined with the major investment provided for under Transport 21, will transform the transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area and ensure that citizens have a transport system, including a free flow M50, that meets their needs and provides a high level of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">That is what I call making decisions and delivering solutions.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">That is all the time he wants. I am willing to share more with him, but he says he only needs a minute. I may not take my full time because I appreciate that other Members wish to contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I wish the Minister well in what he is trying to do. I want him to do well because the country needs the changes he is proposing to work. He appears extremely confident that they will work. Time will tell because we have seen the mess we have right now coming for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">It is hard to have confidence this Government will deliver a project that will actually work because the M50 has been neglected for so many years. I live beside it and was a member of Fingal County Council. We have worked for many years at trying to address the problems of the M50 and surrounding areas. The delay in getting anything done underlines my lack of confidence in this Government's ability to deliver the changes that are necessary, such as road widening and upgrading at the interchanges. It was obvious for many years that such work was necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I realise that when the M50 was built we did not have funding to build the interchanges that were required, such as flyovers rather than roundabouts with traffic lights at the Red Cow and Blanchardstown intersections. At Fingal County Council, we spoke about that for many years. However, with the good economy that this country has now enjoyed for some years, faster progress should have been made to ensure that the work on the interchanges was carried out to deal with the problems on the M50, which are located not just at the toll bridge but at the access points to the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I also ask the Minister for Transport — I am sorry that he is now leaving the House — to consider the provision of an outer ring road. Not much has been said about that proposal in this debate, but we have been consistent over the years in pointing out the urgent need for such a road. When the M50 was built people thought that no other outer ring road would be needed, but we have known for many years that we need another ring road to go out as far as Celbridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, but I am not convinced that the Ministers will make the necessary changes to bring about the free flow of traffic on the M50. I suspect the problem will simply be moved from one area to another. If the Minister's plan is simply to remove toll barriers from one point of the M50, why does he not do that? His logic is lost on me, as I cannot see how that will result in the improvements that are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I recently visited San Francisco and travelled along the bridge that connects the airport to the city. I am not referring to the Oakland Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge but to another bridge that also runs for miles but whose name is difficult to remember. I noticed that, as on many other toll bridges around the world, incentives such as car pooling are promoted. We have never tried car pooling, which can be successful on roads as well as on toll bridges, so I ask the Minister to consider introducing such incentives. That bridge in San Francisco also has tolling in one direction, so drivers pay the toll going one direction but do not pay it on their way back. Again, pressure on the toll booths would be relieved if that kind of thing was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The delay in bringing about the necessary changes, which have been obvious to all concerned for a long time, should be a source of shame for the Government. Our motion highlights the hold-ups the delay has caused. The necessary changes were laid out in that great document A Platform for Change, but the plans have simply gathered dust or been reinvented in new forms such as Transport 21. No doubt we will see other such documents with the same proposals and projects year after year. We want to see implementation of the plans and some co-ordination among the bodies concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I thank Senator Terry for sharing her time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The final part of the Fine Gael motion highlights the unusual intensity of tolling that is proposed for the road between Galway and Dublin. Senator Kitt suggested that motorists could take alternative routes if they want to avoid the tolls, but the sad reality is that truck drivers who tried to avoid the single existing toll were told that the local authority would take them to court to force them to use the toll road. Therefore, I do not think the Senator's simplistic response is realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">If this country is aiming for a regional balance in development, imposing four tolls on people travelling, whether with goods or otherwise, from Galway to Dublin Airport or the port tunnel is simply punitive. The proposed tolls would be on Galway's outer ring road, at Cappataggle near Ballinasloe, at Kinnegad and finally on the M50. In no other place in Europe or elsewhere in the world would one find such an intensity of proposed toll routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">At a time when many Government agencies are trying to develop a regional balance between the west and the east of the country, people are still coming up with such daft ideas. I am sorry the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is no longer present, but that is the reality of the tolling situation that he, in conjunction with the NRA, has proposed. The proposal is not acceptable and must be changed, whatever consequences the Minister claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">I do not subscribe to the notion that the deal done with NTR in 1987 or prior to that was a good agreement. It is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight that the deal was a bad agreement, but even at the time it should have been fairly obvious that a period of 30 or 35 years for such an agreement was too long. The agreement should have included a reference to the internal rate of return so that the earlier termination of the contract would have been triggered in the event that the road turned out to be the cash cow that it has become. However, I do not believe that all the fingers should necessarily be pointed at the politicians. The people within the Department who were involved in the negotiations over a protracted period of time should have spotted the need for such a requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I welcome the initiative announced by the Minister, who is to be commended for taking the bull by the horns and terminating the intolerable situation of the M50 toll bridge. I also welcome the Minister's statement to the House that there will be only one tolling area when we move to barrier-free tolls. That statement flies in the face of many of the adverse comments the Opposition has made recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">On the general issue of tolls, I do not believe we should necessarily have tolls on bypasses. Whereas the toll on the M50 covers a large stretch of motorway that should be tolled, imposing tolls on bypasses such as those in Limerick and Waterford would not be the right direction to go. I have no difficulty with requiring people who use the excellent M1 going north to Dundalk to pay tolls, because no one could be anything other than glad to pay a toll for the opportunity of using that route rather than the previous road. Tolls should apply on motorways between our major centres of population.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">There are lessons from this on how we deal with public-private partnerships. I am not convinced that PPPs are the way forward for infrastructure. As an alternative I suggest we should establish semi-State companies which would be in charge of our motorways either prior or subsequent to their construction. If such companies were allowed to borrow, they would be able to secure funding with interest rates of around 3% or 4%. That would cost far less than the returns of between 10% and 12% per annum that are demanded by private consortiums. We need to consider such arrangements as an alternative, or even as a supplement, to the way in which we currently finance our roads programme.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_591">Before starting, I wish to make a point of order. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges recently considered situations such as this, where a Minister is allowed to continue over the time limit in a situation where other Members wish to contribute. It was the view of the CPP that the Chair should be entitled to allocate an additional number of minutes to the debate. I am not demanding that now but tonight is a clear example of why it is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank Senator Jim Walsh for sharing his time and compliment him on his approach to tolls, which appears to be that there should be a toll everywhere except in the south east. There is nothing wrong with that if one is trying to be elected there. However, he referred to a crucial issue. Much as we dislike what is on the M50, one cannot object to the point made by the Minister that a watertight contract has been signed. We can solve the other problems at one stage or another but there is no solution to that. We are stuck with the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Let us focus on that and how it came about. Tribunals have been running in this country for years, dealing with a couple of million euro here and there. This contract involves about €1 billion. Somebody signed it on behalf of the State and somebody signed it on behalf of the county council at a cost of €1 billion to the Irish people. That should be examined. Who negotiated it? I know who signed it but I will speak about them shortly. What contact was made? We should examine the tendering process and hear from the State's lawyers and other lawyers about the validity of that contract and how it came to be concluded at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The two people who signed it were the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, and George Redmond, the former Dublin assistant city and county manager, whose names arose in another context in recent times. That is worth examining. I would like to be reassured as to how that contract was concluded. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. I believe a wrong has been done on the Irish people. We can argue about traffic forever and we might resolve some of the problems, but we cannot resolve the contract. We are stitched into it so we should try to find out how it was concluded. Who is responsible for making the decisions on tendering, drawing up the contract, signing it and so forth?</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I believe I am more confused now than I was before the debate, although it was a good debate. Senator Jim Walsh spoke about PPPs. I have sought a debate on PPPs on numerous occasions in the Seanad. The PPPs are cash cows and they affect more than just the M50. There are also cash cows for schools, water supply, sewerage and other facilities. The House should debate public-private partnerships.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">It is a pity the Minister has left because he might have been able to clarify something in his speech. He said that free flow toll arrangements in 2008 would be a single point toll and that the toll will be set at a level equivalent to today's level, index linked, and will fund phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the cost of free flow tolls and the payment of compensation to NTR. The Minister went on to say that phase 2 is being procured by a public-private contract and involves the widening of the remaining three lanes and the upgrade of the other interchanges. On the one hand, therefore, the Minister says phase 2 will be a PPP but on the other hand, he says phase 2 will be paid for from the free flow tolling. What will the PPP for phase 2 involve? It is a pity the Minister is not here to explain it.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Government's amendment notes the decision of the NRA to terminate negotiations with NTR regarding the West Link, welcomes the comprehensive traffic study of the M50 which will be carried out by the NRA and notes that, following completion of this study, the NRA will complete specific proposals for free flow tolling of the M50. Why can the Government not implement the barrier-free toll system now? Why must this study be carried out? The Minister says it is a condition attached to the planning permission by Fingal County Council. However, it was not Fingal County Council that granted planning permission but An Bord Pleanála. I am more confused now than I was before the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Minister said nothing about the roundabouts on the M50. These are one of the biggest problems. I take the N4 route from Dublin and encounter serious problems. Sometimes it takes two hours to get to the M50 from the city centre but once one gets past the M50 there is no problem getting home.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I am paying too much tax and too many tolls. I pity the people who live in Kinnegad and Enfield who must pay €5 per day to go to work in Dublin. That is equivalent to an extra €109 per month on one's mortgage. If everybody's mortgage increased by €109 per month, there would be much talk about it. However, that is what these people must pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Senator Quinn referred to the polluter pays principle, that is, the more one uses, the more one pays. However, I presume he meant that the more one uses the road, the less one should pay, which is different. The people from Kinnegad and Enfield should be given a concession. That should also apply to people in Cork where tolls have been introduced. People who work in Galway city will also have to pay each day to go to work. There should be concessions for people who use the roads on a daily basis while people who use them on a weekly or monthly basis should pay the toll.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">There is nothing in the Minister's speech which leads me to believe that anything will be done in the next two to five years about the daily congestion on the M50. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your latitude regarding time. I regret that the Minister is not present to explain the public-private partnership for the second phase of the M50 upgrade given that he also says it will be paid for by the toll.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_171">
            <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
            <p eId="para_658">On 23 May 2005, a fatal bus crash occurred at Kentstown, near Navan, in which five school children tragically died when the bus toppled over. There was an understandable public outcry and the Government was obliged to react. In July 2005, €36.5 million was provided, and 130 buses were to be added to the school bus fleet. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, stated at the time that the school system would continue to maintain the highest standards. The bus tragedy in Meath focused attention on the necessity of providing seat belts.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">I was recently approached by a parent in the Galbally area, where approximately 30 children attend second level schools in Tipperary town. The school provides transport for approximately 30 pupils to Lisvernane school. The bus providing the service is an old Bus Éireann vehicle, which in recent times has been the subject of breakdowns due to mechanical defects. Following one of these breakdowns, one of the parents had to provide substitute transport at short notice. Regrettably, she was involved in an accident in which her car skidded and considerable damage was done to the vehicle.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The bus being used is not fitted with seat belts and it must travel on winding rural roads which in many parts are not satisfactory. Many of these old Bus Éireann buses are not suitable for the fitting of seat belts. The pupils using the bus are entitled to feel secure when being transported to school. The parents are rightfully concerned about their children and they need positive reassurance that a more modern school bus will be provided equipped with seat belts. I look forward to a positive response indicating that the Minister will ensure suitable and safe transport.</p>

          <speech by="#SiledeValera" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_172">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
            <p eId="para_661">I welcome this opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position regarding school transport services in the areas referred to by Senator Finucane. In general, Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport service on behalf of my Department, plans bus routes in such a way to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible students have a reasonable standard of service. At the same time, every effort is made to ensure that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The company places special emphasis on safety, and to this end has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. These procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are maintained and that all relevant regulations, as laid down by the Department of Transport, are complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">With regard to the case referred to by Senator Finucane, Bus Éireann has reported to my Department on the school bus that normally operates from the Galbally area to Tipperary town for second level students, and which also provides a service for primary school children attending Lisvernane national school. The bus was temporarily withdrawn from service by Bus Éireann last week to enable it to undergo its scheduled annual roadworthiness test, which it passed. This bus has a satisfactory operating record, and it has not broken down this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">While undergoing the test, the bus was replaced by a spare school bus which suffered a mechanical failure on two consecutive days. On both occasions a replacement bus was provided, but the timetable was inevitably delayed while the replacement bus made its way to the scene of the breakdown. A small number of children waited for the replacement bus to arrive, while others decided to make alternative arrangements rather than wait.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">While any mechanically-operated vehicle may be prone to breaking down for any number of reasons regardless of the standard of maintenance involved, it is more unusual for a bus to break down on consecutive days. Bus Éireann regrets the inconvenience caused to the families on this occasion and reassures them that arrangements are made to provide vehicle cover in the event of a breakdown.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">On the issue of safety belts, Bus Éireann has initiated a programme to retrofit its existing school bus fleet with safety belts in accordance with the timetable I announced in July 2005. The acquisition of additional buses to facilitate one-for-one seating arrangements is also in hand and all these buses will be fitted with safety belts. In general, safety belts are to be fitted on all services provided under the school transport scheme by the end of December 2006, and I understand the process is on target for completion within that timeframe.</p>

          <heading>County Boundaries.</heading>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_173">
            <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_667">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss what I believe to be a critical issue, not just for County Clare, but in its principle to many counties bordering expanding towns and cities. It would be welcome if the Government set about developing guidelines to ensure that some towns or counties do not get the wrong impression regarding what is acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">This issue relates to the application to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by Limerick City Council with a view to expanding into the territory of County Clare. The Minister of State is aware that one's county is an integral part of one's identity and sense of community. Any attempt to change a county boundary, taking people from one county to another, can have a profound impact on the lives and sense of identity and belonging to a particular area. I hope the Minister of State will give due consideration to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">The matter I am raising is a real concern in County Clare, particularly in south-east Clare, as it is the area under consideration, threat or attack, depending on one's view. I do not wish to overly dramatise this matter, but there is a threat to the identity of the people in this area. The area I come from and live in is not directly included in this application, but I feel for the people in the area affected. If it were to affect me, I would feel very aggrieved. I am making this strong demand of the Minister of State and his officials on behalf of the people affected by this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">I strongly object to Limerick City Council's intention to even consider County Clare as a suitable location in which to expand. The matter should get due consideration from the Minister of State given the importance of retaining the integrity of county boundaries for administrative reasons. From the perspective of the Electoral Commission, there is a clear policy in the protocols associated with boundary committees when they deal with constituencies, and an effort is made to protect existing boundaries. Surely Limerick city should look to its own county first to satisfy its expansion needs. I am not suggesting that the city should not look to expand to cater for the growth in its structure. I will not suggest how it goes about this process, but I contend it should look to its own county first.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">There is a territorial issue among the people of County Clare. While south-east Clare is the area under threat, many people throughout the county believe, from a territorial perspective, that Limerick city should take its eyes off the banner county and leave it as it is.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">County Clare is unique in terms of its existing boundary, because only a small section of the county is connected by land, along the border with County Galway. The county is very much an island, bound on the east by the River Shannon, on its southern shore by the Shannon Estuary and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean up to Galway Bay. Limerick city proposes to bridge the river to gain territory in County Clare. It is not acceptable for the reasons I have outlined and I hope the Department, while giving consideration to the proposal from Limerick city, will rule in favour of the desire of the vast majority of people in the affected area and throughout County Clare.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_174">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_673">I understand Senator Dooley's concern in raising this important issue for Limerick city, County Limerick and Clare County Council. Under the provisions of Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and the associated regulations a local authority may initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. A formal boundary alteration proposal by an authority must identify financial, organisational and other implications. It also involves the invitation of public submissions and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, received an application from Limerick City Council for a boundary extension in November 2005, which was made in accordance with Part V of the 1991 Act. The application affects Clare and Limerick County Council areas and, if implemented, would have significant financial and organisational implications for all of the affected authorities. Prior to making its application, Limerick City Council invited submissions from Limerick and Clare County Councils and also from the public. Each county council made a formal statement of response detailing the financial, administrative and other implications that the council wished to raise. In their statements of response, both county councils objected to Limerick City Council's proposal on numerous grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The Minister is currently considering the extensive and detailed assessment of the issues engaged in by the city council in developing its application. The Minister is also considering the analysis and perspectives of each of the county councils as set out in their respective statements of response. As the matter remains under consideration it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the application. However, I am in a position to briefly outline the Minister's options.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">It is open to the Minister to establish an independent boundary committee to examine the proposal and such a committee may make such recommendations as it considers necessary in the interests of effective and convenient local government. Any draft ministerial order following receipt of a report from a boundary committee would require a positive resolution by each House of the Oireachtas before coming into force. Alternatively, the Minister may regard the establishment of a boundary committee as inappropriate in the circumstances and may follow other courses of action in the interests of effective and appropriate local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">The Minister's decision will be made with the objective of supporting the local government system in the provision of modern, effective and relevant governance as a driver for the sustainable development of the Limerick-Shannon gateway area. I assure the House that the Minister is aware of the strength of local identity and the attachment many people in the areas concerned have to their historic boundaries. This attachment is shared by many of their elected representatives and is among the issues providing context for the Minister's deliberations. I understand the Minister intends to make his decision shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I thank the Minister of State for his response and take heart from his statement that the Minister recognises the strength of local identity and the attachment many people in the area have to their historic boundaries, and that this attachment is shared by many elected representatives and will be among the issues providing the context for his decision. If, however, the decision of the boundary committee is to encroach on County Clare then, if it comes before this House and if I am fortunate enough to be a Member of this House at the time, I will not support it under any circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">Members of Clare County Council have come out very strongly in favour of the retention of the boundary as it is, as has Ennis Town Council. I compliment the work of the members and officials of the local authority in putting up an effective defence against a predatory approach by what was once a friendly neighbour. I hope it will be so again when this issue is resolved, whether it be with the help of Solomon or someone else.</p>

            <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
            <p eId="para_680">The mental health services have been neglected and underfunded in recent years. Funding dropped from 11% of the total health budget in 1997 to 6.6% in 2003, but the WHO recommends that 14% of a country's health budget should be spent on such services. The provision of mental health services should be put on a par with the provision of general health services, both hospital and community services.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">Suicide is one of the severe potential consequences of mental illness and occurs with the greatest frequency among young males and older people. As chairperson of a mental health association in County Roscommon I believe we need more awareness and education on the subject. It is also necessary to get rid of the stigma of mental illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">The document, A Vision for Change, has a development plan for the mental health services but I am concerned that plan 1 for inpatient admissions proposes one bed for every 350,000 people. Aspects of the plan are very welcome, especially the ring-fencing of proceeds from property sales for mental health. I am being a little parochial but I believe local inpatient units such as the ones in Roscommon, Castlebar, Ballinasloe and Galway should be maintained. It is very difficult to come from Arigna in north County Roscommon to Galway, and it is impossible for someone from outside Belmullet to go to Galway. This is the Hanly report in another guise and I fear that mental health is once again being used in the context of that report. We must be vigilant and this is not the right way to go about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">Will the Minister of State indicate if community mental health teams will be put in place? Why is my county, Roscommon, to receive nothing from the fund of €18 million that has been allocated to the development of mental health services? The county needs funding to develop mental health teams. It needs a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker and specialist community nurses. We are very concerned that mental health services in County Roscommon will be left out and I appeal to the Minister to revisit the matter and allocate the money for those services. How can there be a service without inpatient beds or a fully-dedicated community mental health team?</p>
            <p eId="para_684">I appeal to the Minister of State to provide County Roscommon with local inpatient units. They have provided a wonderful service and will continue to do so if they are recognised and receive appropriate funding.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_685">I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">The recently published report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, outlines an exciting vision of the future for mental health services in Ireland and sets out a framework for action over the next seven to ten years. This report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since Planning for the Future was published in 1984 and has been accepted by the Government as the basis for the future development of mental health policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">A wide ranging and comprehensive public consultation process was undertaken in the development of this policy which gave a clear indication of the expertise that exists among professionals and service providers with regard to mental health issues. It also made clear the views of service users on the present state and future development of mental health services. Building on the findings of the consultation process, A Vision for Change recommends that specialist expertise in mental health services should be provided by community mental health teams, CMHTs. These are expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to serve the needs of service users across their lifespans. CMHTs should serve defined populations and age groups and operate from community-based mental health centres in specific sectors throughout mental health catchment areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The report also recommends that a programme of capital and non-capital investment in mental health services, adjusted in line with inflation, be implemented in a phased way over the next seven to ten years. The proposed new workforce will comprise more than 11,000 staff throughout the service. Allowing for the assimilation of all existing posts, the expert group has estimated that a total of 1,803 new posts across the services and non-capital investment of €151 million per annum in addition to existing funding will be required. The programme of investment has already begun with the allocation of an additional €25 million to the HSE for mental health services in the Estimates for 2006. Significant capital investment will also be required to provide new and replacement facilities for the mental health services. This has been estimated by the expert group to be of the order of €796 million, much of which could be realised from the value of existing hospitals and lands.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The County Roscommon mental health services have undergone significant changes over the past two decades. The move away from institutional to community care has brought the mental health services in County Roscommon closer to the service user and the switch from hospital based to individualised care has empowered users to take a more proactive role in their care and treatment. This has been complemented by the provision of care and treatment by multidisciplinary teams in partnership with other health care professionals and the voluntary agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">As the Senator will be aware, mental health services in County Roscommon are provided in a 30-bed integrated acute admission unit in Roscommon General Hospital and through community based services based at Áras Naomh Caolin and Knockroe House, Castlerea. A range of care and treatment is also provided in the day hospitals, day centres and outpatient clinics located throughout the three Roscommon sectors. The acute admission unit at Roscommon General Hospital opened in 1992 in response to Government policy on mental health as outlined in Planning for the Future. I am informed that this was a major turning point for County Roscommon's mental health services. As a result, St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, was closed and community-based mental health services were expanded, thus providing a large range of treatment options for service users in the community. These changes have been very much in line with the model of service provision now recommended by the expert group. The proposals in A Vision for Change will allow for further expansion in community services and specialised services for groups such as children, older people and those with particular needs. These changes will enhance the mental health services nationwide, including those in County Roscommon.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">I am aware that the voluntary sector in County Roscommon play vital roles in providing support to the service users and carers, reducing reliance on inpatient services and enabling people to become empowered and proactive in their recovery. This is complemented through giving service users a say in their care and treatment. The patient advocacy service provides a valuable independent voice on behalf of the patient and this concurs with the philosophy of client centred care espoused in A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The implementation of this policy will be a matter for the Health Service Executive in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The HSE has stated that the national mental health directorate within the executive will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. As Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health, I will be seeking the active support of all those who are involved in the mental health services so that together we can bring about the far reaching improvements recommended in A Vision for Change. I will shortly be appointing a group, as recommended in the report, to monitor the implementation of its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">A Vision for Change details a comprehensive model of mental health service provision for Ireland and describes a framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the entire community and providing accessible community based specialist services for people with mental illness. On that basis, the Senator can be assured that, in line with this policy, the level of mental health service provision throughout the country will be improved and enhanced in coming years.</p>
