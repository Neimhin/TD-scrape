#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Will the Taoiseach ask for the resignations of the Ministers for Defence and Transport in view of the shambles they have allowed to happen at Shannon? A major American airline has decided that one of our key airports is not safe. That airline has been providing jobs and security to the Shannon area for decades. That business has been radically cut because its planes are not safe in our hands.The prime responsibility of any Government is the safety of its citizens and visitors. Shannon is a key strategic airport, yet recent weeks have seen three breaches of security there, the daubing of a plane, two violent attacks and yesterday an RTE reporter wandering unhindered into a restricted area. The short-term implication of this is that people and the economy of Shannon will suffer. The long-term implication is that the world may well decide that no plane, freight or passenger, is safe at one of our major airports. This is nationally damaging and internationally humiliating.Jobs and the economy of Shannon have been damaged, American planes have been attacked, one of our main airports is unsafe and business that has been ours for decades has been lost. In view of this appalling incompetence and this outright shambles, will the Taoiseach ask for the resignations of the Ministers for Defence and Transport?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I am glad to note that that position has changed. The Government has always sought to strike a balance in the approach to security issues generally, not only in relation to Shannon Airport. That balance involves allowing legitimate and peaceful protest in a democracy while at the same time ensuring the protection of citizens and property. Since the attack in Shannon last September, the Government stepped up security there and at all times the Government will make decisions on security based on the best advice available.For a number of weeks there was what the Government considered a peaceful protest, which was watched by the security interests, both the Garda and Aer Rianta staff. They did not believe those people would move to violent actions, as they have. As soon as that happened, there was a review of security last week, which led to a step up in Garda activity. Following the event the other morning, we decided to take further action. The Garda Commissioner met the security chiefs and prompt action was taken by the Minister for Defence within a matter of 12 hours to bring in members of the Southern Command to take the necessary action to protect the planes. I spoke to the American special envoy, as did the Ministers. We have done everything we can to reassure people that the situation is secure.In reply to Deputy Kenny's question concerning one of the carriers making a statement, I endeavoured to check the position. I do not have evidence that this decision was linked to a security position. The carrier informed Aer Rianta that its next 17 flights would move to other locations for a period. It did not link that decision to security.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Taoiseach did not answer my question. An airport should be totally secure. Three weeks ago it became clear that Shannon would become a centre for protest and a target for protesters and-or terrorists, and the Government did nothing. There was the daubing of a plane and hammer attacks on planes and the Government did nothing. An RTE reporter wandered into a restricted area unhindered and the Government sent in the Army.The Taoiseach acts as if this is proper security in the national interest. Is it not perfectly obvious that it is a gross embarrassment, as outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a gross indictment of the competency of Ministers to allow a situation like this to arise? The reassurances the Taoiseach has given the House today have resulted, in part, in World Airlines withdrawing its business from Shannon, with which it has had business for decades. Does the Taoiseach not understand that leadership is about preventing failure and not bolting the door when another airline has pulled out?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I do not believe that Deputy Kenny is asking me to make decisions on a day by day or case by case basis on who assists the civil power. It is not a call that I make. I do not come in and decide in the morning that the Army should move into Shannon. That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. It is an aid to civil power.There was a belief we were dealing with a peaceful protest. As soon as violent actions took place – admittedly there was one on 4 September – the Government discussed the matter within a few hours of the event happening last Tuesday week. There was a meeting between the relevant Ministers. The Garda was asked to step up its security, which it did. There is an enormous perimeter in Shannon. When there was a further attack this week, the Garda Commissioner went to check the position and he asked for the Army to come in. We immediately acted and will continue to properly act to safeguard the security of planes and all people in Shannon.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I want to return to the deal between the congregations of religious and the State in respect of child abuse. The Taoiseach dodged the pertinent questions yesterday. He told me on 29 January that the information was in the Library, but most of the information is not there. It is generally accepted that the agreement is a bad one for the taxpayer and a good one for the religious congregations.The net point on which I want to focus is the indemnity which exposes the taxpayer to what the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, thought last night would be €500 million, but which the Progressive Democrats say is many times more than that figure.I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, last night. He said:Subsequent to the discussions at official level terminating in October 2001, I understand that the then Minister for Education and Science had further contact with the religious congregations as a result of which he informed Government on 30 January 2002 that he had reached agreement in principle on the amount of the contribution and on an indemnity.If the official discussions had terminated in October, who authorised the Minister for Education and Science to reopen discussions and conclude an indemnity? Was the then Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, at his desk when the agreement was signed off by Government in the dog days of the interregnum and two days before the new Government took office and the former Minister, Deputy Woods, went out of office? Was the Attorney General involved?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Deputy Rabbitte has asked me a question about the legal indemnity and I will answer it, but I wish to repeat what I stated yesterday. When I made the statement on behalf of the Government on 14 May 1999, I said that the Government's approach to this issue was to do the best for the victims in terms of redressing the wrong done to them. That was our purpose at all times and all the decisions we made along the way were to try to address an issue that had been ongoing for many decades and in which people had suffered abuse and received no compensation, redress or apology. That was what was involved.As regards the legal indemnity which Deputy Rabbitte queried, it was given to the congregations and covers only those cases that could be heard by the redress board but where the victim has opted instead for the court hearing. Cases must be commenced within six years of the date of the indemnity, which was June 2002. I put that date on the record yesterday. The Department of Education and Science is of the view that the overwhelming majority of cases will go to the redress board rather than the courts. In the event that a congregation decides to contest a court case, the case falls outside the indemnity and the costs will fall to be met in accordance with the court's decisions.The details of the legal indemnity took several months of discussions between lawyers representing the congregations and officials of the Department of Education and Science and of the Attorney General's Office. Discussions on this matter continued from early 2001 to October 2001. They broke down at that stage. As the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said last night, officials of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's Office were involved up to October 2001. The discussions then broke down.The former Minister, Deputy Woods, on behalf of the Cabinet, continued to try to get the discussions back on track. The meetings did not pick up again until March 2002 and, at that stage, the Department of Education and Science had its own legal representative working with Mr. Cox's office, which represented CORI, and the discussions continued.When it came to the final stage, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's Office were involved. Again it was done properly. It was driven by the then Minister for Education and Science because the institutions were his responsibility. We were trying to deal with enormous problems caused when the State asked religious institutions to care for children, a limited number of whom were, unfortunately, abused. That is why the State has an obligation to try to resolve the matter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The Taoiseach answered many questions I did not ask. We are all in favour of early awards to the victims and acknowledge that the religious institutions have finite resources.It is not true for the Taoiseach to say that discussions resumed in March 2002. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, told the House last night that the then Minister, Deputy Woods, informed Government on 30 January 2002 that he had reached agreement in principle on the amount of a contribution and on an indemnity. Why was the State so exposed?Did the memorandum that went to Government include the usual observation of Cabinet procedures, namely, advice from the Department of Finance and the Attorney General? Those are the net questions.I could ask where were the apostles of fiscal rectitude, the Ministers, Deputies Harney and McCreevy? How did they allow the State to be so exposed? Why was it not allocated on the basis of a percentage liability, whatever that may be, such as 50% each to the State and Church? Whatever would happen, the liability would be 50:50. Instead there is a cap on the liability of the religious congregations of about €40 million. For some reason land valued at about €40 million that had been transferred to the State way in advance of this and is not concerned with restitution has also been included. I do not understand why that was included. Was the Attorney General involved?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The memorandum brought to Government in June 2002 was a Government memorandum and was dealt with in the proper way. As I stated, these discussions continued for a long time. There was no rushed deal. The negotiations with CORI on the extent of the contribution had commenced at the end of 2000 and concluded in early 2002. The drafting of the legal documents took time.The view of the agreement with CORI was that a contribution had to be meaningful but should not be so high as to destabilise the congregations and the schools to which they still make a huge contribution. We were not operating on the basis that the congregation should pay everything and that we would bankrupt them.We should remember what happened. The State through the decades put pressure on these congregations to accept children into their care. As a result, the State has an obligation when things go wrong to try to assist them.The agreement with the congregations is €41 million in cash, €77 million in property transfers and €10 million in counselling. The State can refuse to accept any property offered and seek alternative purposes when it relates to land.

The current Minister has published the real list. Is the Taoiseach aware of the anger and sense of betrayal that is the reality for pupils, teachers, parents and boards of management who recognise that their schools' needs will not be addressed in the current year? The information as presented would give rise to concern for hundreds of schools that the programme for refurbishment or new building projects may not be completed in a short number of years.Many of these schools are in a deplorable state. What does the Taoiseach propose to say to teachers who try to teach pupils who are trying to learn in what I can only describe as damp, dilapidated, rat-infested and often overcrowded school conditions at both primary and post-primary level?As the Taoiseach knows, third level students will be staging a demonstration today in this city. Is it the Government's intention to reintroduce fees at third level and replace them with loans? Does the Taoiseach recognise that little improvement has taken place in the proportion of pupils attending third level colleges in this jurisdiction from the more deprived and less supported disadvantaged areas of this jurisdiction? What action does the Government now propose to take to address these very pressing issues?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	32	This year €343 million will be invested in primary and post-primary infrastructure. In his announcement last week, the Minister confirmed he would reallocate €20 million in funding from third level capital to the primary schools building programme in order to maintain the increased level of investment. There is a slight reduction in the capital programme this year compared to last year. However, it is about 170% more than five years ago. Almost €500 million will to into second and third level education.

The stages of development are: planning; development; design; tender; and construction. About a year ago I was asked to publish the stage of development at which all schemes were, so that those working hard in various committees throughout the country, those involved in fundraising and members of boards of management would have a clear picture of what we are doing. We have now done that and I am glad Deputy Ó Caoláin has given me the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Education and Science on this excellent work.

No amount of  word play will dismiss the fact that people have to teach in absolutely unacceptable conditions and our students, the children of this jurisdiction, are being forced to attend classes in most unsuitable circumstances. Unless we are prepared to invest in education for the future of our youth, which is one of the most important resources we have, we will reap a very sorry result. Will the Taoiseach reconsider the schools building programme in the current year? The Government is duty bound to increase the level of support and ensure that a greater number of schools are dealt with in the current year—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	40	On third level fees, the Minister has already made it clear that he is examining the position of access to education to try to make sure we can give a higher proportion of people, particularly from disadvantaged areas, the opportunity for third level education. For 2003, the education Estimate on the current side is €5.1 billion, which represents an increase of €290 million, 6% over the Estimate for last year. The capital programme will continue and the level of investment provided in the current Estimate will maintain existing services. We will not be able to build at the level at which we built in recent years – I have already given the figures.There is also increased provision for a number of other areas in education including resource teachers, special needs teachers, school retention initiatives generally and adult literacy. The Minister has clearly given priority to helping the less well off by putting money into education for the disadvantaged. Deputy Ó Caoláin will also be pleased to see that €508 million, which is a large amount of money, is being put into the capital programme. Over coming years we will continue to try to assist those schools that cannot be dealt with this year.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.The tenth progress report on the implementation of the Programmme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was compiled for the 31 October plenary meeting and is available in the Oireachtas Library, and a summary report on overall progress under the PPF, also available in the Oireachtas Library, both set out in considerable detail the substantial progress made during the lifetime of the PPF. Obviously, it would not be practicable for me to go through every item of the 154 page tenth progress report. However, as the final PPF progress report shows, the PPF has been comprehensively implemented.Regarding the national development plan, very good progress has been made in addressing the infrastructure deficits, both economic and social, that the plan was intended to tackle. In the context of negotiations on a PPF successor, the national development plan remains the crucial framework for the delivery of progress on the non-pay agenda. The Government has certainly made clear its full commitment to continued substantive roll-out of the plan over the period to 2006, while acknowledging that not all of the projects will be completed within the timescale originally given.The first item on the NESC's work programme for 2003 was completion of its three yearly strategic review of economic and social developments and policy, entitled An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise. The overview, conclusions and recommendations of that report were published in November 2002. The council is now finalising the text of the main report upon which those conclusions and recommendations were based, and I expect it will be published shortly. In the course of its work on that report, the council has decided to undertake a study of housing and land policy. This report will be an important item on the council's work programme for 2003.In the coming months, the council will determine the remainder of its work programme for 2003 and 2004. This will be done in co-operation with the other bodies in the National Economic and Social Development Office – the NESF and the NCPP.My Department chairs the National Implementation Body, which was established under the adjustments to the terms of the Programme for  Prosperity and Fairness in December 2000. This body, representing Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU meets as necessary to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF. The body considers, in particular, the potential implications of any ongoing disputes of special national importance. It also provides opportunities for informal discussion of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process, from the employer and trade union perspectives. In the framework being considered as part of a new national agreement, it is envisaged that the National Implementation Body will continue in existence.Together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, I met the employers and trade unions on Monday, 13 January following a briefing on the then state of play in the negotiations on a successor to the PPF. We presented the two sides with a set of proposals on six of the key issues under discussion – trade union representation, housing, inflation, statutory redundancy, the statutory minimum wage and pay, including implementation of the recommendations of the benchmarking body for the public service. We paid tribute to the efforts being made by all concerned to reach an agreement and urged the employers and trade unions to give favourable consideration to these proposals. We did so on the basis that a new national agreement represented the best way forward for all in the current climate, while acknowledging that we all faced difficult decisions in reaching an agreement. I noted that there was a significant overlap between the objectives of the Government, employers and trade unions and emphasised that the package we were putting forward represented the Government's best effort at charting a way through competing requirements. We looked forward to the early resumption of discussions with all of the social partners on the wider partnership agenda. Both sides responded warmly to the Government's intervention and undertook to consult their membership in the period ahead.In the case of the public service, payment of 75% of the benchmarking awards, and of the general round increases, is dependent on verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation agreed between the parties, maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement.A programme for modernisation of the public service agreed last week includes general provisions on modernisation and flexibility, as well as specific changes for the Civil Service, health, education and local government sectors. These provisions will enable the delivery of services in a manner, which more closely reflects the needs of the public. Performance verification groups, including independent members, will be established to assess progress in each sector.Following a final plenary meeting with the social partners on Saturday last the employer-business, trade union and community and voluntary pillars have indicated their willingness to positively consider a programme encompassing a comprehensive set of proposals on the wider non-pay and social inclusion issues, as presented, subject to some further drafting changes.The key national economic and development tasks to be accomplished relate to the following priorities agreed between the social partners: first, in macroeconomic policy, to consolidate the progress of recent years and achieve a medium-term growth rate capable of sustaining high levels of employment and facilitating the evolution of a more equal society – securing competitively low inflation, sustainable public finances and social, economic and environmental sustainability is central to achieving this objective; second, to build, maintain and share economic development and prosperity to ensure Ireland is provided with a level of physical and social infrastructure that is affordable and underpins economic development and participation in the fruits of that development by all sectors of our society; and third, to build a fair and inclusive society and ensure people have the resources and opportunities to live life with dignity and access to the quality public services that underpin life chances and experiences.The objective across these chapters taken together is to seek, in an integrated way, to reinforce Ireland's consistent policy framework approach and to implement and deliver policy outcomes developed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The new programme sets out a process of engagement with the social partners on a series of ten special initiatives to be undertaken during the period of the programme, covering areas such as housing and accommodation, insurance, migration, the long-term unemployed, vulnerable workers and those who have been made redundant, tackling educational disadvantage, waste management, care, alcohol and drug misuse, the inclusion of everyone in the information society and ending child poverty.I very much regret that farm organisations do not consider it possible to recommend the text, including a paper on agricultural matters, to their members. Their contribution to the social partnership process over the years has been significant. I understand they had expectations of specific commitments being made at this time in light of the difficult years most full-time farmers have experienced. The very difficult current position has not made possible agreement on these issues at this stage. However, I hope they will reconsider their position and see the merit of remaining within the framework of social partnership to advance their objectives.It is hoped a small number of outstanding issues in relation to both the workplace and wider non-pay issues will be finalised over the coming days so that the Government can be in a position to present to the House very shortly a composite  new agreement covering all the various strands. In the meantime, the text of the draft proposals on non-pay issues has been placed in the Library.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Media reports this morning indicate that a group of trade unions is preparing to campaign vigorously against the partnership agreement. Is the Taoiseach aware of these reports? Does he intend to meet the trade unions and individuals involved? Does he consider that such opposition poses a serious threat to the conclusion of a new agreement? In respect of the failure to improve public services in recent years despite the huge increase in expenditure, will the Taoiseach explain how, in the event of an agreement being reached, it will benefit the ordinary citizen in terms of increased efficiency in improved public services?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I am aware that, outside the main negotiating team from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and affiliated trade unions with which I have been negotiating, there are those who oppose the agreement. From my long experience of this process, I am aware that some unions and sections within unions traditionally oppose all national agreements and, regrettably, it appears they will take the same approach this time. We have done our utmost in these negotiations to deal with all the issues raised by various groups. A negotiating body represented the concerns of the union membership and we have endeavoured to deal with these in the detailed discussions held over the past three months. There are some outstanding issues on which I have to meet congress shortly. These are not necessarily the same issues on which some of the unions have concerns.Public services have improved substantially in recent years. However, I can understand the Deputy's question in the sense that it is argued that the enormous increase in resources invested in the public services has not led to the improvements in services it should have brought about. It is for this reason that we changed the system in this set of negotiations to one whereby benchmarking payments, if they are to be made, must be accompanied by a more stringent and accountable mechanism. The Department of Finance has been adamant – correctly – that this should be the case.A rather complex performance verification process, which is understood by all involved, has been introduced. This will mean independent groups with independent chairs will monitor the implementation of the modernisation initiatives to ensure the modernisation agreements are implemented before the payments are made. I am not saying the quality assurance groups which operated under the PPF were not good – they were – but the Department of Finance is insisting, due to the levels of resources we will pay under the benchmarking process, that the agreements on the very useful modernisation initiatives already agreed must be implemented.  The Department has spent several weeks negotiating with the verification groups to ensure these systems are implemented.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Is the Taoiseach satisfied the modernisation concept built into the process will bring about sufficient improvements to pay for the benchmarking process without resort to increased taxation? Who will have to pay? Does he accept that the general wording on commitments, modernisation and flexibility in respect of the public service will be sufficient to bring about real improvements and productivity increases in the public service? Will he tell the House how this will occur?The Taoiseach called on the farming community to reconsider the problems it has with the discussions and the agreement. At a recent meeting I held with the farming organisations, they made clear that they are very concerned about the European and global dimension to the problems they face. Will the Taoiseach invite them to meet him to go through the text of the document with which they were presented to help them reconsider their position? Farmers want to be part of progress, but have genuine concerns about career structures and farming incomes.The Taoiseach referred to a fair and inclusive society which should emerge from a national agreement. Yesterday evening I took the opportunity to walk some of the streets in the vicinity of this House. How can the Taoiseach stand over circumstances in which people are still sleeping in cardboard boxes and under blankets within 200 yards of the national Parliament after the five best economic years we ever had? Surely this is an utter indictment and demonstration of absolute incompetence on the part of the Minister or Ministers responsible for bringing about such a society?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Deputy asked three separate questions. Discussions on modernisation have been long and protracted. The reform and modernisation initiatives Departments want to achieve, not only in the Civil Service, but also in the health and local authority sectors, have been listed, documented and widely discussed. An amount of work was achieved under the PPF by the quality assurance groups because the 4% paid in October last year was linked directly to that. I do not want to be unreasonable about this. An enormous amount of progress was made under the PPF on many of these issues and substantial change was agreed to by the public service unions but an enormous list of items remained to be dealt with and for that reason the system is now changed. Performance verification groups will make sure that what is now agreed and documented can be implemented over the next three year period. That list is quite considerable. I hope it will lead to efficiencies which will help mainly the public services. It is designed to help the public, although it will cost money in terms of paying the public servants involved. I would be less than  honest if I said I believed the efficiencies will save money. What we are doing is paying for improved services, flexibility and modernisation and the State must ensure that we do not pay without getting the modernisation. That is what has been documented.The Department of Finance has spent months working on this and we have reached a satisfactory arrangement. Perhaps the State has not received everything it sought but it has a comprehensive agenda, some of which requires legislation. Most of it concerns straightforward issues that can be implemented by managers and I hope that happens. The part that requires legislation, which we will have to deal with in this House but which will be worthwhile, relates to the proposals agreed by the unions on implementing legislation to reform the recruitment process in the Civil Service. Some other areas will need further discussion with the trade unions but it is clear from the agreement that it is not a question of principle but the way it is implemented. I am very happy with that issue.On the question of the farmers, Deputy Kenny is right. The farmers raised three main areas. They had major concerns about the European Union dimension and what will happen in the mid-term review. It is not so much a case of what will happen in the mid-term review but what will happen into the future. I have said before on the record of this House and I will say it again that we will do Irish agriculture an enormous disservice if we do not take seriously what is happening in agriculture in Europe and what is likely to happen in the world trade round. We have probably protected ourselves fairly well up to 2011 but it will dramatically change thereafter and I continue to urge people not to wait until this issue becomes a crisis in the future. It is not that I intend to be around to implement what happens after 2011 but if we do not get it right and make the structural decisions now, it will be an enormous problem. I tried on three occasions in my political career to push forward this issue but I do not believe it will continue to be pushed forward. It is very important that it be dealt with.On the issue of the WTO, farmers have aired their views on that. On the third question about domestic issues, the farmers wanted specific financial commitments and wanted to reverse some issues which, quite frankly, we cannot do. However, if I can help I will. I do not want the farmers to be lost from the overall process. That is not necessary. I attended the IFA annual meeting last week and spent some considerable time talking to the leadership and to the general membership and I do not believe they want out of the process. I also heard what Mr. Pat O'Rourke of the ICMSA stated. They have all put an enormous effort into this area. They are very good attendees, not only on the agricultural issues but on all the other issues for which they sometimes do not get credit. They make a substantial input not only into the NESC formation but also on  issues to do with social inclusion. The knock-on effect is how that affects rural development. I do not want to see farmers out of the process. If I can assist in any way I will do so and, needless to say, I keep up with what is happening in the overall agreement and I talk to all the members on a regular, if not very formal, basis.On the third question raised by Deputy Kenny, I could go on at length about what is happening in the social inclusion area.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I accept that and I will be brief on the last question. To answer Deputy Kenny's question about the homeless initiative, the Cabinet committee on social exclusion had a long session on this issue last week. I am very familiar with the figures and the cases. We are trying very hard to drive the various agencies to work even closer together to deal with the problem. Most of the 140 people on the streets at night in this city are there by choice for one reason or another, and some of them are good reasons. I understand their concerns. I have read the reports. There are many other people in hostels, which is a bigger problem, but they have their own views about matters. If the organisations work even closer together, we can help them even more. We have a bigger problem in that there are 1,500 families who would be classified as homeless. They do not have the same problems as mentioned by the Deputy but they are homeless. Last week's meeting endeavoured to put together a plan to get people to work closer together this year. For once, this is not a budgetary issue although in terms of affordable housing it is an issue, but we will continue to work on that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Do the Taoiseach's remarks about the community and voluntary organisations saying there is nothing in the agreement for them mean that he will go ahead without them and exclude them? In regard to the affordable housing initiative and the provision of 10,000 houses, has the Government agreed to that? Will the Taoiseach indicate if 10,000 new houses will be produced as a result of this initiative and how soon will they be produced? I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said in the House yesterday that that will not be the case. I also draw his attention to the Minister's answer yesterday in which he said that the initiative will be designed not to impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. Who will build the 10,000 houses and who will pay for them? Will IBEC build them and will Fr.  Seán Healy pay for them? I do not understand this. How are we to build 10,000 houses without that having any impact on Government finances?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	52	There are two issues. I do not think the members of the community and voluntary pillar believe there is nothing in this agreement for them. Most of the groups are very happy with the ongoing progress although they want to see even more resources than what is in this year's Book of Estimates. That is not possible but in the various areas there is an understanding of what can be done and people accept the constraints, perhaps with some difficulty. We have outlined progress in over 40 or 50 areas that are affected by social exclusion.On the second issue, the position is that the social partners, both employers and trade unions, believe we should aim for a figure of 10,000 affordable houses. They believe we can achieve that in year one. The Government's position is that it does not believe we will get to the 10,000 figure but with local authority housing, houses that are funded under housing agencies and the affordable housing initiatives, we can get as high a figure as possible. In the discussions the Department does not believe that 10,000 new houses is possible but we should try to get to as high a figure as is possible. Separate to that, we are sitting down with the social partners to see what other initiatives we can implement to increase the supply of affordable housing.We can do much more in this area but the debate always comes back to the same issue, land. Both employers and unions have put forward views they want the Government to consider and I favour looking at those views regardless of whether they are feasible – it will become clear quickly enough whether we can implement them. To address Deputy Rabbitte's question, this would involve the State in one form or other, through the Housing Finance Agency or the other housing agencies, which come under the NDFA, involving itself directly in land purchase to have an impact on this problem. That is what is being suggested and, although I cannot be clear at this point whether it is possible, it is worthy of examination.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Will this come out of the existing housing provision? I cannot figure out from the Taoiseach's reply whether this has reality. Are these additional houses or are they the normal work of the building co-operatives, local authorities and housing agencies? Does this mean anything? It is important the Taoiseach clears this up. Who will build these houses and who will pay for them? Will the farmers provide the land so that Fr. Seán Healy can build them and IBEC can pay for them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Unfortunately not.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	55	We have clarified that. The Taoiseach should tell us because he knows how  important this issue is. There is not a Member of the House who is not besieged in his or her clinic by people with housing problems. There are 4,189 such people in my small council area but we only produced 40 new houses last year. I am very interested in this matter and it would be fantastic for my constituents if 10,000 net additional affordable houses were provided next year.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	56	A question, Deputy.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	57	If there is a written agreement will the Taoiseach tell me what is in it in terms of who will build these houses and who will pay for them? Is it not the case that some community organisations are not at all happy with the progress of the discussions? Will the Taoiseach proceed to an agreement without them if necessary?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	58	As Deputy Rabbitte said, this is an enormously important issue. Housing affects all the arguments about pay, directly and indirectly – I accept it is a big driving force in this area. For that reason we have been seeking ways with the social partners to maximise the highest possible amount of additional affordable housing. That is covered by the category of additional social housing, which obviously the State must pay for, or else, as in recent years, it is a case of putting more resources into community co-operative housing and social housing trusts. We must see if there are ways in which we can directly affect land values. That is what this comes down to.The problem all the time, even with affordable housing provided by builders, is that the land value is so excessive that costs are too high even with affordable housing. The only way to intervene is for the State to supply the land, although that is not new – it happened up to the late 1970s. The scheme involved was admittedly a low level one, with money given to the Housing Finance Agency, but the State intervened directly to finance the scheme. It is possible to do so again but we will have to work out the mechanisms involved with the social partners. If that scheme, which existed until 1979 or 1980, was revamped it would be a significant help in increasing the supply of affordable housing.The Minister for the Environment and Local Government said yesterday he does not believe we can get 10,000 houses, as the number is too high. We have not reached agreement on the figure but the construction industry is achieving very high levels of output year after year. I know from meetings with the CIF and the house builders that if we can give them affordable land they will be prepared to work on this, provided we have a satisfactory mechanism with which to do so.The Deputy's last question related to the community and voluntary pillar. We may not have agreed on every item but we have done our best to carry that pillar with us.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The Taoiseach said sustainability is central to the partnership process but it is ironic, therefore, that anomalies still exist and that there is no room for the environmental pillar. I want that on the record. My question is similar to Deputy Rabbitte's question and would be answered much more quickly if the Taoiseach said there was to be a constitutional amendment on the property issue.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	60	A question please, Deputy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	61	My question relates to the community platform, which has described the programme as a programme for austerity and vagueness. Will the Taoiseach respond to that criticism by being specific, for example, regarding the End Child Poverty Coalition's demand for a reduction in consistent poverty for children from 8% to 2% by 2007? Will the Taoiseach stand over that forecast? Will he review the failure by the Government to include refugees and asylum seekers in the process? Will he respond to criticism on that omission by the Irish Refugee Council?On farming, will the Taoiseach be honest enough to say that the REPS allocation from last year, which I understand was approximately €350 million, will now amount to €190 million and is therefore obviously not an increase? It has been portrayed as an increase because €173 million was all that was drawn down last year. He should be honest and fair enough to allocate the same amount of money and ensure the REPS money is drawn down by easing red tape rather than cutting funding.Will the Taoiseach appoint an Oireachtas committee to deal with homelessness? That issue keeps coming up because the Taoiseach says there is no problem and that people are on the streets because they want to be there. I ask the Taoiseach to help bring about agreement in the process by making someone accountable. It is an issue for many people.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	62	To take the Deputy's points in reverse order, I am not saying there is no problem with homelessness. Of course there is a problem and there will be as long as people are homeless. The majority of the homeless action plans, which were part of the homeless strategy I launched some years ago, have been completed, including those for the main urban areas. Work has been under way for a long time on implementing the measures in those plans and it is expected that the outstanding plans will be completed this year. The youth homeless strategy and the homelessness preventative strategies have been launched. However, there are still problems as some people still have difficulties.There is a problem with REPS as it is operated in a bureaucratic way but this is a draw-down issue. We get approximately 60% of the funds and the State then has to pay the matching funds. That is where the argument arises. In other years  the State's contribution exceeded the figures given. When we were able to contribute, the State's contribution was high and we put a lot of money into REPS. It is a problem now we are having a difficult year and this is the main issue we are discussing with farmers. There is a resource problem this year and I am not saying otherwise.Regarding social inclusion, I do not want to go through every programme but we have discussed many of them at length – NAPS, the child care programmes, benchmarking, the national drugs strategy, the Traveller strategy, the White Paper on Sport and Voluntary Activity, the legislative measures under discussion relating to the National Disability Authority, carer's benefit and the National Anti-Racism Campaign, which was mentioned by the Deputy. I hope we can reach agreement on that campaign in particular. We have discussed all these issues at length and have tried to reach a position where we can move on. For five or six years we were able to increase substantially the Estimates and it is difficult for people when we are in a period where that cannot be done. We are, however, funding the existing programmes.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The programmes under construction in 2000, 2001 and 2002 are still in place and we are paying them. People must take account of the financial position. This year in the Estimates we had to take into account likely growth of just over 2% and the likely income stream, and we had to moderate our spending plans. That is why we cannot endlessly increase these subheads by 20 or 30%.

The reality behind these statistics is that children are going to school badly clothed, ill fed and with few community resources. What is in this deal for them? Will the Taoiseach address the children whose case was so effectively highlighted yesterday by the End Child Poverty Coalition?Is it not true that this deal is about pay and very little else and, even on that score, many workers have every right to be concerned, given that they are being left behind in a faltering econ omy with growing inflation? Why should people believe the commitments in this agreement on education, housing and child poverty any more than they might believe the commitments in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, the programme for Government or, God help us, the national health strategy?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	69	In this country in the past five years there have been enormous increases in all these services, with huge resources being made available. There is much better accommodation, care and after-care across all the areas the Deputy mentioned, as he knows well. In all these areas the partnership programmes have assisted in the development of services and the establishment of new services. That is why we increased child benefit by so much and raised the number of child care workers in the State by a huge margin.I was happy to see the establishment of the coalition yesterday so that we can work together to improve and expand services into the future. That is what we have done under social partnership for the past 15 years and that is what we will continue to do in the time ahead.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance recently made a late night dash to join the employers and the trade unions for the wage negotiations. I was reminded of the three musketeers making a midnight dash to rescue the beleaguered king of France but I am sure it was more choreography and spin doctoring than anything else. Why should Irish workers have confidence in the wage deal the Taoiseach is trying to foist on them when the reality is that in the first 12 months of it, inflation will be almost double the proposed wage increases, with a resultant dramatic fall in living standards? Why should workers have confidence in the deal the Taoiseach is proposing when the whole process, fraudulently called partnership, has seen during its existence a huge shift to profits and rent and away from the amount going to workers in wages?Does the Taoiseach agree that the last instalment, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provided huge prosperity for the land speculator, the house developer and house builder but no fairness to the workers priced out of home because house prices have increased two and  threefold? Does he agree that there was great prosperity for the majority of landlords who rack-rented outrageously with absolutely no fairness for the workers dependent on private rented accommodation? What fairness has there been for workers since the introduction of the euro, with prices increased through the most outrageous profiteering in the service sector?The Taoiseach is proposing a continuation of that policy, with no provision to stop speculation, rack-renting by landlords or profiteering in prices while wanting to hold wages down, even going as far as threatening the right of workers to strike. This is a wage deal to hold wages down, covered up with a few meaningless additions.

Does the Taoiseach agree there is a serious democratic deficit in social partnership? The Taoiseach praised the fact that consumers would be involved in verification. Why were they not involved in influencing the modernisation programme? This year public pay will increase at ten times the rate of non-pay elements and next year there will be a similar situation. Does this not mean we have to raise taxes or find new ways of funding, or there will be the ridiculous situation where nursing homes will be closed down because the Government is unable to pay the capitation element to keep them going and people are left in hospital as a result? How will we pay these costs?

These young parents often face great difficulty in finding child care that is reasonably priced and at a good standard.

Social partnership may have had its downsides but the vast majority of assessments show it has  been enormously successful. There are 600,000 more people working.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	84	We must continue to move it on. Deputy Richard Bruton asked me a number of questions, but I will not have time to answer them all. The issue of services was his main concern. The actions taken in terms of the modernisation programme and the changes workers have made will improve efficiency. As I said in reply to Deputy Kenny's question, I am not saying we should save all the money. There is a cost, but that is only reasonable if we want better services. I do not know how we can do it any other way. If we want to make our services more efficient and modern, we must pay our workers for giving the flexibility which is necessary. As to whether we must consider increased taxation to improve our services, that will depend on what happens in the economy. As we found out in the better years, a low tax society which generates a lot of activity will help to create more revenue. It is not a good time in the world at present. It is time to retract a little.Deputy McManus mentioned child care. I agree with what she said that our society and workforce have gained from the huge changes in the past decade through the participation of women. It was for that reason we significantly increased child benefit. Deputy McManus will recall in the long discussions prior to that the arguments about whether we should introduce tax concessions or other arrangements. Some 90% of the groups involved wanted child benefit because it was the fairest way, although I thought the tax credit issue was a better way. It would have been cheaper from the State's point of view. However, there was no agreement by the organisations.As regards child care, approximately €430 million is being spent in the current national plan on additional facilities. It is important to continue to do that. We must build up a significant infrastructure of child care facilities within the community sector. That is happening, although perhaps not quickly enough. However, it is changing dramatically. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is giving out grants and the number of areas has increased dramatically in the past two years. We must continue to do that. I accept that young working couples face an enormous burden as a result of huge child care costs and the fact that they do not have access to community child care facilities. Money is provided in  the national plan for such facilities. Although they receive child benefit, they still face an enormous burden. That is why we must continue to increase child benefit because it is the fairest way to proceed. We must also put money into community infrastructure which is dramatically improving, even if it is not up to the number of places we currently need.

I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic I have received notices from Deputies Gormley and Morgan. I call on Deputy Gormley to state the matter.

We now see a situation where Irish soldiers are being asked to turn their guns on Irish people engaging in legitimate protest.

In the light of the ongoing issue in relation to the educational institutions and the redress board and having regard to the media attention given to paedophilia in society, can the Taoiseach give a credible reason for the fact that the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children has been shifted from a publication date of 2003 to 2004? Irrespective of whether there is such a credible explanation, will the Taoiseach indicate a more  precise publication date in 2004? This is a hugely important issue.

In page 11, line 31, after “Chapter 2” to insert the following:"which shall apply even if the proceeds of such unclaimed policies have already been transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund".This amendment deals with the situation whereby the Minister – I believe it refers to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs rather than the Minister for Finance – will be in a position to change the thresholds for which notification procedure is required in respect of  unclaimed life assurance policies before they go to the dormant accounts fund. In an earlier debate on the Bill, the Minister made it clear that it was his intention, over time, to reduce the €500 threshold on policies which would be notified to their owners before transfer to the unclaimed fund. It emerged from the Minister's statement that if we reduce that threshold to, say, €250 at some future date, all moneys already transferred to the fund at that stage would not have the new notification rules applied.In other words, the Minister is envisaging a situation where we will, in time, when we get used to this, drop the threshold and people who hold smaller assurance policies will get notification before their money goes off to the dormant accounts fund. People should not be disadvantaged because they happened, in the first tranche, to have their policy dealt with and the money sent off to the dormant accounts fund – they would never get a change to retrieve it. There would be information on the files of the life assurance companies about the identity of a certain policyholder but they would be under no obligation to notify that policyholder of the fact that this money was to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund. It is an undesirable position.The purpose of my amendment is to provide that in the event the Minister does reduce – he indicated on Report Stage he intends doing so – the threshold to €250 or whatever other figure, the life assurance companies would be obliged to retain a record of the identity of owners of funds which they have already passed to the dormant accounts fund and notify them that their policies have been transferred to that fund giving them the opportunity at that point to recover the money from the fund. We should take that extra degree of care. Here is a Bill where we are making arrangements to expropriate funds to the State which rightfully belong to someone else. Therefore, there is an obligation on the State to go the extra distance and to require the companies to go the extra distance.In anticipation of what the Minister might say, that the life assurance companies will have an interest in not seeing money flowing out to the dormant accounts fund, the life assurances companies will have some interest but they will not turn over every stone to ensure that where they have the identity of owners, if there is not a legal obligation, they will make the extra effort. We should make provision for this amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The life assurance companies should be put under an obligation when one considers the zeal with which they sell policies, often to people on relatively low incomes, particularly where, historically, people contributed small sums. Life assurance companies market their products extensively and use substantial advertising pressure to get people to invest in the funds. There is an onus on them, once people have  bought the funds, to retain full information and to make that information accessible, not only to the people who have taken out policies, but also to their families, etc., in the event of their death. While some companies are extremely helpful to people and their level of information in databases is good, other companies, which are dead keen to sell the stuff, are not so keen to facilitate policyholders or their families afterwards.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	157	There would be a considerable administrative burden on the assurance companies if they had to re-examine each policy to see how much it was then worth, to see if notification was required, with the ensuing adjustments of the companies' registers of unclaimed policies. There are difficulties with unit-linked and/or profits policies, and the fact that such policies can decrease as well as increase in value, so that one particular date, for the purpose of this legislation, needs to be set to establish the value of such policies.As we have been negotiating the proposals for this Bill for some time, the industry has been preparing for the onset of the new regime. Therefore, since publication of the Bill, the companies have already been attempting to identify policies valued at above €500 and, the IIF advises, probably been developing software to assist with this. To change the level of the threshold at this stage will cause the sector a not inconsiderable problem. For that reason, I do not intend to accept the Deputy's amendment.We should not underestimate the volume of work which has to be done in this particular area by the assurance companies in order to be able to comply with this legislation and to be able to transfer whatever funds should be transferred next year. There are hundreds of thousands of policies, many of which are small in value. The purpose of this legislation is to initiate the operation with a reasonable threshold and I considered €500 was a reasonable threshold in this regard.There are powers in the Dormant Accounts Act, and repeated in this Bill, which will allow the Minister to lower the thresholds for banks and assurance companies. If the Minister considered at a future date that he or she should lower the threshold, then the question of notification can be incorporated in those regulations. Therefore, at this stage I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment because I do not see a need to do so.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The Minister's reply is entirely unpersuasive. If we were intending to lower the threshold at a certain date in the future—
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	159	We might.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	160	If we might do so, we should put the assurance companies on notice at this stage. Rather than saying it is a matter for some  date in the future to decide how those lower thresholds will apply, we should make it clear to the assurance companies that wherever they can ascertain the identities of policyholders, they should retain that information because we would intend that that information would be used when the new lower threshold came into effect.The Minister's case is not at all persuasive. We are taking money off people under this legislation who will not be informed of the fact that they have unclaimed policies. A threshold of €500 is being set. Below that level, people will not be informed that their money is being transferred to the dormant accounts fund. The Minister is envisaging a situation where we will drop that threshold and policyholders should be informed if their policy is valued at, say, between €250 and €500. He should, therefore, signal to the assurance companies that he will expect them to retain all usable information regarding the identity of policyholders so that, in the future, they will get an opportunity to retrieve their money if it is not practical to do it at this stage. We should give the signal, which is applied here, that when the regulations change we will expect the life assurance companies to make arrangements that they are in a position to use all reasonable information available to them to identify those policyholders. I am unhappy with the €500 threshold in itself, but this at least ensures that when the Minister reduces the threshold, as I hope he will, it will have effect for everyone, not only those who come on stream at that stage.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	161	This year there will be four public notices informing people of this legislation and of course it is always open to the potential beneficiary, if in 20 years' time he or she comes across a policy, to make a successful claim.Furthermore, I would point out that the assurance companies are aware that the regulation may change at some future date and the threshold may be lowered. In this particular process, they will computerise as much of their records as possible and have all these on computer disk. This is a mammoth task because, as I said, for one assurance company alone there are hundreds of thousands of small policies.In case I gave the wrong impression that the Minister will consider lowering the threshold in the immediate future, whereas this will be a matter for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I would advise that he will not do it in the near future. I suggest it would be reasonable to wait and see how this legislation and the Dormant Accounts Act is working and give people a chance to comply with it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 12, line 2, after "policies" to insert "provided the regulation does not adversely affect the interest of the policy holder".This is an amendment to a section where the Minister is proposing to make regulations for the purpose of reducing the administrative and financial burdens of maintaining unclaimed policies. Therefore, this is a section where the Minister is envisaging simplifying procedures to relieve the insurance companies of some of the costs of administering the scheme.My amendment proposes that we should allow that to happen provided the regulation does not adversely affect the interest of the policyholder. We should stitch in clearly that if the Minister is envisaging regulations that would reduce administrative burdens on the life assurance companies, it should only be where the Minister has taken into account the interests of the policyholder. We should make such provision and I am confident the Minister will accept the amendment. If the Minister envisages making regulations that would reduce administrative burdens on the life insurance companies, it should be only where the Minister has taken into account the interests of the policyholder. We should make such provision and I am confident the Minister will accept the amendment.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Section 7(3) sets out the purposes for which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs may make regulations in relation to the various matters set out in section 7, such as the form of the notice procedure to customers or the information to be stored on an institution's register of unclaimed policies. This section, which closely mirrors what is set down in the Dormant Accounts Act, has been drafted to allow the Minister scope for adjustment of these provisions once the scheme is well within the public mindset and, in particular, once the backlog of long unclaimed policies has been cleared.The dormant scheme is an initiative which has not been implemented elsewhere in the European Union where we might have been able to build on the experience of our European colleagues. The reason for section 7 is to ensure that once the scheme is operational and has become familiar to both the public and the institutions and, in particular, the backlog of long unclaimed policies has been cleared, adjustments can be made in the interests of all concerned, both the policyholder and the insurance undertaking. Once the scheme is operational, for example, it may come to light that more details should be kept on the register of unclaimed policies in order to assist all parties in making and processing a claim. The section closely mirrors what has already been enacted in the Dormant Accounts Act.Section 7(3)(a) and (c) specifically provides that the Minister will make regulations for the purposes of consumer protection and to facilitate policyholders who are attempting to identify moneys to which they may be entitled. For that reason it should be clear that the ethos of the provision is primarily to assist the policyholder  rather than the insurance undertakings. As the section is designed mainly to protect the policyholder, it does not need the provision proposed by Deputy Bruton.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	164	We know a great deal about an ethos not delivering in practice. One need only look at the scandals in every walk of life to see that many institutions appeal to an ethos but ultimately do not deliver. We are making law, not generalised statements about ethos. We should provide, as proposed in my amendment, that if the Minister is introducing regulations to reduce the financial burden on the life assurance company, it should be done only if the regulation does not adversely affect the interests of the policyholder. There is no down side to accepting the amendment. If the Minister is correct about the ethos he intends to pursue when producing the regulations, it cannot conceivably damage it. It simply gives legal underpinning to a provision that otherwise would rely on the Minister's interpretation of "ethos". I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument. The amendment should be made.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 12, lines 5 to 7, to delete all words from and including ", except" in line 5 down to and including "policy," in line 7.This section deals with the notice provisions. It provides that before the money in a policy with a life insurance company is sent to the dormant accounts fund, the policyholder should be notified. However, if a policyholder happens to have had more than one policy, he or she would only be notified in respect of one of the policies. Somebody, for example, might have a trivial amount in a policy of which he or she does not keep track or which is under a different address. If he or she has been notified of that policy at the wrong address and fails to respond, the insurance company is under no further obligation to give a notice in respect of subsequent policies in the name of that policyholder and can legitimately send them to the dormant accounts fund as unclaimed policies.There is no justification for this. Each policy should be treated as a separate entity and the insurance company should make the same effort, in respect of each policy, to submit a written notice to the owner of the policy. This is good legislation to protect the interests of policyholders whose money would otherwise be expropriated by the State.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Section 12 provides that certain policyholders will be personally notified once, in the year that their policies are deemed unclaimed, of the existence of the policies, the fact that the moneys to be claimed under them are due to be transferred to the dormant fund and of the steps  that can be taken to reactivate the policies. It should not be forgotten that before and possibly since these policies became inactive the insurance undertakings were attempting to make contact with the policyholders to no avail. Although the Bill only requires a single notification, it is in the industry's interest to pull out all the stops to contact these policyholders, given that they will lose the underlying funds if no contact is made yet will still have to administer the policy.The Bill does not prevent an undertaking from making further attempts to contact policyholders whose moneys have been transferred. To compel the insurance undertakings to go beyond what is reasonable in this regard will inherently involve extra costs to the insurance industry which will inevitably be passed on to the customer. Section 9 provides that the public notifications regarding the scheme will take place every year, so the public will have sufficient notice of what might be happening to its money. This year alone there will be no less than four separate public notices placed by the institutions.I do not believe the full burden of keeping track of a life policy should lie with an insurance undertaking. It is for the individual to take responsibility for his or her own financial matters. This legislation and the Dormant Accounts Act are intended to assist individuals in this regard, not to remove all responsibility from them. In any case, the policyholder will not lose out if his or her money is transferred to the fund as the right to reclaim it is statutorily guaranteed.In addition, a number of statutory and contractual provisions already exist which oblige insurance undertakings to keep regular contact with their customers. These include the Life Insurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001 which provide that during the term of the policy the undertaking must inform the policyholder of, for example, any changes in the policy conditions. Under the Insurance Act 2000, which applies to all policies other than industrial grants policies issued after February 2001 and which have a surrender value, the insurance undertaking must provide the policyholder with an annual written statement in relation to the policy. Under the terms of this Act, the policyholder must complete a declaration form that he or she has been given this information. Under the Insurance Act 1936, when an insurance company or undertaking is merged, the new entity must inform existing policyholders of the details of the merger. Under contract, as some policies require index linked contributions, undertakings must notify policyholders annually of what the contributions will be.As I said on Committee Stage, since the dormant scheme came on line last March, less than 12 months ago, its success at reuniting people with their money has been significant. This is evidenced by the number and value of the reactivated policies that have taken place since last March and shown by figures my Department has received from industry representatives. A total of  approximately €400 million lay dormant at the end of March last year. This relates to the credit institutions, not the insurance institutions. By the end of last December, approximately €150 million of that figure had been reactivated. We can deem the scheme a resounding success in meeting its primary goal, to reunite people with their money. This is being done via the notification procedures in the 2001 Act which are identical in nature to what is proposed in this Bill. For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Minister is simply reading the brief from the Department in response to the amendments. He is not seriously thinking about the issue. If these life insurance companies are obliged to notify people annually about relatively trivial issues relating to their policies, why does he balk at the idea of notifying them when they will lose that money altogether by transferring it to the unclaimed fund?

We are providing legislation solely for situations where policies are not claimed. The Minister for Finance is saying that although insurance companies are notifying these policyholders on an annual basis about all sorts of things, he will not allow them to individually notify policyholders about when they are going to have this money transferred into a dormant account. That is what the Minister is saying and it makes no sense.

In many cases the reason they will go unclaimed is because of a change of address or a change in circumstances of the individual concerned. Only one address will be notified, yet the individual may have moved on to somewhere else or will not receive the notice because some other eventuality has occurred. This amendment does not, as the Minister is suggesting, put an unreasonable burden—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I suggest that the Minister accept this amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	177	That is not what the amendment says. This amendment provides that if there is more than one policy in the name of the same person, then the insurance company is obliged to make a separate notification in respect of each policy it proposes to transfer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Bill provides for precisely the opposite – if an insurance company discovers one insurance policy in January, notifies the person and nothing happens, and then, in December, discovers a much larger policy in the name of the same person, it has no obligation to notify the individual. That does not make sense to me. No unreasonable burden is being imposed by accepting this amendment, and we may as well get the legislation right. As the Minister is suggesting, the industry must feel it to be in its interests to continue to hold these funds unclaimed.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 12, to delete lines 35 to 37.The purpose of this amendment is to remove the lower limit that the Minister has already discussed to some extent. I do not see any reason the insurance companies should not be obliged to contact people with insurance polices of a value below the limit already discussed. There are often people in possession of multiple policies, insurance companies may have changed hands and policies may have been amalgamated.The Minister asked a few minutes ago whether insurance companies should be expected to search the by-roads of Meath, or wherever, in search of policyholders. The reality is that this affects many elderly people who have accumulated and paid for insurance policies over a very long period of time. They were used to the insurance man calling to their homes and keeping the information about their policies. It is unfair to impose this limit. People who hold lesser amounts should be informed by the insurance companies and have an opportunity to reclaim their policies.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	182	There is a need to make some change in this respect, and one or other of the amendments should be accepted. The Minister  suggested during the Committee Stage debate that the acceptance of such amendments would lead to a 500% increase in administration costs. However, he did not provide any clear indication of what the costs of administration were or of the advantages the insurance companies had enjoyed over many years of having the use of funds from these unclaimed policies. I would not shed many tears for insurance companies that are going to have some additional burdens. The Bill only provides for the requirement to issue a written notice. It is a letter held on a word processor that must be despatched to any name and address on their files.This amendment does not impose significant obligations. It merely imposes the minimum obligation anyone would expect – that if an insurance company has been collecting money from people for many years, as Deputy Burton points out, it would make the minimum effort of writing to them to inform them since the policy has been unclaimed, the money will now go to the dormant accounts. We should not be dictated to exclusively by unsubstantiated concerns on the part of insurance companies. I have not seen any of the documentation that the Minister adverted to on Committee Stage indicating that this would bring the house of cards down. If the insurance companies make all reasonable efforts to identify the owner of a policy, and the Minister says they are already doing so, then we are merely asking them to issue a written notice to those owners.If they cannot identify the owner then there is nothing they can do about it, and the Bill is not asking them to do something they are unable to do. We are not asking them to go searching the highways and by-ways of the country, merely to check their own records, which they should have retained. We ought to accept either the lower threshold or the entire removal of the threshold, as Deputy Burton has suggested.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I support the amendment to remove the threshold in its entirety, although I acknowledge that lowering the threshold would also be beneficial. We need more information regarding the windfall nature of the benefits the insurance companies have already derived from accounts of this nature. I do not accept the Minister's argument about the administrative costs and difficulties of contacting people who hold such low value accounts.The Bill should go further in ensuring that insurance companies make every effort to contact such account holders. The Bill provides that such contact can be made through written letters to last known addresses. With the advances in information technology in recent years, we should put an even greater onus on an industry that itself depends so much on information technology to use every available means of communication to ensure that information is passed on to the account holders concerned. I hope the Minister will consider removing the threshold, which is an artificial barrier, which would ultimately release  more funds into the dormant accounts fund for better distribution.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I wish to make a general point on this legislation and the Dormant Accounts Act 2001. At the moment, the balance of advantage lies with the insurer or the bank because the money is in some person's account and the bank has use of it in its reserves to generate profits. It is in the interests of the insurance company, therefore, to make sure to contact Mr. A at his last known address because if it does not, and unless Mr. A says he is alive and wants to do more business with it or take the money out now, the money will leave the bank account of the insurance company and be transferred to the State and into the dormant accounts fund. It will then be dispersed for the purposes laid out in the Act.In both the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and this Bill, it is in the insurance companies' own financial interests to try to make contact with customers holding accounts above the threshold of €500. If they do not make contact and there are no customer-initiated transactions, the money will go to the Exchequer and they will no longer have use of it. People like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and me felt for a number of years that this was not correct and that something should be done about it. As Minister for Finance I am lucky enough to be in a position to do something about it. All kinds of advice about the difficulties of doing this were visited upon previous holders of this office. I recognise there are difficulties but we have done this for banking institutions in the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and now we are doing it for life assurance policies. It may be possible to do this in other areas in years to come.It is in the interests of life assurance companies to find an account holder at the last known address. Judging by the tenor of some of the amendments this is not widely understood. Banks are currently making an all-out effort to contact customers because 31 March is the cut-off date. Less than one year ago €400 million was held in accounts that had been dormant for 15 years and two months ago that had decreased to €250 million because the banks are reactivating accounts. To my personal knowledge, branches have gone to extraordinary lengths to contact their customers in recent weeks because they know if they do not make contact the money will go to the Exchequer. I imagine the same rules will apply with insurance companies.Regarding the amendments, balance must be reached between the aim of reuniting people with their moneys and not placing an undue administrative burden on the financial institutions, especially as any costs involved will be passed on to the consumer. The full burden of keeping track of the policy should not lie solely with the company; the individual must also take some responsibility.Most low value policies have not yet been computerised and this has involved a lengthy manual trawl of paper records as insurance companies have to notify these customers. Considering the value of such policies this does not seem to be worthwhile at this time. This is particularly true in the case of old industrial branch policies sold by door-to-door salespersons – I was married when a policy taken out by my mother many years previously matured and it came to the princely sum of £92 10/-. Bearing in mind the case of such policies there are often very few contact details available. The policies were often sold door-to-door by salespersons who knew their customers personally and did not see the need to record accurate contact details. In these incidences, we accept the proposal to remove the threshold altogether at this time. It would be impossible for the insurance undertakings to comply with the law.Section 9(7) of the Bill provides that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs can alter the €500 threshold. Undertakings have already tried to contact these customers to no avail. In any case it is in their interests to pull out all the stops in doing this so as not to lose the underlying funds while still having to maintain the policies.As my Department has been drafting this Bill for some time, the industry has been preparing for the onset of a new regime. Since publication of the Bill, companies have been trying to identify policies valued above €500 and the Irish Insurance Federation advises that it has been developing new software to assist with this. To remove or change the threshold at this point will cause not inconsiderable problems for the sector. There is nothing to prevent the undertakings from writing to all customers or doing so more than once – this is likely to happen in any case. Since the dormant scheme came on stream last March, the number and value of accounts reactivated has been significant.Four advertisements will be placed this year regarding this new scheme, two by the insurance industry, one on behalf of the banks and building societies and one on behalf of An Post. This should bring the scheme into the public consciousness.The right to reclaim is statutorily guaranteed. Once records relating to these low-valued policies are finally computerised and the backlog of unclaimed policies has been cleared, it might then be appropriate to lower or remove the threshold. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

Given that we agree many of the people affected by this will be elderly, why not use the offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to inform people? Almost all these people will now be in receipt of a State pension and a notice given through the Department of Social and Family Affairs would  be more effective. While many people collect their pensions at post offices quite a high proportion now use banks. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a good record of public information campaigns and it should be the primary conduit of the information campaign.I do not know the format the advertisement in the newspapers will take, but bank notices are generally dreary, threatening and often off-putting to elderly people. If the Minister is not prepared to lower the threshold I hope he will give consideration to this. Community resource centres and old people's centres could also air the notice. This type of information campaign would be more effective in this instance.

In page 12, line 43, to delete "fails" and substitute "has been unable".My eminent legal advisers inform me that the word "fails" is ambiguous and the substitution of "has been unable" is a clearer terminology from a legal standpoint.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Section 9(1)(c) provides that where an insurance undertaking has taken all reasonable steps to notify the policyholder and fails to do so, the undertaking need not personally notify such a policyholder of the existence of an unclaimed policy. The proposal is to provide that the undertaking need not contact such a policyholder, where it has tried previously to do so but has been unable to do so, rather than having failed to do so.As this section was drafted in order to provide a defence for the undertakings in circumstances where they have taken all reasonable steps, as provided under section 9(1)(c), the Office of the Attorney General advises that the onus of proof is greater where the requirement is that the undertaking was unable to make contact rather than that it failed to do so. To be “unable” could imply lack of ability to make contact, which should not be the case and which would – I am sure the Deputy would agree – be indefensible. However, to “fail” to make contact implies that all that could reasonably be done was done, such that no fault then lies with the undertaking.Further, to provide that the undertaking has taken reasonable steps but has been unable to  make contact infers that the undertaking should have been given more time, that is, that the reasonable steps were inadequate. This would leave us with something of a conflict in this section.I could guess the eminent legal advice the Deputy has taken, and I have often concurred with it on previous occasions and accepted amendments, but we have the opposite advice on this area from the Attorney General. This is an issue between lawyers.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 13, line 11, after "policies" to insert "and the number of such policies".This section deals with the advertisement that is to be placed in the newspapers informing potential holders of unclaimed policies that the assurance company concerned has such policies. This amendment proposes that such an advertisement would not only state that an assurance company holds unclaimed insurance policies but that it would also indicate the number of such policies as of the date of the notice, given that the number would change over time.The inclusion of this amendment would make a difference in terms of public information in that it would alert the public to the potential for them to claim back money on unclaimed policies. If the public were notified that, for example, Irish Life had 1,000 unclaimed policies, that would have a much greater impact and would probably generate news coverage about the issue rather than a bland newspaper advertisement, as Deputy Burton suggested, to the effect that an assurance company had unclaimed policies. The provision of such additional information, which would be available to the companies would considerably enhance public awareness of this issue. At least the companies could at the time of the notice give their best shot in terms of their information on the number of unclaimed policies held. Acceptance of this amendment would be helpful and worthwhile.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	192	It will probably not be possible for the undertakings to publish, on the day of the public notice, the number of unclaimed policies they each hold. Section 9(1) does not require the companies to have identified all their unclaimed policies by that date. Rather, each company will merely have to establish by that date – usually the first weekday in October each year – that it holds at least one such policy. Therefore, if we  amend the section, as proposed, it is likely that the companies could not comply with the law as it would then stand.As I pointed out earlier in relation to the banks, they published a notice some months ago, but they are still reactivating policies and checking their records. However, they were aware that an account holder had at least one bank account that met the relevant criteria. The same rule will apply to the assurance companies. The companies will establish that they have policyholders who comply with the relevant criteria and fall into this category. They will then be required to publish a notice in that regard every year in October. However, the companies will have from October until the following March to work out the total number of their unclaimed policies as at 31 March and the proceeds from such policies will then be transferred to the dormant accounts fund.If any such policy meets the criteria of section 9(1), that is, whereby the proceeds of the policy are below €500, is deemed "non-correspondence", or the undertaking has previously tried unsuccessfully to make contact with that policyholder, then the undertaking must place a public notice in relation to those policies.Experience gained from application of the scheme to the credit institutions would indicate that the identification process will go on for some months after the date of the public notice, at least initially, when the backlog of policies is to be cleared. This is even more likely to be the case for the insurance undertakings, given the disparate nature of life policies, and the two different periods of dormancy that apply in this case, five or 15 years.In any case I can see no value in publishing this information. It is enough that the public will be made aware that all or most life assurance undertakings in the State hold unclaimed policies. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I could easily meet the substance of the Minister's objection by changing the amendment to include the words "and the number of such policies known to the company on the date of the notice". If the Minister requires further clarification, the additional words "and compliance with this provision will not constitute a breach of any other section of the Bill" could be included. If the Minister is concerned about the legal obstacles to the acceptance of this amendment, it would be easy for his draftsman to overcome them. On the other hand, if the Minister is simply determined to deny the publication of information that would alert the public about this issue and give them a much more meaningful understanding about what is happening, that is a different matter. If that is the case, then the Minister will object to any formulation of this amendment.The public have a right to know about this issue. Their money is being transferred; it is not  someone else's money. To include the additional information proposed would, contrary to what the Minister said, greatly enhance public interest in this issue. If members of the public were aware that, for example, Irish Life had 1,000 unclaimed policies, Royal Liver had 3,000 and another assurance company had 5,000, that, in itself, would be a news story. Such information would generate a good deal of news coverage and many more people would probably come forward to identify whether any of those policies belonged to them. The inclusion of this amendment would enhance the significance of the public information notice.

I anticipate that when an assurance company issues a notification, the press will inquire about the number of policies it envisages will be unclaimed. In any event, after the first year, the number for that year will be obvious and people will have an idea about the number of unclaimed policies held in the following year. The big rush will happen in year one, as happened in the case of the banks. Dealing with these accounts will be a major operation. I do not believe there is any advantage in including the Deputy's amendment.If an assurance company were to indicate in the first week of October that it had 1,000 unclaimed policies and it transpired that it had 50,000, it could be accused of having provided incorrect information. The staff in these companies might decide to work day and night from October to March to comply with the legislation. I do not believe there is any advantage in including this amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 13, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"(f) that–(i) a Central Database of the name and date of birth of unclaimed policies is jointly operated by the NTMA and institutions covered by this Act so that a member of the public can check the possibility that they are the holder of an unclaimed policy or have an entitlement to its proceeds, by furnishing photographic evidence of identity and the Birth Certificate of the possible policy holder, and(ii) the operator of the Central Database, on receipt of this evidence, will arrange for  any institution holding an unclaimed policy in the name to make contact with persons in respect of whom there is prima facie evidence that they are entitled to the proceeds of an unclaimed policy, in order to establish if he or she is entitled to any monies;”.This is the group of amendments I would most like to see the Minister accept. Their acceptance would provide the public with a much simpler way of identifying whether they own an unclaimed policy, the proceeds from which will be transferred and, equally, it would provide the same provision, as applied in the case of dormant bank accounts, which no doubt are much more numerous.In these amendments, effectively, I am proposing a central database. One of the problems with maintaining a central database relates to restrictions from the Data Protection Office and under the Data Protection Act. In these amendments I have tried to devise a procedure which would overcome the restrictions under the Data Protection Act. I contacted the Data Protection Commissioner to ascertain whether he thought that such a procedure might be acceptable. While he obviously only gave me a general opinion, I was encouraged to learn he thought there was potential in this procedure.I propose that a central database would be maintained and jointly funded by the NTMA, which will be the beneficiary of the unclaimed policies and by the institutions who are currently the beneficiaries of the unclaimed policies. The central database would only contain the name and date of birth of people who held unclaimed policies. In other words, it would not contain any confidential information relating to the account or to the address. It would provide a fairly simple contact point, which a person could check in terms of his or her name and date of birth. If on presenting them the central database discovered that it had a person on its records with the same details, it would communicate that to the financial institution concerned which would then contact the person who had presented himself or herself, not the other way around. That person would not be given the opportunity to scan all the data held by the central database and none of the rules covering this area would be breached. Only a person's name and date of birth would be used and for the purpose for which he or she gave them originally, namely, for life insurance policies.This information would not be open to others, such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána and credit collectors, from whom the Data Protection Act rightly protects people. It would provide a two stage process that would be 100% insulated from misuse by people who would seek to use the information for purposes other than those for which it was intended. It would greatly enhance the scope for identifying unclaimed accounts. My understanding is that a person can go to the Irish Bankers Federation which will contact banks in an effort to help. It is a tedious procedure because it must contact every  bank to see if a person of the name concerned holds an account there.My proposal is for a central database. Its support, which has resulted in a number of amendments, would be by insurance companies placing the name and date of birth of all customers on their registers which would then be transferred to the central database.This is an attempt to deal with the problem that the Minister admitted on Committee Stage was a genuine concern. He showed some sympathy for the approach at that stage. I am disappointed, given the weight of the drafting abilities behind him, he does not have a corresponding amendment rejigging the terms of this provision. It is a worthwhile amendment.There would be some expense and it should be carried jointly by the National Treasury Management Agency, the ultimate beneficiary of the dormant accounts money, and the institutions concerned because there would be some additional expense in maintaining such a central database.As we move forward, we will undoubtedly examine other areas. People have drawn my attention to the fact that, for example, where a company is taken over by another, the shares of dissenting shareholders who do not accept the transfer of ownership are held by the original company. This is another type of unclaimed account which I hope the Minister will, in time, pursue. Similarly, uncashed dividend cheques return to the central fund of a company and this presents another legitimate case. If we are to go this road, and I am sure the Minister sees these other opportunities coming up the track, we should make the effort to put in place a central database of this nature that could retain the information in a way that would be sufficiently encrypted so as not to be abused. I hope the Minister looks sympathetically on these amendments.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I support the amendment and the need for a central database not only for accounts that result from unclaimed life assurance policies and previous bank account legislation but also for the other examples Deputy Richard Bruton mentioned. Some difficulties will probably remain to be overcome, for example, whether the person named on the accounts is the beneficial holder of such accounts depending on when they were opened.The amendment could be nuanced further by adopting the availability of information technology. For example, it is not necessary for a person to walk into an office with a birth certificate or other identification documents to access such a database. With the Internet, the companies concerned could supply someone making an inquiry with a password or PIN that would make such information unique to that person.The need for a database is something that has been well argued and will become more obvious as more sources of finances that are absorbed into the general profitability of financial institutions are revealed in society and the economy at large.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on this series of amendments.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I am not completely convinced of the merits of establishing another database with the NTMA. The agency will soon be doing everything in the country at the rate at which we offer it responsibility. There is a simple way of doing this, namely, from a certain date, requiring people to give their personal public service number, what used to be called the RSI or tax number. That can also be firewalled against being given to inappropriate authorities for other purposes. The essential core of the personal public service number is a person's name and date of birth. It is a unique identification that is given to children as they are born. We have an embryonic database and we need rules by which it can be utilised in future without the need to establish another one. It would require stringent privacy rules associated with its use for these purposes. It would be a simple way of addressing the matter. Deputy Richard Bruton is to be congratulated for the detailed amendment he has tabled and the thought he has put into it.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The proposal for a central database, accessible by members of the public, to the extent where they can check if there is a dormant asset in their name, is one we have examined before and holds a great deal of merit. The Deputy's proposal is that such a database would be operated jointly by the NTMA and the institutions. Where the controller of the database received reasonable evidence of a claim to the proceeds of a dormant account or unclaimed life policy, arrangements would be made for the relevant institution to contact the claimant and pursue the matter.I agree with the Deputy that if such a database was properly constructed and managed, this might further assist members of the public in tracing dormant moneys. I am aware that a number of commercial organisations are interested in assisting with such a database. However, although I think these organisations may be underestimating the legal complexities and obstacles to be surmounted if we are to proceed with this proposal, I am on record as stating that I am in favour of this but do not consider it can be countenanced for the Bill because it requires detailed further analysis from both a legal and commercial viewpoint as well as the agreement and assistance of industry.A number of issues must be considered, not least of which is the legal and constitutional right to privacy enjoyed by all. In this regard, the issues to be considered are the institutions' duty of confidentiality to their customers, the issue of non-correspondence accounts and policies, the Data Protection Act 1988 and the constitutional right to privacy.Analysis of these issues might show that these obstacles are not insurmountable as, for example,  many of the account holders or policyholders could be dead, such that the right of the heirs to private property takes priority. However, before we examine the legalities of this, it might be prudent to obtain more details from the institutions on the profile of likely claimants.The Deputy suggested that the database would not be generally accessible but rather serve as the first port of call in establishing a claim. I will come back to this point later but would suggest that measures are already in place that provide this service.The second major consideration is the commercial viability of establishing and maintaining such a database. In this regard, I would not foresee a role for the NTMA. At no stage will the agency be given personal details of accounts or policyholders. It will merely have details of totals transferred from any given institution and the number of accounts or policies involved. Therefore, it is to be assumed that the database would be administered by the institutions themselves.It would then have to be established who would exercise overall control, who would resource it, how often it would be updated to take account of reactivations and where it would be located. Strict controls would have to be put in place to ensure that only legitimate access to the data could be obtained. Naturally, this raises the issue of liability for unwarranted access to or dissemination of information as well as the potential for fraud. In the model proposed, the institutions would have to accept this liability. This could only be done by agreement.There is a question concerning the cost involved and how that cost would be shared as between the institutions. I am advised by industry that the costs, which include set-up and software development as well as staffing implications as regards handling and monitoring of data, are likely to be considerable, given the number of assets we are dealing with, and may outweigh any added value that a central database might bring, particularly as its main use will probably only be in the first year of operation. It also should not be forgotten that any costs are likely to be passed on to the customer.We should also not lose sight of the fact that the institutions already have systems in place which can be used by the public to trace lost or forgotten assets. Anyone with a potential claim can request an institution to examine the evidence of such. In particular, where there is uncertainty as to where the asset may be, the representative organisations – the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Irish Mortgage Council – will pass on information they receive to their member institutions with a view to tracing the moneys. Sections 14(5) of the Dormant Accounts Act and 12(5)(b) of the current Bill provide that where adequate proof is adduced of a claim, the claimant will be entitled to examine an institution's register of unclaimed policies or register of dormant accounts, as the  case may be, in so far as that account or policy is concerned. To a large extent, this already meets the purpose for a central database.Nevertheless, I do not want to give the impression that I see no value in this proposal. As I have stated, this was looked at previously when the 2001 Act was being drafted, but was not pursued as so much else had to be achieved in that legislation. I have asked my officials to examine this matter further and discuss the pros and cons of the proposal with industry and the Office of the Attorney General. As I see it, centralising large volumes of personal data would not only have to be legally permissible, but also cost effective and user-friendly to warrant pursuing the exercise. The Deputy and this House can rest assured that this is still under consideration as a near-term objective.I would not see a role for me as Minister for Finance in promulgating that legislation. The matter would have to be considered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, having had advice from the Attorney General. I see no objections to outside bodies doing this type of work if they can overcome the possible legal and constitutional difficulties regarding the matters to which I have referred. If any outside bodies believe there is a profit to be made from this, I would so encourage them, in so far as they can get over difficulties that may arise regarding the other matters.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I thank my colleagues for their support on this amendment. I did not intend that this measure would be given to the NTMA either in terms of access to names and addresses or to operate it. I simply believed it should share the cost, as it is the major beneficiary of this legislation. I chose the date of birth rather than the PPS number because many of these policies would not have had PPS numbers on them, whereas it is much more likely that the date of birth would have been recorded on some of these unclaimed policies. Over time that certainly will change. I did not know there were commercial organisations interested in this, nor do I carry the can for any such organisations.I welcome the Minister's willingness to look at this further and I recognise that my amendments could not simply be accepted without further analysis. However, the issue of fraud, mentioned by the Minister, would not be a major concern. They would add significant extra value over the Minister's proposal that people could go to an insurance company and inspect a register in respect of their accounts. In practice people will not go to several different sources of that nature. The merit of the central database is that they would only have to go to one place. This is an important element that should be considered.I am disappointed the Minister is saying the onus to do this is elsewhere. It will not happen without some legislative authority. I cannot see companies surrendering even minimal information to a commercial operator if it is not pro vided for in law. If we are to go further down the road of ensuring that unclaimed moneys that are currently to the benefit of commercial operations should revert to the State, we need to consider such legislation. If the Minister returns to the House, as I hope he will, to deal with unclaimed moneys in commercial companies as a result of dividends or other share transactions, he should by then have the appropriate legislation from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This would mean that when we consider the next tranche of funds, we will not have to accept general sympathy towards the idea without being in a position to work out the legal complexities.I thank the Minister for his general support and hope he will be able to inject some urgency into his colleagues to investigate how this can be done in practice.

In page 14, line 42, after "section" to insert "or amounts claimed by the Minister where the Minister is of the opinion that the undertaking's estimate under subsection (2) is inadequate”.The purpose of this amendment is to provide a mechanism whereby the company's estimate of a value can be challenged by the Minister. In the legislation the onus rests with the company.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Section 10(2) of the Bill currently provides that where the net encashment value of a policy cannot be accurately determined by an insurance undertaking, an estimate of its value will be determined and that amount transferred to the dormant accounts fund. This section was drafted to take account of the old industrial branch policies, where often, due to inadequate details, it is only possible to establish what is owed on presentation by the policyholder of the policy document. The section closely reflects the provision in the Dormant Accounts Act for "petty balances".The Deputy proposes that my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, be given authority to claim further amounts in respect of those policies from the undertakings where the Minister is of the opinion that an undertaking has underestimated what it should have transferred to the fund. I do not propose to accept this amendment for a number of reasons. During discussions with the insurance industry when drafting the Bill, it became clear that it would be impossible to accurately determine how much is owed under these policies. Therefore, I do not think that the Minister would be able to carry out any more accurate assessment of the amount owed.Most of the undertakings tend to establish an industrial branch fund into which the undertaking  transfers an amount it estimates to be its liabilities in respect of these policies. The undertakings have indicated that they intend transferring most of the proceeds of these funds to the dormant accounts fund. The amount to be transferred will be based on a calculation carried out by the undertaking's actuary as most of the records relating to such policies are non-computerised. However, as these industrial branch funds generally hold moneys from a large number of very low value policies, it is preferable, from a cost-effective administrative point of view, that the undertakings themselves rather than the NTMA deal with reclaims on those moneys. We can take it that the dormant fund will take most of the moneys from these IB funds rendering this amendment unnecessary and, most probably, unworkable.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 18, line 22, after "undertaking" to insert "in accord with regulations set by the Minister".This amendment deals with the section that allows insurance companies to levy charges or make deductions in respect of policies before they hand moneys over to the dormant accounts fund. Perhaps my amendment is redundant in that I felt their ability to levy charges and make deductions should be limited by regulations set by the Minister. On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that the word "may" in that section is interpreted to mean that they can only do so in accord with the terms of the actual policies concerned. If that interpretation is accurate, my amendment is redundant. However, it is an interpretation that an innocent word such as "may" did not immediately convey to me. Will the Minister confirm that the use of the word "may" means the provision will be restricted to the application of legitimate charges that were notified to the policyholder in advance at the time he or she undertook the policy? This would ensure there are no surprises or additional charging.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Section 15(3)(a) provides that the moneys to be paid to a valid claimant are to be net of any charges or deductions that may be made by the insurance undertaking, in other words, charges that comply with the normal and legal practice of insurance undertakings in these circumstances. As such, these charges and reductions take account of taxes and administrative charges which the undertakings are legally entitled or obliged to recoup from the proceeds of a policy that has been encashed. It would be inappropriate for my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to  make regulations related to such taxes or administrative charges in that they would raise either the revenue matters or the contractual relationship between the insurance undertaking and its client. In any case, the basis for these charges is the policy contract. I have long held that the dormant accounts scheme should interfere as little as possible with the rights of customers and that is what this Bill and the previous legislation have tried to adhere to. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18224	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I move amendment No. 15:
In page 19, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"(f) the making of all reasonable efforts to identify unclaimed policies.”.The amendment tries to address the obligations of the insurance companies to make all reasonable efforts to identify unclaimed policies. This section, which provides for a certificate of compliance, provides that an undertaking must show compliance in a number of matters, including the publication of notices, transferring money to the fund and keeping a register.The one matter which the Bill does not appear to provide for is the most basic test of all, namely, that the undertakings have made all reasonable efforts to identify the owners of accounts or policies. If such efforts are not made, the policy will never be deemed unclaimed and, as such, the proceeds will never be transferred to the fund. We need to make legal provision in the Bill for this to happen. Perhaps that is already the case and I failed to spot it. We need to put the onus on companies that they cannot fail, perhaps through benign neglect, to make reasonable efforts to identify whether a policy is unclaimed.We have defined what an unclaimed policy is, namely, one to which certain things have not happened over a defined period, but we do not appear to have taken the extra step – the Minister is free to correct me if I am wrong on this – of establishing a legal obligation to identify and notify such unclaimed policies. If the companies in question do not make the effort to deem accounts or policies unclaimed, the dormant accounts fund will not benefit from them and the undertakings will be in a position to avoid losing the money in the accounts from their reserves. As the Minister correctly pointed out, it is in their interests to keep such moneys. Perhaps the amendment is redundant. I ask the Minister to comment.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The certificate of compliance completed by each institution and subject to the dormant accounts scheme will be signed off by a duly authorised officer of the institution in question and will state that the register of unclaimed policies has been properly maintained. The register will contain a great deal of detail about an  institution's unclaimed policies, for example, the number of each category of policy, the dates on which notices were sent to policyholders, the dates on which the policies were deemed unclaimed and all details regarding claims from the dormant fund in respect of any given policy. Therefore, it seems clear that if the register is properly maintained and this is certified by the authorised officer, all reasonable efforts must have been made by the institution which identifies its unclaimed policies.In any case, the amendment would negate the need for section 8(3) which provides that it is an offence for an undertaking not to give notice to the holder of an unclaimed policy. This section already ensures that the undertakings must take all reasonable steps to identify unclaimed policies. To attempt to go beyond the provisions in the section would result in a disparity between the provisions for the credit institutions and those for the insurance undertakings. It would also infer a need for the institutions to take steps beyond the stringent measures already set down in the Bill and would provide no added value, given that what one institution considers reasonable may not be considered reasonable by another. For these reasons, it is unlikely that the proposal is workable or warranted and I do not propose to accept it.

In page 25, line 2, after "privilege" to insert "or would otherwise be privileged against disclosure in legal proceedings".This amendment addresses the notion of privilege which is confined in the Bill to legal privilege. There may be exceptional circumstances in which other forms of privilege would arise, for example, executive privilege in relation to State secrets. Confining it to legal privilege is not reasonable.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Section 24 of the Bill provides that undertakings will be indemnified for information they disclose to inspectors if that disclosure is done in good faith. This section has been included in order that confidential information about policyholders can be given to inspectors where it is needed to check the valid and efficient operation by that undertaking of the dormant scheme. However, section 24(2) provides that an undertaking can refuse to disclose any document containing information which is based on professional legal privilege, in other words, information related to advice from a solicitor or barrister.This is a standard provision and, as such, there are many statutory precedents for this type of clause, for example, section 68 of the Stock Exchange Act 1995. However, to attempt to provide for privilege beyond advice given by a solicitor or barrister is only ever done on foot of statute for a specific reason. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 is an example of an Act in which privilege is given to certain officials in relation to their functions under the Act. For example, officials cannot be compelled to produce documents which are the private papers of a representative of the European Parliament.Under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, privilege is given to witnesses appearing before committees of the Houses in relation to documents they are compelled to produce before the committee. What is suggested in the amendment has no precedent in statute and, having checked with the Office of the Attorney General, it would be unacceptable from a legal point of view. I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 28, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"(b) Eighty per cent of the moneys in the investment and disbursements account shall be directly applied in areas specified by the Central Statistics Office as being economically disadvantaged.”.This is my sole amendment to the Bill. It seeks to address the original legislation, the Dormant Accounts Act, which the Bill before us seeks to amend through its Second Schedule. The Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill, as the legislation is now called, has received universal acceptance in the House in terms of the principle it advances. The debate has been about the technicalities as to how the policies can best be delivered into the dormant accounts fund. My amendment seeks to specify the way much of the money in the fund can be spent. I ask the Minister to give consideration to it.The original Dormant Accounts Act is general about the areas in which the money can be spent. There is a need to be more specific as to how the money can be spent. I acknowledge that, at the very least, there is now a political remove that might not have existed in terms of previous funds that were set up and from which public funds were subsequently allocated. I am thinking particularly of the misuse of the original national lottery funds in terms of the way the money was spent and who decided on the areas in which it was spent. I want special consideration given to the potential that exists in the dormant accounts fund to be a tool of wealth redistribution, which is something the Minister and his colleague on the Government bench might not be prepared to accept. That potential could be realised by the Minister accepting this amendment.The model I suggest is that the Government has already made use of the Central Statistics Office to define the areas in terms of economic disadvantage when it announced the RAPID and the CLÁR programmes, neither of which has been successful because specified funds did not exist for those programmes. They were merely a front-loading of national development plan projects. If there is a specified sum of money in the dormant accounts fund, 80% of that could be allocated to communities already defined by an agency of the State as being economically disadvantaged. The Dáil would be sending out a clear message through this legislation about how public money can be used in a more beneficial way. I ask the Minister to improve this legislation, which I admit has the widespread acceptance of everybody in this House, by accepting this amendment.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Central Statistics Office has published regional accounts detailing county incomes and retail GDP, the most recent being for the years 1995-99. The public accounts tabulate estimates of disposable income, a total income per person per region such as the NUTS II, Border, midland and western, and southern and eastern regions, and by county, as well as GVA at basic prices per person by region. As such, the Central Statistics Office may indicate in a regional accounts publication the regions which fall above or below the State average disposable income but it does not specify areas as being economically advantaged or disadvantaged.In any case, I do not propose to accept this amendment for various reasons, the primary among them being that what is already in the Dormant Accounts Act at section 41 ensures that those with the greatest needs will benefit most from disbursals from dormant funds. It was never intended that geographical areas of disadvantage,  even if they could be identified and agreed on, should benefit but rather that individuals suffering disadvantage of a social, economic, educational or physical nature should gain from the scheme. I am sure the Deputy will agree that many people who are disadvantaged live outside areas that might be considered such. There can be no doubt that from the sums involved, we are better off targeting the individual via programmes and projects rather than the area. Would the Deputy's proposal, if accepted, be any more effective than the application of the criteria already in the Act? I do not think so and for those reasons, I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.

Attempts are now being made to suppress this type of protest and we should all be on our guard to ensure this legislation does not wipe out all the civil liberties many of us have fought for over many years. Let us always remind ourselves of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.I have major concerns about section 13(1) dealing with the convention and the physical protection of nuclear materials. As far as I am concerned, any state with nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction is a terrorist threat. They should all be hauled before the United Nations and the UN inspectors. They should be disarmed and the people involved in protests against these states should be commended and supported by all of us. Under no circumstances should these type of protests be linked to terrorist activities and I challenge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, to stop using the spin in the debate on the recent media coverage. That old style of politics will not fool the people.The recent Shannon experience should be a wake-up call for all of us in terms of elements in the media and in political circles. It is a bit rich  for Ministers and TDs to make a big deal about the protests at Shannon when they appear to have no problem supporting the proposed bombing of civilians. Five hundred thousand people could be massacred in the next month and that is nothing short of terrorism as far as many people are concerned.Situations like that should always be mentioned in debates on legislation on terrorism. The events of 11 September, the terrible suffering of the victims' families and the subsequent deaths of civilians in Afghanistan should never be forgotten. We should not be selective in our condemnation and our opposition to the slaughter of civilians and many of us will be on the side of those with a particular interest in human rights. Compassion, justice and fair play must be at the top of the political agenda when dealing with this type of legislation.I welcome the Minister's comments yesterday on the anti-apartheid and anti-globalisation movements that changing society or campaigning on issues is not against the law. I hope the Minister will accept amendments that will ensure public safety and protection of human rights.

Assassinations, hijackings and bombings continue to be the staple methods. A growing percentage of terrorist attacks are designed to kill as many people as possible. In the 1990s, a terrorist incident was almost 20% more likely to result in death or injury than an incident two decades ago. Thwarted attacks in 1993 against New York City infrastructure, including plans to bomb the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, were also intended to cause mass casualties. In 1995 in the Philippines, authorities uncovered a terrorist plot to bring down 11 US airliners in Asia.Exploiting modern technology, these groups have used video cameras for training and reconnaissance purposes and computers to store files. Terror groups have adapted quickly to the Internet, exploiting it as a tool to further their legitimacy. Use of this medium continues to evolve. In the future, it may offer a more lucrative target for disruption and destruction as the global economy becomes increasingly dependent on web commerce.It is incumbent on Governments to take steps to protect society from criminal acts and to bring those responsible to justice in the course of proceedings which meet with international standards of fairness. However, measures taken in the immediate aftermath of atrocities are rarely effective in achieving this goal. History has shown that they frequently lead to miscarriages of justice and undermine public confidence in the rule of law.The multi-million dollar blank cheque given to the Bush administration to combat terrorism in the wake of the 11 September catastrophe raises questions about how wisely such resources will be spent. The fight against terrorism has been the justification for a series of controversial policies  including tougher immigration laws, high military and intelligence budgets, restrictions on civil liberties and sanctions against rogue states.The offence of money laundering has gained considerable ground over the past 20 years and this Bill seeks to address the problems in so far as it relates to terrorist funds. Money laundering is an insidious crime at best.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The Government's strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which were prioritised by the strategy. Driver formation has in accordance with the strategy been assisted in a number of ways, including the introduction of a driver theory test for applicants for first provisional licences, support for the voluntary driving instructor register and support for an initiative by the Irish Motorcyclists' Action Group to establish a network of motorcycle instructors throughout the country. A new road safety strategy to chart Government policy for the years ahead is being prepared and policy in relation to driver training and licensing will be further considered in this context.In relation to driving instruction, proposals being developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction involve a test of the competence of individual instructors, or exemption from this requirement where an instructor is accredited to an organisation of driving instructors recognised by my Department as meeting appropriate quality standards. The design of these standards is at present being formulated by a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests. It is envisaged that as part of this process an organisation will have to seek accreditation from the National Accreditation Board that they are operating to a set standard. The legislative basis for implementing these proposals is contained in the Road Traffic Act 2002.On driver licensing, the only change I have made to date is the introduction of a requirement effective from 1 January 2003 that a person while driving, and a person acting as an accompanying  driver to a provisionally licensed driver, must have their licences with them. Furthermore, I have announced that measures will be taken to reduce long-term reliance on a provisional licence. Under the Road Traffic Acts, a provisional licence may be granted to a person who wishes to learn how to drive a vehicle in order to pass a driving test. This licence provisionally allows a person to drive that vehicle in a public place. Over the years various changes have been made to the regulatory conditions under which provisional licences have effect and I am considering whether further changes are desirable in this regard. In particular, I am reviewing the provision whereby holders of second provisional licences for cars are not required to be accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for that category of vehicle with a view towards ending this arrangement in the course of 2003. All other provisional licence holders other than drivers of motorcycles and work vehicles must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times when driving in a public place.

Does he propose to amend the second provisional licence system to ensure the current legislation is enforced? As we all know, the legislation is not being enforced at present. The Minister's focus should be on the driving test and driver training structure. Is he aware that nine in 20 people who sit the driving test fail? Is he aware that the most dangerous drivers on Irish roads are not provisional licence holders, as was said here before Christmas, but those who have just passed their driving test? Does he accept that there is a flaw in our driver training system when the most dangerous drivers on our roads are those who have just passed their tests? Is he aware that there has been a threefold increase in delays for people awaiting driving tests in the last month? Ours is the only country in the EU without either compulsory driver training or compulsory registration for driving instructors. Our  system is in the dark ages when it comes to driver testing and training. Our priority should be to address the backlog of driving test applicants, the statutory registration of driver training and reform of the driving test. Those should be the key priorities in the Department.

That is the motivation behind this, rather than legal niceties. The Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is working on a series of initiatives on road safety. If the Deputy has information regarding those who have just passed their tests being the most dangerous drivers I would like to examine it. That is the second time he has made that suggestion and I would be keen to see the details, as I do not have that information officially from the National Safety Council or the Department. All the evidence I have suggests the most dangerous group of driv ers is still those with provisional licences and 20% of all drivers are provisional licence holders. A substantial number of that group are drivers of motorcycles, trucks and articulated vehicles so I agree with the Deputy that the present structure needs a radical overhaul. That is what I am trying to do. The failure rate nationally is 52 to 53%, depending on the part of the country one looks at. It is roughly 50-50.

When I announced the changes and reforms with which I wanted to proceed, I flushed out a lot of people who rushed off and applied for tests. The average waiting time is now 18 weeks nationally. In Letterkenny it is 13 weeks, in Sligo it is 14 weeks, in Finglas it is 15 weeks, in Cork it is 16 weeks and it goes up to 27 or 28 weeks in places like Churchtown. There is quite a backlog and we are working hard to clear it. I am discussing the provision of additional resources to that end with the Department of Finance. There are 108,000 applicants on the waiting list at present and 31,000 of those have been scheduled for a test.

Since then I have had a series of discussions with representatives of the CIE unions. I met with the NBRU on 11 November 2002 and with a joint ICTU and SIPTU delegation on 5 December 2002.I met with the CIE board, including the worker directors, on 11 December 2002 and I subsequently arranged for the CIE board and CIE unions to be briefed on the technical study commissioned by my Department on the restructuring of the companies. I also met each of the subsidiary boards on 27, 28 and 29 January.On 21 January, I wrote to unions renewing my invitation to meet at any time. Following on from that I again met with representatives of the unions yesterday. I had a lengthy and useful meeting with the trade unions yesterday during  which it was agreed that there would be bilateral discussions between my Department and the trade unions to explore the reform of public transport in the greater Dublin area. The objective is to conclude these discussions by the end of March.During that meeting I invited the trade unions to submit a short paper to the restructuring implementation group, which I will be convening shortly, identifying their principal concerns about the restructuring of CIE.

In an era of partnership he has failed to sit down with interested parties to explain the rationale for his proposals for CIE or to take on board the views of the people involved. Does he further accept that the concerns of workers in the CIE group are legitimate given the experience in Britain where the Government rushed headlong into the privatisation of transport services and it turned out to be an absolute disaster for commuters? Services did not improve and quickly the supposedly open market turned into a closed market with small local monopolies. Does the Minister accept that the concerns of workers in CIE are legitimate? Is he in a position to allay those concerns?Just yesterday the Minister belatedly sat down with the unions involved. Will he give a commitment to entering bilateral talks over the coming months with an open mind and not a set agenda in respect of competition? There is concern that the Minister has not learned from the experience of other countries, particularly Britain, and he is rushing into this headlong because he is ideologically hung up on the issue of competition without having regard to the experience where competition is not necessarily a good thing in respect of public transport.

I am making two proposals: that the CIE holding company will be dissolved and the three companies will operate independently to provide choice to people and competitive pressure, which the country needs, and that from January 2004 we will open up 25% of the Dublin market to franchising. I am not talking about the British model of deregulation and naked competition, I am talking about controlled, organised, structured competition under a regulator, allowing the people of Dublin an increasingly better service. There is no mystery about  this and I have been clear with the unions about it.This is not ideological. I do not propose the privatisation of the company, I propose the opening of the market. I would be interested to hear the view of the Labour Party on the opening up of markets in public transport so that I will know what I am debating. I am for opening the market, having discussed it with the unions, to bring about a better public service. Dublin Bus is a great company but it is not entitled to be the only company in the city.

We should have access to it. It will still be necessary to have an operating company to carry out the operations CIE currently carries out. I do not, therefore, understand the rationale behind the breaking up of the group. Surely it should be possible to return the powers the Minister wants without breaking up the company, given that it is accepted there is a need for some holding company.The consultants' report states that performance indicators should be in place. The Minister should put them in place before criticising Dublin Bus for the way it carries out its functions.

One report states that there will not be additional new rail lines and the other report says there will. A major problem in public transport in recent years is that we have had so many reports of plans and progress but so little action. I urge the Minister to be quick in  presenting the report to Cabinet and bringing it before the House for proper debate.Some of the new public transport proposals that it might contain should also be implemented as a matter of urgency. Does the Minister agree that new commuter rail services from Cork to Youghal, Galway to Tuam and Dublin to Navan are the best way forward to curtail the long distance car commuting which has become characteristic of Ireland? Will the Minister ensure that such investment projects are given priority in the lifetime of the Government? What timeframe does this report embody? Does it consider investment proposals that will be enacted within the next five years or will implementation take longer?

There are many issues in it to be addressed. We are making a substantial investment in the railways, as the Deputy knows from our local area. We are committed to the full development of Luas and the lines from Tallaght and Sandyford should be up and running in 2004.Some of the report has entered the public arena, but overall it takes a 20 year view of where we should go with the railways, which ones we should prioritise and which are unsuitable for prioritising. It also goes into rail freight in some detail, a thorny but important subject in terms of getting transport off the roads. When the report is published we can have a full debate on it.The Deputy will recognise that we must identify priorities. We cannot undertake all projects immediately. We will start with the projects that are most efficient and decongest the roads most quickly. That is our priority.

We have the roads part of the plan but we do not have the public transport part. If talk were tracks, we would have the best public transport system in the world. I have been involved in this debate for 15 years and we started talking about the Luas 15 years ago but it is still not operational. We need to get away from timeframes of 15 or 20 years for public transport and start implementing plans immediately. Will the Minister review the transport element of the national development plan?

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I have asked the National Roads Authority in determining the allocation of funding to individual roads projects in 2003 to give priority to projects on the major inter-urban routes, to PPP projects and projects in the BMW region. This request reflected the need to maintain progress on upgrading the key inter-urban routes which link the major urban centres, the importance of getting some of the PPP projects to construction so as to maintain good market interest in the PPP programme given the significant level of private sector funding which the programme will bring to the national roads programme and the need to restore more balance in the investment in national roads between the southern, eastern and BMW regions.These priorities are in line with the strategic framework set out by the Government in the NDP for the development of the national roads network. It is a matter for the NRA, within this framework, to allocate funding to individual projects having regard to the funding available. It is important to note that the priorities set for the 2003 allocations do not require the NRA to allocate all the funding available to these priorities nor do they preclude the NRA from funding other priority projects across the national road network.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank the Minister for his reply. What does the Minister consider to be a priority? Last March when the Taoiseach visited Ennis, he said the Ennis bypass was a priority. When the Minister met a deputation from Clare County Council recently, he said the Ennis bypass was a priority and that he would communicate that to the NRA. The Ennis bypass could have started in 2002 if the tender process had not been suspended in October 2001. While I do not want to pre-empt the projects or allocations the NRA will announce next week, why is an archaeological survey required for the Ennis bypass, given that it could take nine months to complete?

It is its call. The Ennis bypass has the necessary statutory approval. Tendering will resume as soon as the NRA allocates funding to it. Land acquisition of €10 million was undertaken in 2002. However, that was not sufficient to allow the project to proceed to construction. The National Roads Authority will advise further on the allocations for 2003. The Ennis bypass was allocated €10 million in 2002, but only €8.3 million was spent. There seems to have been an underspend. The Ennis bypass is a priority for the Government and the National Roads Authority. We are getting there.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I apologise. Given that Shannon Airport is an important issue at present and that we are making the headlines for the wrong reasons, it is important that the Ennis bypass is given the go-ahead as access is important. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said this morning on local radio that this issue would have to be addressed, given the damage done recently to Shannon Airport.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	259	My view is that the scheme should go ahead as soon as possible. I would like it to go ahead later this year if at all possible. However, as the Deputy rightly said, I must await the National Roads Authority's assessment of prioritisation. We secured substantial extra fund ing in the budget this year with an increase from €1 billion to €1.2 billion for national roads. That will bring the project forward.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	260	With the integration of the functions relating to national roads and public transport in the Department of Transport on the formation of the Government in June last, there is now scope for more effective and efficient allocation of departmental resources between both sectors. However, because of under-investment in the past, there will be ongoing need for significant investment both in roads and in public transport over the coming years. In response, the Government has been proactive through the NDP in providing for a major and sustained increase in investment in transport infrastructure and services and funding for the transport sector has been increased in the current year over last year. Major projects in both the roads and public transport areas are proceeding.When considering the balance between investment in roads and public transport, it is important to bear in mind that roads are the predominant form of internal transport carrying 95% of passenger traffic and 93% of freight traffic and, accordingly, that a high quality road network is of critical importance in underpinning ongoing growth and development and more balanced regional development; that a good road network is necessary to support a good bus service which is the predominant form of public transport at present; that investment in the roads network, in addition to facilitating economic and social development, will provide substantial road safety dividends and an improved quality of life in many towns and villages; and that rail-based transport offers an attractive and environmentally friendly alternative to the bus and the car where mass movement is required in urban areas and over longer distances.It will be clear from what I have said that our response to the growth in transport demand does not involve just building more roads. These are undoubtedly needed, but they are being provided in the context of an integrated approach to transport requirements, including also major improvements in public transport, improved traffic management, promotion of alternative modes, better co-ordination of transport and land use planning and, particularly in the greater Dublin area, the management of road transport demand.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I am off the substitute bench for today only because Deputy Crowe is abroad on an important international mission. Perhaps the Minister will advise me of the status of the Dublin to Sligo road because it was supposed to proceed.  As regards the railways, I would love to use rail transport more often to come here from County Louth. However, Compassion In World Farming would not allow cattle to be put in some of the carriages as a result of overcrowding. Commuters are forced to travel to and from Dublin in such conditions on a daily basis. I am aware that is also the case on other lines. Perhaps the Minister will advise me when the rail service will be improved. When will the report on the rail service be published?As regards the bus service, why does it receive the lowest level of subvention of any EU state? The privatised London bus service receives a higher level of subvention than Dublin Bus. There are discussions about privatising or part privatising it, but weakening the service will not help the people of this city and those who visit it on a daily basis. Why has investment in Luas been cut by 9% this year? That means there will be further delays in completing that project.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The Deputy raised a few issues. In relation to the Sligo road, the National Roads Authority is looking at that situation but I have not got specific details on the progress of that consideration. As the Deputy is aware, a considerable part of that road has been dealt with by the NRA, which intends to come back to the issue. As I said earlier, the rail review will be published shortly and I hope that will provide an opportunity for a good debate in the House on our railways, in which I believe we should continue to invest. I will say more about that at the appropriate time.With regard to the Deputy's point in relation to UK buses, I welcome this opportunity to dispel that myth. I visited London recently for discussions with bus authority people. For many years they have had a franchise model for buses in London city, as is the case in Stockholm. The number of passengers has grown dramatically, the number of bus drivers employed has increased dramatically and the level of services to the public has improved substantially. Whatever disorganisation occurred in deregulation in that case resulted mainly from a foolish decision by the British Government to put the rail track into private ownership. That is not a move which I would support. I believe that our infrastructure should be publicly owned, including railways, runways and, eventually, roads. However, the operators of services on those facilities need not necessarily be State dominated. On another occasion, I will comment further on the UK situation. There is a great deal of mythology surrounding it and those impressions are not borne out by the figures which I have studied carefully, apart from the one major mistake to which I have referred and which had to be reversed.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I wonder how bus drivers in Dublin might react in a similar situation.

With regard to Luas investment, I agree there is a different figure for this year – the Deputy is correct in that regard – but it is a capital project. The profile of public spending on major capital projects is not a straight line graph. It goes up and down, depending on the amount of work in progress on site.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Would Action Aid be of any help?

As a project comes towards conclusion, the volume of expenditure levels off. There is no delay on the Luas project due to funding.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 92, 104, 267, 270 and 272 together.A guiding objective for me is to improve accessibility to work, business and services through the reduction of absolute travel times and journey time variances for individuals and firms. The key strategies for achieving this are by improving public transport within cities and improving key national road routes outside cities. This is being implemented through a major investment in public transport. In particular,  within the framework of the national development plan, a wide range of initiatives has been taken to upgrade Dublin's transport infrastructure and services and reduce congestion and associated costs. This includes both heavy and light rail services, bus services, and measures such as quality bus corridors and cycle lanes. Investment in both bus and rail services nationally has also been undertaken.I am also committed to the full implementation in the years ahead of the national roads programme provided for in the NDP. This will improve the reliability of the road transport system by removing bottlenecks and remedying capacity deficiencies. Investment in national roads is being complemented by a sustained high level of investment in the non-national roads programme overseen by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Is the Minister satisfied with service targets which have been set down by Irish Rail in relation to suburban and DART routes? Is he aware that there is a 78% performance rate on the DART service and a 62% performance rate on the Connolly Station-Maynooth line? That equates to two out of every ten DART trains being late and four out of every ten trains on the Maynooth line being late. Is the Minister satisfied with that?Has the Minister given any consideration to the introduction of PSO – public service – contracts, especially in light of the new partnership and benchmarking agreements? Both of those agreements gave firm commitments in relation to performance and accountability.When will integrated ticketing come into operation? Does the Minister agree that, in line with any opening up or franchising of public transport services in the greater Dublin area, integrated ticketing must be considered?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I share the Deputy's interest in securing an improvement by Irish Rail in timetables, efficiency and performance. At a recent meeting I reminded the board of Irish Rail of the wish of this House that those services should continue to be improved. I particularly mentioned the DART, in which very substantial additional public funds are now being invested to lengthen the platforms, increase train sizes from six to eight carriages and improve timing. The present capacity of a DART train is approximately 900 passengers. The change from six to eight carriages will increase the capacity to about 1,300. That change of configuration will bring a substantial improvement.With regard to PSOs, we are committed to signing agreements with the three companies during 2003. The services of the three companies are procured. In relation to integrated ticketing, I fully accept that this is a must in any franchising model, as is the integration of the management of the network.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	270	In relation to DART, was consent obtained from the Minister's Department concerning the decision by Irish Rail to cancel the tendering process for improvement of signalling within the central corridor? What level of cost was involved and was that the reason for the cancellation of those contracts? In light of the fact that traffic gridlock costs Bus Éireann over €18 million per annum, with rush hour traffic speeds now down to five miles per hour, does the Minister agree there are severe limitations on the development of bus services in that context and that any PSO contract must take serious account of that issue? What immediate steps will the Minister take, such as expansion of Operation Freeflow throughout the year in Dublin city, to address that problem? Will the Minister indicate when he intends to introduce a mechanism for integrated ticketing, in light of the fact that he is considering the franchising out of services in the Dublin area within the next 18 months?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I am genuinely interested in the views of the Deputy and his party on the question of opening up the market. I would welcome a fuller discussion on that at some appropriate point. I believe the companies and the country are clear as to where I stand on the matter and I am interested in establishing where my colleagues in this House stand on it. I have no details on the signalling project but I will revert to the Deputy on that matter.I accept the Deputy's comments in relation to gridlock and congestion in Dublin. We have to complete the M50 and get the Luas up and running. There are also many other projects to be completed to relieve pressure on the main national routes. We are moving ahead with the Monasterevin route, the Kildare bypass is well under way and there are nine or ten other projects in hand, including the Dublin Port tunnel. When all of those are completed, that should greatly ease the pressure. However, car ownership is growing dramatically.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Does the Minister accept that the solutions to many of the problems in the Dublin area are far simpler than major infrastructural projects? He said the majority of public transport users travel on buses and that is certainly the case in the greater Dublin area. Does he agree that the two key problems in relation to buses are the traffic gridlock in the city and the lack of bus priority? The problem with bus priority is a total lack of co-ordination. As the Minister is aware, the DTO underspent its budget for bus priority by €10 million. Does this not underline the urgent need for a greater Dublin transport authority? Why has the Minister cut off that legislation?On traffic gridlock, we know that where the traffic and parking laws are enforced, as they are with Operation Freeflow at Christmas time, city traffic moves properly and buses can run to schedule. Why then has the Minister failed to secure adequate funding to provide the long  promised traffic corps and what kind of priority will he give to that now?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	273	There is a later question about the traffic corps. I agree with the Deputy that some of the solutions to congestion are simpler, as can be shown when we implement Operation Freeflow. The Dublin transport authority and I have discussed that. I recently had a meeting with the DTO and the director of traffic from Dublin Corporation at which we discussed these issues to see how we could bring about quicker solutions.Quality bus corridors, to which the Deputy referred, are clearly part of the solution. There are now nine of those covering 100 kilometres.

They are not, but it takes time to build them. There are 100 kilometres of bus lanes in the city at present and there are a further three lanes being developed as we speak. I have told the authority that the Government wants it to press ahead.There is now a new quality bus corridor office, a specialised office charged with a single job of putting in these quality bus corridors as quickly as possible. They are a major solution to freeing up buses in the city and I am a strong supporter of them.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Green Party believes the model the Minister seems to want to follow, the UK bus service privatisation, liberalisation or whatever he wants to call it, is in fact a very poor one. That is not the view of the Green Party only. We as a party were responsible for bringing over officers from the European Commission who have done extensive studies in the area of comparing the effect of liberalisation of the British model and other European models. The British model, in almost every way according to the European Commission, came across as being not the way to go.Would the Minister agree there is a manifest contradiction in our broad transport policies in regard to Dublin? We are spending billions of euros building motorways leading to the M50, and we will have to spend more billions of euros upgrading the M50 to cope with the traffic which will be pushed on to it as a result. At the same time we expect to be able to reduce traffic or try to switch people in the city over to other vehicles, spending hundreds of millions of euros on bus or other light rail transport systems. Is massive investment in rail infrastructure, to allow for long distance rail commuting rather than car commuting, not the only long-term way of avoiding gridlock in Dublin? Should that not get precedence over the motorways, which will bring traffic to an  inevitable gridlock no matter how wide we make the M50, once it hits Dublin? we cannot build all these roads and then cope with traffic when the traffic hits the city of Dublin.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I said that in the London bus market, as opposed to the other markets and as opposed to the rail, the franchising model has been successful in that narrow end of it. I recommend that the Deputy look at Stockholm as well. In Stockholm there is a regulator who designs the network and procures the services for the routes. The number of services has increased dramatically, which is what it is about at the end of the day. It is about making sure that we have more services for the public. We cannot on the one hand criticise CIE and then on the other hand say that other models should not be tried. We must try other models.On the question of investment in rail, the present level of investment on roads is €1.2 billion this year and the investment on public transport is €650 million. That is the present ratio. I hear Deputy Ryan's arguments and I understand from where he is coming, given his party's position as I understand it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The large section of the expenditure on public transport is not capital expenditure. It is ongoing funding to CIE and therefore it is duplicitous to compare one with the other. The roads expenditure is pure capital expenditure. In looking at a like-for-like comparison of capital expenditure on new public transport projects as against new road projects, the ratio is something like six to one.

It is a success during the Christmas period and it could have an immense benefit in clearing some of the congestion evident throughout the year.Would the Minister consider, in the short-term at least, running a shuttle service through the Phoenix Park tunnel to relieve the congestion experienced by commuters along the quays? What type of debate does he intend to have on the type of service to be run from the city centre to Dublin Airport or will there be any debate on whether it will be an underground, metro or heavy rail service?On the quality bus corridor office, should more resources be put into work on the ground rather than into establishing more offices to direct traffic and direct policy in Dublin? Is it true that, rather  than another bureaucratic office, all we need to establish these quality bus corridors is a can of paint and policy initiatives by the local authorities?

I agree with him about Operation Freeflow. I would like to have that operate every day of the year. It takes enormous resources. They stop all the roadworks in the city, the trainee gardaí from Templemore come out and there is a massive effort. I acknowledge that it does teach us a lesson that if we can sweat our present road assets and manage them better, we can get much more out of them.

I will discuss this further with the Deputy when the  Strategic Rail Review is published because there is another proposal in regard to this tunnel which is worth looking at.The airport metro is the way forward. I have told the Railway Procurement Agency to get on with that quickly because we need it urgently. It made a presentation to me. There is very substantial private sector interest in developing the metro from Dublin Airport to the city centre. There were a number of decisions to be taken about which of three routes through the north part of the city is more efficient. I will put that report to the Cabinet soon and we will take it before the House without too much delay.Although I do not have the figure to hand, when I visited Cork recently I recall that I was told that it costs between €1 million and €2 million to put in a quality bus corridor. Obviously one would need a fair few cans of paint for that.

More up to date statistics are not immediately available.Some of the licences would be for multiple categories of vehicle and categories may have been added to the licences at different dates. I will arrange to have a briefing note on the numbers of licences, including the numbers who hold first, second, third or subsequent provisional licences, forwarded to the Deputy concerned.Learner drivers must pass the driving test in order to be eligible for a driving licence. While the current level of applications for the driving test and the resultant backlog is unprecedented, the capacity of the driving test service to deliver tests has increased significantly in recent years. I am considering, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, what other measures can be taken to enable tests to be offered within the shortest possible time.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	305	All Members would agree with the sensible objectives the Minister has set. However, is it not the case that the Minister has jumped the gun in this regard? He has frightened many people, which is not necessarily a bad thing, and caused a rush to the driver testing centres without getting the centres in order by ensuring there is an adequate number of testers available. The Minister says he is working hard on this. What is he doing to ensure that the staff in Ballina will be able to deal with the huge increase in applications and the backlog that now exists? Second, what is he doing about the long waiting times at most of the centres? What is he doing to ensure there is an adequate number of driver testers available in the centres? There is no indication that there has been any increase in the number of testers.One of the categories of people on the lists are people whose licences have lapsed. The Taoiseach is in that position. Has the Minister considered the possibility of granting an amnesty to people who have already passed the test but whose full licences have lapsed?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I acknowledged earlier that I caused much of the backlog by laying out my intentions in this area. However, I have said many times recently that there is no need for alarm. We will make transition arrangements of some sort, although I have not yet worked out what they will be. It is not the case that somebody could be put off the road overnight.

I intend to bring forward specific proposals in this area shortly. I listened carefully to the examples mentioned by the Deputy. I am aware a cultural change is needed in this area. It is possible to be driving for eight years without taking a driving test. Some people are on provisional licences for ten to 20 years. The objective is to reduce the reliance on long-term provisional licences.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Is it not the case that given the number of recent applications, the driver testers would have to increase the number of tests they carry out by 2,500 to deal with the number of applicants and to remove the provisional licences from the system? It would take 60 weeks for each driver tester working non-stop to do that. There is a deficit in capacity. If the Minister were to recruit driver testers from Northern Ireland and the UK, would not the current failure rate of nine out of 20 increase because there is no structured driver training programme in this country?On 14 December 1999, the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Molloy, promised that statutory registration would be introduced on 1 January 2002 for driving instructors. That has not yet happened. On 10 May 2000, the Minister's predecessor gave a commitment that the driving test would be reformed. That has not happened either and, to the best of my knowledge, the consultants' report on the issue has not been published. When will we see action in that regard?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I am working on these matters as quickly as I can. The introduction of the penalty points system, and I thank the Opposition Deputies for putting on record their support for that measure, has begun to show results and to change the culture generally. That has brought a new urgency to the issues raised by the Deputies, that is, quicker testing, improved pass rates, the establishment of a new agency and proper regulation of driving instructors. I will press ahead as quickly as possible with those measures.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	315	When one gets a driving licence in the United Kingdom one has it for life, and the UK is supposed to have the best system in the European Union. When will we see driving licence renewal reminders being issued? The Minister gave a commitment last June that it  would be in place by the end of the year but that has not happened. Will the Minister introduce an amnesty for people whose licences have lapsed? It is possible within the current EU regulations on driving licences to allow them to be renewed, as is the case in the UK. Will the Minister bring forward proposals in that regard? It is causing huge difficulty at present.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I accept that. I will take up the issue of the renewal reminders. The office in Ballina is swamped at present. The number of applications is substantial, many times more than it has ever been previously. There are over 100,000 applications on hand so I am reluctant to put further pressure on the system without getting the additional resources I mentioned. We might buy in those resources if that is possible. I am examining that option at present.I doubt that an amnesty is appropriate, given the focus on road safety and penalty points. However, I am conscious that there are anomalies and hard cases. There are also social issues, particularly in rural areas. I am equally conscious, nevertheless, that a generation of people have spent 12 to 15 years on provisional licences with no intention of ever applying for the test.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	317	Is it not the case that the Minister has already bought in the resources through the penalty points system? That is tied into the national drivers file. Would it not be possible to issue the renewal reminders through that system? When the Minister made his announcement about the provisional licences he told his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party that he would put short-term transitional arrangements in place. Can he outline the type of transitional arrangements involved? The Minister also said at that time that he intended to have talks with driving instructors about the implementation of statutory registration. His predecessor had such talks a number of years ago. Has this Minister had those talks yet? Has he arranged meetings for them?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	318	A number of discussions have taken place about statutory regulation and we are committed to pressing forward with it quickly. We have not yet decided on the transitional arrangements. If the Deputy has proposals in that regard, I will study them carefully. Giving people time to get their affairs in order will be my guiding philosophy, as it were. In other words, we will make it clear that by a certain date people will have to get their licences sorted out. We will give them time to do that.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Is the Minister thinking of weeks, months or years?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	320	At present a person can drive for between five and eight years on one licence. If one does the test and fails it, one gets into the loop again so one can get up to 20 years on only  two tests. That is the situation at present. Timing will be the way to deal with the transition. We will also try to make some arrangements for serious cases, such as those raised by the Deputies. I do not have a solution to it today.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I wish to clarify my point about an amnesty. Deputy Naughten was making the same point. We are talking about an amnesty for people who previously held full licences and whose licences have lapsed. Surely it would make sense to take those people out of the system by re-issuing their licences. Will the Minister outline his intentions in that regard?The Minister mentioned a long lead-in time but also said that he would introduce penalty points in this regard by the end of this year. What steps has he taken to date to ensure that the system will be able to deal with that huge increase? The Minister says he is looking at the possibility of bringing people in from Northern Ireland. Has he any plans for a recruitment campaign for additional drivers? What discussions has he had with the authorities in Northern Ireland?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	322	What I have actually done in this area is bring the penalty points system forward and get it up and running. I gather that up to 3,000 penalty points have been awarded so far. We have had extensive discussions—

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Is it correct that the Minister will not introduce that penalty until the end of this year?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	326	That is correct. What I have been doing is introducing penalty points in the first instance, holding discussions with the Department of Finance about the possibility of recruiting extra testers and holding discussions with Northern Ireland and UK interests to see if we can do something there to dramatically reduce the backlog. I do not think that amnesties in the general sense are appropriate in this case given the road safety aspect. I will look at what we can do in the types of cases the Deputy has raised. I do not have the answer now but we will address the matter shortly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 93 together.The 2003 Estimates provision of €1.262 billion for the national roads improvement and maintenance programme – an increase of over 10% on the 2002 outturn – will enable good progress to be maintained in the upgrading of the national roads network. The allocation of the funding available to individual projects is, as I explained earlier, a matter for the National Roads Authority.Overall, however, the provision, which is approximately three times the 1997 level of investment, will fund the completion of 11 major projects throughout the country; the ongoing work on six other projects; the start of work on up to seven new projects; land acquisition and archaeological and other preparatory work on a number of major schemes, clearing the way for tendering later in the year; further substantial work on projects in planning and design to enable these projects to get to construction as quickly as possible; and a strong restoration programme on national secondary routes and continued progress on road safety improvement schemes throughout the country .The 2003 Estimates provision will maintain the pace and momentum of the programme built up over the last three years. Financial resources on their own, however, will not be sufficient to guarantee the benefits we want from the major investment now being made in the upgrading of the national roads network. Projects need to be delivered efficiently and cost effectively. Tight cost control and delivery of projects within budget and on time must be the foremost guiding principle of programme implementation.In this context, a wide range of measures have been taken by the NRA, which is responsible for the management and implementation of the national roads programme, to improve cost estimation and control and to secure greater certainty in the outturn cost of individual projects. These include the appointment of specialist cost estimation staff, the publication of revised specifications, reduction in carriageway width and the greater use of the design and build form of contract, which secures greater certainty of outturn cost.In addition, a group of senior officials, chaired by my Department, is currently considering additional funding options for the national roads programme. As part of its work the group is considering the scope for further improvements in cost estimation and control procedures, including the greater use of fixed price contracts. These measures, together with the moderation in construction cost inflation that has occurred over the  past year, will assist in achieving greater output for our investment programme going forward.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Does the Minister accept that the recent cost overruns in the road building programme are unacceptable and represent bad value for money for the taxpayer? The Minister has been reported as being angry about this fact, but what is he doing to ensure that we get value for money? Has his Department carried out any examination of the current type of contracts that the NRA awards? Has he satisfied himself that those contracts are adequate in terms of containing penalty clauses for cases where contractors fail to meet deadlines?I also wish to raise the practice of employing engineering consultants on a contract that represents a percentage of the total cost of a road project, thereby leaving no incentive to keep costs down. This form of contract has been heavily criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in other arenas. Does the Minister accept the need to move away from that type of percentage contract because it does not lead to cost effective projects? What steps is he taking to review those types of contracts?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Like everybody else, I share the Deputy's worry, even anger, at the fact that we spent billions over the years on our national roads network but produced 20% less road for that money than was originally intended. The reasons given to me for that are increases in land costs, changes in designs, compulsory purchase order difficulties and construction inflation. For five or six years we were throwing money at the NRA and construction firms and telling them to get on with building the roads. An enormous amount of funds was poured into chasing a capacity that was not there to deliver the programme, and that caused construction inflation.We must learn from that lesson. I attended a board meeting of the NRA recently and laid out the Government's attitude. We want certainty in delivery of roads, as many fixed price contracts as possible and penalty clauses like those to which Deputy Shorthall referred. An assistant secretary of my Department is now on the board of the National Roads Authority, thus ensuring a strong link between the Department and the NRA. I have requested that the percentage method of paying consultants be examined, but above all, I have asked the NRA to provide certainty and more design and build-type contracts. Overall, I have delivered the message this House would want me to deliver – that money is tighter now, even though we are giving them more of it. I have agreed with the Minister for Finance a rolling programme on road investment over a three-year period, which will help a lot.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I first declare an interest, in that the proposed new motorway to the west will run through my own family farm. My first question relates to the decision taken by the Minister for  Finance in the budget about changes to capital gains tax, and the impact this will have on compulsory purchase orders and land acquisition. Has this been factored into the overall cost for the construction of road projects? Given the difficulties the Government had in negotiating with the IFA on this, it will cause friction on the ground when compulsory purchase orders are served.I understand there is a proposal from the National Roads Authority to the Department of Transport to toll roads such as the Jack Lynch tunnel, the Portlaoise bypass and sections of the M50. This would equate to a stealth tax on employment and industry in the regions. The alternative routes on all of these sections of road are already congested and would become even more congested if tolls were introduced. I ask the Minister to reject these proposals because the roads have already been funded and paid for by the State.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The roll-over relief is a budgetary matter, and I expect it will add to the costs of the National Roads Authority. We will, to an extent, take a hit on that. The previous Government and, so far, the present Government, have taken the view that tolling existing roads would not be the right way to go. It is something we must keep under constant review, however, in light of the level of income we have to fund future roads. The Monasterevin road is not built yet, and tolling could be considered in that context, whereas the Jack Lynch tunnel has been open for many years. Whatever case there is for applying tolls to roads that are not yet built, even those built by public funds, there is not much of a case for revisiting roads already in use. This has to be kept under constant review because policies may change.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The public will be increasingly angry when they realise the hundreds of millions of euro that have been wasted in this area. Would the Minister agree that one of the main causes of this is that the NRA has been unaccountable to this House and to the general public in recent years? The inability of politicians and the media to raise questions of public interest to the NRA has allowed it to get away with contracts such as the percentage contracts where the engineers involved would be penalised by their companies if they did not increase the price by as much as possible. Does the Minister agree we need the NRA to be more openly accountable? Perhaps we need the Freedom of Information Act to be applied to it. We need a review of the rules where Deputies cannot ask questions of the NRA.If PPPs are to be used in road construction will the Minister agree that new contract arrangements be open to debate in the House prior to signing? I do not want commercially sensitive information on a specific contract – I want the House to be able to determine whether we are getting value of money in any PPP. I am told this  is not possible; if this is the case we will continue to waste money as we have done for the past five years.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I have some sympathy for the Deputy's point. I do not intend to hide behind the NRA in my dealings with this House. I will bring all non-commercially sensitive information to the House and welcome the views of the House on what our road building priorities should be. A professional body established by statute, like the NRA, is the most appropriate body to do a job. Broad policy frameworks are still given by Government. I will keep a close watch on the NRA's accountability to the House. This House should be better informed on the strategies and financing without dipping our fingers into contractual items. Committees of the House can question the NRA and I encourage them to do that.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	334	What are the Minister's views on the new tendering process under which a number of road contracts may be awarded this year? Under it, the contractor may not get paid for 12 months after starting the job. How many projects does the Minister envisage will be carried out in this way this year?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The Deputy is referring to the offer from some roads developers to construct roads and not seek funding until the road is handed over.

Enormous investment must be made and we must keep an open mind on how we source funding. Tolling is one method, but it is not a panacea for solving the problem as it causes traffic jams and sometimes the private sector receives an undue slice of the cake. This has already happened on a few occasions and I would not like to see it repeated. It may be worth examining if it is possible for the State to collect tolls and invest them in other roads.

This Bill seeks to address the problem in so far as it relates to terrorist funds. Money laundering is an insidious crime and the laundering of the proceeds of drugs trafficking and terrorism frequently overlaps. Launderers have a "shopping list" to size up specific opportunities when searching for jurisdictions to use. Knowing the countries on this list can give rise to specific measures states can adopt to fight money laundering, particularly terrorist related money laundering.Secure communications is a prerequisite for effective co-ordination among terrorists and their criminal counterparts. The Internet provides another potential avenue of communication between terrorist and criminal groups that use websites for communications and command and control purposes. This Bill is timely in so far as it proposes to proscribe terrorist organisations operating both within and without the State for promoting, encouraging or advocating terrorist linked activity.I have reservations in respect of section 4 of the framework decision on combating terrorism adopted by the EU in 2002. It defines a terrorist offence as an act "unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform any act". I note the Minister's reassurance that the Bill does not make it an offence to seek change or campaign for a cause. However, I recall incidents where pro-life activists were charged with public order offences when marches descended into disorder, not always of the activists' making. Are such people to be characterised as terrorists?My principal fear is that sweeping and draconian powers introduced in an atmosphere of tension and build-up to a conflict would be applied indiscriminately to individuals or organisations for which terrorism represents the ultimate atrocity.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The need for a global  commitment to combating the causes and the symptoms of international terrorism was tragically highlighted on 11 September 2001. International terrorism has a long and horrific history, but the sheer scale of loss of life, fear and economic devastation caused by those attacks helped create the overdue consensus necessary to agree a comprehensive international response. The international response, in the shape of UN Resolution 1373, calls on all states to work to create permanent barriers to terrorism, from its funding to its methods of operation.A new framework of executive and legislative and executive actions against terrorism is being constructed around the world. This Bill will ensure Ireland does all it can to make the framework as effective as possible and we stand in solidarity with our partners in the EU and the UN in working to ensure terrorists are denied both the means and the opportunity to carry out further atrocities.Major advances in technology, increased financial flows and cheaper transport costs are characteristic of increasing globalisation but have proven to be deadly enablers for international terrorism. The international terrorist threat today stems from the activities of networks based in several countries that exploit legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations. Such loopholes have allowed international terrorist groups the freedom to organise, fundraise and carry out atrocities. Perpetrators of terrorism in one country have frequently used other states as safe havens for fund raising. They have received training abroad, used foreign countries as launching pads for their operations elsewhere and found refuge in sympathetic regimes and secretive banking systems. Their availability to take advantage of this enabling international environment has allowed them to kill, maim and terrify innocent people.Terrorism can take many forms from threats to people's lives to kidnappings and hostage takings, bodily harm and murder. It can involve the destruction of private or public property. New forms of terrorism are constantly appearing as terrorist groups become more and more sophisticated in their methods. Cyber-terrorism and biological terrorism are examples of such a new threat. We must ensure that we have effective measures to deal with all forms of terrorist threat. The determination to counter international terrorism in all its forms is at the heart of the EU framework decision and the UN convention on terrorism which is implemented in this Bill.The EU framework decision on combating terrorism is the result of increased co-operation at European level in this area over many years and increased commitment among member states to tackling the terrorism threat in the wake of 11 September. The European Union has long been concerned about the need to improve co-operation among member states with a view to combating terrorism. Article 29 of the Maastricht treaty specifically refers to terrorism as one of the  serious forms of crime to be combated at EU level by developing common action in the fields of police and judicial co-operation and by approximating, where necessary, rules on criminal matters in member states. Terrorism was also specifically referred to in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in October 1999 and in the European Council meeting in June 2000.The comprehensive action plan against terrorism agreed by the European Council on 21 September 2001 focused on formulating an appropriate response to the terrorist threat highlighted by the attacks in New York. The plan was arranged under the following headings, enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing international legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism, strengthening air security and co-ordinating the EU's overall actions. Since then a comprehensive range of measures have been adopted in the implementation of the plan, including a political agreement in December 2001 of a framework decision on combating terrorism, which was formally adopted by the Council in June 2002.The significance of the agreement of the framework decision is evident in the fact that prior to its conclusion the majority of EU states did not have specific legislation on terrorism. Of those which had, only four, Spain, Greece, the UK and Portugal, had adopted a definition of terrorism in that legislation. The definitions adopted varied from country to country, as did the scale of punishments imposed. In addition, persons held responsible for offences who were outside the state of the judge or court responsible for dealing with the case could only be brought to trial through the extradition procedure.The framework decision represented EU level agreement on a common definition of terrorist groups and terrorist offences, on the adoption of common maximum penalties for different categories of terrorist offences across all member states, and the abolition of the formal extradition procedure between member states for bringing those accused of terrorist offences to justice.The framework decision also established that a member state, which under its law does not extradite its own nationals, will be required to establish jurisdiction over terrorist offences and offences of instigating, aiding, abetting and attempting to commit a terrorist offence when committed by its own nationals on the territory of another member state or against another member state's institutions or people. To enable prosecutions to take place in such cases, the decision states that the member state in which the offence or conduct was committed shall forward to the competent authorities of the other state all relevant files, information and exhibits and that the requesting state shall be informed of the initiation and outcome of any prosecution. It is this level of political commitment to addressing the administrative and legal gaps that terrorists groups can exploit at present that is vital to ensuring an effec tive European response to international terrorism.The framework decision represents an EU level agreement on a definition of terrorist groups and terrorist offences, something that has proven difficult to agree in negotiations on each of the UN conventions related to terrorism. The agreement of common definitions and penalties relating to terrorism in all member states will ensure that there is no soft jurisdiction in the EU in which terrorists can operate. It will also ensure smoother cross-border co-operation in dealing with terrorism. The definition of terrorist offences as those which are "intentionally committed by an individual or a group against one or more countries, their institutions or people with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of a country" is a fair and workable one. I agree with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the main Opposition spokesperson that this definition by no means poses a threat to the peaceful anti-globalisation movement or other protest groups.In giving effect to the EU framework decision on combating terrorism, we will make provision, for the first time, for terrorist offences as a separate and distinct category of Irish law. We will improve our procedures for police and judicial co-operation with other member states. We will adopt common EU maximum penalties for terrorist offences and we will be confident that we are playing our part in establishing a determined, concerted and effective European response to the threat of international terrorism.This Bill also ensures that we meet the United Nations call for all states to ratify all relevant terrorism conventions as soon as possible. The Bill creates specific offences in Irish law for the purpose of each of the three conventions on terrorist bombings, hostage taking and crime against internationally protected persons. It also ensures that we meet the requirement to take extra territorial jurisdiction in certain circumstances. It builds on the strength of existing Irish legislation and procedures for dealing with terrorist offences and ensures that gaps between existing offences specified in Irish law are filled. In adopting these provisions, we will ensure that we conform to the highest agreed international legal standards for dealing with terrorism.The financing of terrorism is an area of great concern, particularly in the context of the massive increase in international financial flows in recent years. Tackling the financing of terrorism is vital if we are to prevent future atrocities as the number, scale and lethality of acts of international terrorism is dependent upon the financial resources that terrorist groups can raise. Any national or international strategy to combat the terrorist threat must seek to stem the flows of financial support to terrorist groups. Only if all states implement effective procedures to monitor and control cash transfers and to improve their bank disclosure procedures can the international com munity be confident about its ability to trace terrorists and their benefactors, yet prior to the agreement of the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism there was no agreed multilateral legal instrument which expressly addressed the financing of terrorism.In implementing the provisions of the UN convention, this Bill will create a new offence under Irish law of financing terrorism, which will ensure that our financial institutions are legally required to play their part in preventing, detecting and reporting suspicious financial transactions, which may relate to the financing of terrorism. It will enable the courts to freeze and confiscate funds used or allocated for use in connection with the offence of the financing of terrorism or funds that are the proceeds of such an offence. It will extend the provisions of the Offences against the State Act relating to the property of unlawful organisations to that of terrorist groups. In short, it will ensure that we have the most sophisticated procedures for identifying and tracing the financing of terrorism and for punishing those guilty of financing terrorism and receiving funds which are being used to finance terrorism.The remarkable speed with which the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism has been signed and ratified by member states illustrates the level of international commitment to implementing effective measures to starve terrorist organisations of the means to carry out acts of violence. By the time the convention came into force in April 2002, 132 countries had signed it and 26 countries had completed the ratification process and become state parties. Today there are 68 parties to the convention. In implementing its provisions we can be confident not only that we are fulfilling our responsibility to the international community but also that the international community, in the guise of the growing number of other states which have ratified or are in the process of ratifying the convention, are fulfilling their moral and legal obligation to us.State parties to the convention are obligated to bring their laws into agreement with the convention and to develop and implement mechanisms to meet the standard it sets out. They must also ensure that criminal acts covered by the convention will, under no circumstances, be considered justifiable, for example, due to any political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic or religious considerations. The convention obliges state parties to prosecute offenders or to extradite them to the parties which suffered from their illegal acts. State parties are required to co-operate with and assist other states in investigations and preventative efforts. For example, a state party may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on the grounds of banking secrecy. In becoming a party to the convention, we will form a part of an improved international legal framework for suppressing the financing of terrorism.If we are to combat terrorism in all its forms, we must not only choke terrorist groups of funds, we must also starve them of volunteers. We must ensure that the actions of those who eschew peaceful, democratic methods of dispute resolution and use lethal and indiscriminate violence to further a political goal meet with the severest penalties available to us as legislators. I welcome the fact that extended maximum sentences for terrorist offences are provided for in the Bill. I know other Members have called for minimum mandatory sentences as well. This is the road we reluctantly went down with drugs legislation.Whatever the outcome, we must send a clear message to those who would contemplate participation in or financing of terrorist groups that the personal consequences of their actions will be severe. We must bring to justice those who plan, prepare or perpetrate terrorist acts and those who provide support whether it be in the form of financing, logistics, training or other support for terrorist acts. The Bill will increase our ability to do that.The legislation also represents Ireland's role in adopting the highest internationally agreed level of measures to combat international terrorism. In passing it, we will be in good company with our EU partners in adopting the provisions of the framework decision and with those states that have already become party to or, like us, are in the process of becoming party to the UN conventions on terrorism.As much as it is vital to implement the most stringent security measures possible at national and international level to defeat terrorism, we must always remember that we will not defeat terrorism by security measures alone. The international community must do all in its power to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism. We must ensure that the elimination of world poverty and injustice, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the creation of a greater understanding between different cultures and faiths become greater priorities in the year ahead.Poverty, injustice and marginalisation from the global trading system help to create sympathy for terrorist movements among many of the four fifths of the world's population that live in—

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	351	In this age of over-consumption and environmental strain in the developed world, 14 million children die each year before they reach the age of five. Some 13 million people face immediate starvation in southern Africa. Half the world's population live on less than $2 a day.The increasing polarisation that has been characteristic of the post-war global economy is frightening. In 1960 the income ratio of the 20% of the world's population living in the richest countries to the 20% living in the poorest countries was 30:1. By 1990 it was 60:1 and by 1997 it was 74:1. Even with all the advances in science and technology in recent decades, an estimated 2.6 billion people still lack access to proper sanitation, one billion cannot meet basic consumption requirements and 30% of the global labour force is underemployed or unemployed.The crippling debt burdens of many states, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, their over-reliance on low value, primary commodities and their marginal role in international trading and financial blocs has led to a widespread feeling of systematic injustice among their populations. While some progress on addressing poverty was made at last year's Earth Summit in Johannesburg, the pace of progress must be increased dramatically if the international community is to demonstrate a full commitment to eliminating poverty and injustice.The link between poverty and global security cannot be overstated. Poverty is the ultimate systemic threat and the incredible resolve that is evident in the fight against global terrorism must be extended to the fight against poverty if we are to make real success and progress in promoting global security.The failure of peaceful methods of conflict resolution can also help to attract new recruits to a terrorist cause. The experience of conflict resolution in Northern Ireland through delicate, difficult and frustrating times is evidence that any dispute can be resolved through peaceful, democratic and inclusive mechanisms. There is no justification in this day and age for resorting to violent attacks on innocent civilians in furtherance of a political aim.

I come from County Louth where we have seen for many years the hooded and often naked bodies of people who have been murdered by one side or the other and left on the border with our county. Something which therefore strikes a chord with me and, I am sure, everyone in the country is the extent and extremes to which terrorists have gone. I hope they will no longer go to those extremes now that they have engaged with democratic institutions and are welcome in Parliament. How things can change.It is important that countries deal with and resolve the causes of terrorism, if possible. Since 11 September, our views on terrorism have changed. Before this we thought that terrorists would not indulge in suicide bombing or the awful extreme acts that took place in America on that day. We must be much more alert and committed to dealing with and fighting international terrorism than we ever thought would be necessary. I support the legislation on these grounds.The definition of a terrorist is an important part of the legislation. People may differ as to that definition. I am not a legal person but we all know what is meant by someone acting politically to kill or take another person's life.I notice from the legislation that protocols attach to the transportation of nuclear material. The movement of such material in the United Kingdom or on the Irish Sea concerns me. In the absence of a clear military presence escorting these ships on the Irish Sea, they are theoretically under potential threat from terrorism. By introducing legislation in different countries I hope we will have the power, which may be contained in this Bill, to resort to directly questioning other governments as to how they are dealing with this situation if and when it arises. What protocols exist for dealing with this serious issue? It is theoretically possible that a nuclear transport ship passing through the Irish Sea could be seized by terrorists and the Government should ensure there is transparency about what the British Government is doing to protect these. While I acknowledge armed police from the atomic energy police force in the UK are on board these ships, that is not adequate.There is a real possibility of a dirty bomb or other activities, which can easily be carried out by determined terrorists. Based on information from the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are serious reports about the question of nuclear terrorism and its importance. A report on those dangers has been in the hands of the Government since last November. I requested that report under the Freedom of Information Act, but was refused on the basis that a period of two years must pass before that can be put in the public domain. In his reply the Minister should specifically address the issues about which he can talk, like the threat of terrorist attacks on nuclear transport ships or the threat to Sellafield.I challenge those on this side of the House who talk about Sellafield on where they stand on the threat of international terrorism. What are their views on the point at which protest changes into terrorism? One of the main concerns I have about international terrorism is the possibility of an attack on Sellafield. From my viewing of that area there does not appear to be any obvious physical military presence. I would welcome such a presence. Would those who are active in the campaign at Shannon Airport, not welcome a real physical military presence at Sellafield? I certainly would. I am opposed to the war in Iraq as such and I support the notion of peaceful protest. However, I am concerned that Sellafield is not adequately protected by a physical military presence on site. That needs to be established immediately.In addition to a possible terrorist threat on the ground, I am also concerned about a possible aerial threat. What is the Government doing about the fact that the no-fly zone over Sellafield extends only to 2,000 feet? An aircraft fully laden with aviation fuel – as were those used on 11 September 2001 – would arrive right at the heart of Sellafield in milliseconds and the Government is not doing enough to make sure a physical presence exists on site at Sellafield to repel such an attack. I say that in the context of this Bill and the concerns everybody has at the possibility of such an incident.I am concerned about international terrorism and the issues that arise in the context of the potential war with Iraq. Everybody would agree that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant, his agents are also tyrants and they do the most evil and awful things, which would not be tolerated in any democracy. Whatever happens in terms of terrorism and the threat to world peace, if there is a war in Iraq that has the consent of the United Nations – and it must have such consent – I would support such a war. In that context we must think seriously about where we stand as democrats on the issue of Iraq, the mandate of the United Nations and the mandate of democracy as a whole.I welcome this legislation. We must be firm and tough on terrorism. This legislation helps us to do that. We cannot ever afford to be ambiguous about this issue and we must root it out wherever it is, particularly in the context of the new threats from international terrorism. I fully support this legislation but I would like to see more effective action from the Government in dealing with the potential threats to our nation from Sellafield and from the transport of nuclear materials.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Like the previous speaker, I too support this legislation. The events of 11 September 2001 probably changed the world and people now have a different attitude to terrorists. America and Iraq are on the eve of war. Any right-minded person would say Saddam Hussein is probably one of the most evil people in the world. It is sad the American people, army and Government  cannot deal with him and the people that support him and keep him in power. It is a pity that the innocent people in Iraq will pay the price and are already doing so. Their sons and daughters will be the ones to die and Saddam will be the last one they will get – they failed the last time. I hope there will be no war and he can be dethroned by the people of Iraq rising up and taking him out.This legislation does not mention negotiating with terrorists or criminals. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, introduced this Bill to the Dáil yesterday. Along with everybody in the country, I was disappointed at the events of last week where two young people were kidnapped. People were defying the State and the Garda Síochána and worrying the people in Limerick and the rest of the country. A Minister who sits on the opposite side wanted to negotiate with these people. What kind of message is sent out to our young people, to the terrorists and to Europe when a democratically elected representative of this House and Government Minister was prepared to negotiate with people who I believe to be terrorists? They are creating fear by defying the law and order in this country and I was outraged. I was in Limerick over the weekend and the people there were outraged as are the people throughout the country. There should be no dealing with terrorists.I support this legislation because I believe in law and order. I believe that law and order in this country has broken down. We used to listen to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, the great zero tolerance man. He has now gone to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and that is a better place for him. That is called the ministry for fun and frolics. He certainly did nothing for law and order in this country. His record speaks for itself. He might have been good at bringing legislation through the House, but legislation is only useful if the resources of the State are then given. Considering what has happened at Shannon, I am surprised that the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, has not resigned today. This is not because he is not doing a good job, but because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform failed to give him the resources to protect Shannon Airport. Is it not a sad reflection on this country that we received such bad publicity?People have a right to protest. Students and building workers, who protested outside the House today, have every right to do so, as do the protesters in Shannon. However, the latter do not have the right to damage public property or take on the State, which is what they have done. We are sending out a message to the world that our Army is being deployed to protect a small airport. There was no need to send the Army to Shannon Airport. With the necessary resources and support, the Garda Síochána would be well able to protect the airport. They have not been given either.I question the Minister's decision not to chastise the Minister of State in his Department, Deputy O'Dea. I also ask the reason the Garda Commissioner did not ask the Minister for the resources needed to protect the State last week. He should have informed the Minister that he did not have adequate resources in Limerick or at Shannon Airport and warned him he would be forced to take the honourable course of action if such resources were not provided.There is no point introducing legislation on terrorism. We have no shortage of legislation and more is emanating from Europe. As a supporter of law and order, I believe in the aims of this legislation. Terrorists must be targeted and taken out. We see people here driving Mercedes cars and collecting social welfare every Thursday who have no visible means. The State should be investigating the sources of this money and whether the people in question are involved in drugs, gun running or other criminal activities. If that is found to be the case, they should be targeted by the CAB and the full resources of the State.We need to be careful in how we define a terrorist. The students protesting outside today are not terrorists, but young people concerned about the future. We do not want the legislation to be abused in such a way that innocent people are targeted. This will not happen. I compliment all our previous Ministers for Justice on how they approached terrorist attacks and bombings here. This House united when there was an attack, regardless of its origins.There are still some people who do not believe in the peace process. They should be investigated by the CAB and other agencies to ascertain the extent of their resources and money, whether they are obeying the laws of the land or are involved in criminal activity and taken out. The Government would have my full support in this.I extend my sympathy to the American people following the events in Texas last week when the space shuttle was lost. The world has become a more dangerous place since 11 September 2001 when 20 to 25 people were able to take over aeroplanes and kill thousands of people. They had few weapons and no big guns, tanks or bombs, but they planned the attacks well and created havoc in America and the world. It is very difficult to deal with a terrorist with a bomb in a suitcase who wants to place it on O'Connell Street or a London street and walk away. The resources of the State should be used to target such people and put them out of business. The Government of the day and its agencies, namely, the police force, should have legislation available to them which would allow them to approach the courts if they have information that a person is involved in terrorist activity and plans to attack Britain, America or this country.We need to be careful as there are two kinds of terrorist. Terrorists are not motivated to any great extent by political beliefs. Rather, they believe in pounds, shillings and pence. We see  this in Northern Ireland and in this city. Drugs and control of taxis and finance are what is at stake. If they get in each other's way, they shoot each other for the sake of control. They must be dealt with, regardless of whether they are Unionists or Nationalists.We must stop the daily carnage in this city where people enter pubs, ask patrons to step aside and shoot their victims. The message sent out from this House and this country last week, which was not taken up by the media because the Minister of State in question, Deputy O'Dea, is a media darling and journalist – a half journalist, half politician, if either – should have been condemned by the Taoiseach, a man who never condemns anything, and the Minister, another media darling. We have listened to his promise yet he is doing very little, which is reminiscent of the Fianna Fáil Party slogan, "A Lot Done, More to Do". People expect and await action.There is another group in society which should be included in the definition of terrorists, namely, joyriders. Joyriding is not the appropriate description of the events on the night the family of Garda Padden, a constituent of mine, was notified of his death. He was killed by terrorists, which is what joyriders are and they should be treated as such. Law and order is breaking down and if the State cannot deal with that problem, how will it deal with outsiders who wish to enter the country and attack it or use it as a base for supporting Iraq?

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I welcome the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 and commend the Minister for introducing it. His detailed contribution will have allayed many fears and explained the background to the Bill and the thinking behind its various provisions. I was struck in his introduction by the six instances of terrorism which have occurred in the brief 17 month or 18 month period since 11 September. Many of us would have had difficulty in listing or recollecting these actions. The Bali bombing is one which quickly comes to mind, but there were others. Fortunately, one was thwarted by the apprehension of the shoe bomber, who has now been tried and found guilty. This list amounts to a significant number of international terrorist acts in a very short period.We should be encouraged by the success in apprehending the shoe bomber, as it proves that effective action can be taken against terrorism and that it is sometimes possible to prevent such outrages. On occasion, we are guilty of throwing up our hands in horror and half believing nothing can be done, which is not an option. I am glad  the legislation brings action and clarity and I hope it will be acted on at international level.I welcome the fact that there is an element of European Union input in the legislation. I am not one of those who believe that the EU should be kept in the background. It has a positive role to play in international affairs and we have a substantial role to play in the European Union and the United Nations. We are sometimes guilty of overlooking the potential role we can play in Europe and the potential role the EU can play in the context of international terrorism and foreign affairs in general. I welcome the fact that there is at least some input from the European Union in this instance.Many people here would say the murder of Veronica Guerin was a turning point in that a great deal of legislation was passed and bodies set up which had an immediate and dramatic impact on the level of crime here. People tend to say the same is true of the events of 11 September but apart from anything else, the six examples the Minister gave of major international terrorist acts in the interim period gives the lie to that assertion. While 11 September begets this legislation, most people would accept that very little progress has been made against international terrorism in recent years, and even less before that.I risk sharing Deputy Costello's concerns regarding some of the definitions in the Bill. I might come from a slightly different perspective in terms of some of them, but it appears that because of the origin of the legislation, a number of the definitions appear to be entirely untrained in the legal area and sit poorly with the Irish law with which I am familiar. I anticipate difficulty down the line in interpreting some of these legislative measures should we ever be faced with the unfortunate situation where they are tested in a courtroom. If that were so, it would be a considerable weakness in the legislation.I must differ with Deputy Costello in relation to Shannon. He may have given the impression that he thought it was in Limerick, which it is not. To be fair, he did not quite say that but it came in the same context—

It would be impossible to deal with these legislative measures this week without referring to the acts of criminal damage on the US airline and on personnel defending it.Like most Members, I welcome the exclusion from the offences schedule of those seeking change in society and engaging in legitimate protests. That has to be the case but I would not like that exclusion to become a safeguard or an escape route for those who would engage in criminal activity, whether against property or individuals, under cover of such protests. That is not acceptable. Those of us who are elected in a democracy have an obligation and a duty to make clear our opposition to such acts of violence. I am disap pointed that some people in this House were not prepared to do that. Like virtually everybody here, I have engaged in protests on numerous occasions over the years. I remember engaging in a protest similar to the one outside the gate today, although it was some time ago. I also remember protesting on the streets of Limerick after Bloody Sunday and engaging in many other protests to do with local issues. It is hugely important that citizens in a democracy should have that right and that that right be defended but I would not make it a right without limits or one which makes every activity acceptable. In particular I have in mind some of the actions in Shannon during the week. It is fair to say in that context that the effects of the protest in Shannon have been far-reaching economically, but that is an issue for a different debate. It is well to bear in mind, however, that World Airways is an important customer in the airport and it is ironic that it has chosen to transfer its business to Frankfurt. We would be of the view here that Germany is strongly opposed to the war, yet that is where the business has gone.There are a number of exclusions, or non-inclusions, in the definitions in section 6 in particular and also in sections 10 and 11. Section 6 lists a number of actions, individuals and so on and one of those refers to acts committed on an aircraft registered in the State. I am aware that arises from international and European legislation to some extent, but the legislation would be more far-reaching and encompassing if it included, for example, airlines which began their journeys in the State or were intended to arrive in the State. One would hope they would arrive safely but when a plane came down over Scotland, legal complications arose in terms of pursuing those who were believed to be responsible for causing that crash. It would be a pity if what is far-reaching legislation were to have exceptions such as that. It is stated further on in the Bill that we will be required to take jurisdiction where a request for extradition is made and refused. One would tend to assume that in these instances a request for extradition would be made and either granted or refused. Circumstances might arise where such requests would not be made and if that were the case, it would be a pity to leave open such a loophole. I welcome section 6(5) in particular but these lists also arise in sections 10 and 11. I suspect they have been included because of a need for conformity and uniformity with the other jurisdictions but it would be a pity if people were able to avail of the exclusions.Many of the issues that arise from 11 September are within the remit of the United Nations and the Security Council passed Resolutions 1368 and 1441 with which we are very familiar. Security Council Resolution 1373 which requires states to take a range of measures to combat the financing of terrorism, provides for freezing funds and seizure of financial assets and mirrors the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. That is a substantial step forward because one of the main difficulties  has been to find the means to address the financing of some of these organisations.The Bill is very important in providing this State with a body of law to deal with international terrorism. I sincerely hope other countries are sufficiently on board to make sure that it works. There is considerable evidence of close links between drug traffickers and terrorist groups, both on this island and internationally. Section 32 makes certain requirements of the banks and financial institutions.I note that the provisions of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act will be applied to terrorist financing under this measure but I am concerned there has been limited success in this jurisdiction arising from the 1994 Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in that it appears to be possible for many of these people, usually gentlemen, to hide out in not too distant places such as Spain or Holland and keep the proceeds of their crimes. That is not easy to do in this country but they appear to be able to transfer them to those countries successfully. This Bill does not provide specifically for that but I would welcome a move on the international front which would facilitate more active dealings with drug traffickers and crime bosses on an international stage.

It also arises from the European Union Council framework decision taken on 13 June 2002, and that framework decision is exhibited as part of the Bill.The Bill correctly seeks to do two things. First, it is incorporating a series of conventions dealing with terrorism into Irish law. These include the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.There are many provisions in the Bill which give powers to the authorities similar to those of the Criminal Assets Bureau to freeze and seize funds and so on. Those provisions are welcome but the Bill does something else which is also important. It seeks to define acts of terrorism and terrorism as a new crime in itself. The language in the Bill mirrors the language of the framework decision in large part but it then goes a little further, unfortunately. The framework decision includes a specific list of acts, from (a) to (i), which are enumerated as terrorist acts. In our transposing legislation there is a list of offences under Irish law in the Schedule which, combined with the political element, are made into terrorist acts. I have taken the advice of the legal adviser to the Oireachtas and, as I understand it, some of the acts perpetrated at Shannon – attacking an  aeroplane, for example – would be defined as terrorist acts under this Bill. That is a mistake.

The danger is that if one describes something like that as an act of terrorism, when a real act of terrorism occurs one has devalued the language regarding terrorism. I took the trouble of looking up the definition of terrorism in the Oxford Dictionary, which states: "The systematic employment of violence and intimidation to coerce a Government or community."  A terrorist is defined as: "Someone who uses and favours violent and intimidating methods of coercing a Government or community."  I found the acts at Shannon quite repulsive but I was equally shocked by the fact that Deputies Sargent and Gormley condoned those acts, which was absolutely disgraceful. However, those acts were not acts of terrorism. I read the Minister's Second Stage speech carefully and he appeared open to the possible amending and tightening of this definition on Committee Stage.Apart from that this is a good Bill. The correct Acts are listed in the Schedule but if one goes through the definition section, section 6, it could in certain circumstances have the effect of designating a non-terrorist engaged in perhaps minor destruction of property as engaged in a terrorist act. For example, section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 is mentioned in the Second Schedule. It states:A person who without lawful excuse damages any property belonging to another, intending any damage to any such property or being reckless as to where any such property would be damaged shall be guilty of an offence.I note what the Minister is trying to do but by changing the language and structure of the framework document somewhat by trying to define this, he has made the definition too wide. One cannot fully define an act of terrorism. One will not find any definition that will take into account each and every act. The framework decision gave a list of examples of that kind of behaviour and deciding whether or not someone has committed an act of terrorism is going to have to be a matter for judicial decision. It will be impossible for us as legislators to create a definition of terrorism. There will have to be guidelines and parameters in legislation and it will then be a matter for judicial decision in each case. Subject to that health warning, I warmly welcome the Bill. It is well-structured by and large but the definition section is simply too wide. Dealing with terrorism one must always balance the need for human rights, liberty and freedom of expression with the freedom of the State. If the definition is too wide  it will have the effect of letting real terrorists off the hook when they commit atrocities.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	367	No Member has more respect for law and order than me. Law and order is a matter of social justice, not something for reactionaries. I do not believe in the "hang 'em and flog 'em" brigade. Law and order is a matter of social justice because if we do not have law and order those who suffer most are the most vulnerable – the elderly, women who cannot walk home at night and children who cannot be sent to the corner shop because they would have to run a gauntlet of those who want to attack them. Young men in particular are also suffering from street violence.I am strong on law and order but I am concerned that year after year we are passing laws and we seem to have all law and no order. Every time something happens those enforcing the law and others come looking for more powers. We are giving them more and more powers but care needs to be taken in the Oireachtas that we do not upset the fine balance between civil liberty and the need to contain threats to law and order. If we looked at the list of laws we have passed in the last ten years we would find that some of them have been draconian but no matter how strong the law is, it seems order does not prevail. We are told nothing can be done about people loitering on the street yet the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act was specifically passed to deal with that. This Bill should be monitored carefully. When replying to the debate the Minister should tell the House how many criminal justice Bills we have passed in the last ten years, as it is quite a number.It is possible for the Garda, without reference to anyone, to go to the telephone company and get details of calls made by our citizens with no court order. We ensure great protection of our citizens by providing a very tight procedure, overseen by a High Court judge, before allowing telephones to be tapped. However, if anyone wants to know who the journalists covering these proceedings have spoken to then one only needs a friendly garda to go into the telephone company and say he or she is investigating some matter. He can then get access to one's telephone account.The numbers dialled and calls received will be available without the telephone user ever knowing, without the supervision of any judge and without a warrant or any other form of accountability. That is an extraordinary power for a garda to have. There should be supervision of that power, it should be overseen in the same way and by the same judge as would be the case with phone tapping. There are dangers inherent in this. I have no evidence but I suspect very strongly that this area has been abused. We all know when people are given powers without accountability, those powers can be used in a way that was never intended.The contents of this Bill run to the heart of some of the considerations of the Convention on  the Future of Europe. The Acting Chairman and others have reported to the Committee on European Affairs on the detailed work of the convention, and I pay tribute to him and his colleagues for the amount of time he is putting into that work. The EU committee chaired by Commissioner Barnier has recommended improved, structured co-operation to combat terrorism and recommends such co-operation should have full treaty effect. A proposal will be put to the convention for further debate of the matter and will work its way into the Intergovernmental Conference and the resultant treaty.If we are serious about combating terrorism, are we right to confine ourselves to only non-state terrorism? The Barnier document appears at first reading to address itself to terrorism by any entity other than a state. Does that go far enough in this day and age? There are rogue states that sponsor terrorism.We are the least defended and, therefore, the least secure state in Europe. This worries me and the House must turn its attention to that fact. Recently an Irish registered Ryanair flight was to take off from Stockholm and there was an attempt to hijack it. The would-be hijacker was arrested, however, and the flight was able to proceed. If that flight had been hijacked on its way to Britain, I presume the hijacking would not have taken place until the plane was about to descend. It could then have been diverted into Irish airspace or via Irish airspace into Sellafield with all the resultant implications for us. If we had two hours notice of that, we would not have the capacity to deal with it, or any similar act of terrorism. All this talk of legislation is no good on its own unless we have some way to deal with acts of terrorism on a grand scale.Unlike other neutral countries in the EU, we have not equipped the Defence Forces to provide security and we are not members of any alliance, unlike Northern Ireland which has been a member of NATO since 1949. I am deeply concerned about this. It is an issue the Government and the House should address in a proactive manner. Legislation on its own is useless because we are wide open to attack and everyone knows it. If anyone wanted to retaliate for the use of Shannon Airport there is very little the State could do about it. We cannot have it both ways, we should either join an alliance or equip the Defence Forces with the means necessary to defend and secure the State against terrorism, which legislation on its own cannot do.My preferred choice would be to take the Barnier document, which hints at a little more because it uses the word "armed" in the relevant clause and hints at more than non-state terrorism, and proposes that the European Union should evolve into a defence alliance. If that happens, the automatic Western European Union requirement of one state to come to the defence of another could be incorporated into a new treaty as a protocol rather than a full treaty provision, thereby allowing those member states that wish  to do so not to opt in automatically but on a case by case basis.That will not come about unless we seek to bring it about. Most of the other non-neutral member states have plenty of cover through NATO and are in no hurry to bring about a European common defence. We should be in a hurry to do it. I raised the issue as a member of the reflection group when we were preparing the Amsterdam treaty. At the time there was resistance. Portugal said it was the most pro-NATO member of the EU and did not want to know about anything else. The Danes had a similar view while the Germans and Italians were indifferent. After a number of readings, however, they came around and were prepared to consider this approach. If we want a European defence and security architecture that suits our needs, we must be one of the architects. We are keeping our heads down and reacting to the proposals of others.The proposals of the convention to deal with terrorism do not go far enough. Legislation will not give us the cover we require. I would welcome the opportunity to have a broader debate, including on the issue of neutrality, if the House wishes. It might be extraneous in terms of this Bill, but we are missing an opportunity to address the question of both state and non-state terrorism. What is an act of war or aggression but state terrorism? We must be mature and debate these issues.In times past, we could not criticise the sacred cows of the Catholic Church and the GAA. Now they are kicked in the groin at every opportunity. There are similar issues which we still cannot maturely discuss. We cannot discuss security and defence issues in this House. NATO is bandied around like a dirty four letter word, with no respect for the fact that our neighbours in Northern Ireland have been members since 1949. The people who live in Strabane are no less moral than those living in Lifford but the people living in Strabane have much greater provision for their long-term security and defence.I am worried for my children because we have left them vulnerable and no law will deal with that. This is all law and no order. The first duty of the Government and of Parliament is to provide for the security of the citizens of the State and we are failing to do so. We are making the rules without providing for the means to implement those rules and that is folly. It is folly to pass one such Bill after another without making the necessary provisions to secure the security of the State and to ensure that the laws we enact can be passed.Now that the Human Rights Commission has been set up in the Republic under the chairmanship of former Senator, Maurice Manning, which was an inspired and generous choice by the Government given that he was a Fine Gael Senator, this type of legislation should be monitored by that body. We should not await its judgment, but require it  to monitor such legislation and to report to the relevant committee of the Dáil and Seanad at least annually on the workings of this legislation to see if it is effective, if it needs to be strengthened or if its provisions are being misused or abused. We should ensure that adequate facilities are built into the legislation to ensure examination and independent assessments and reports to the Oireachtas.

We regard many of its measures as totally incompatible with civil rights, particularly the right to protest peacefully, about which we have spoken at length in the House recently, and to engage in civil disobedience in pursuit of political beliefs. The Bill widens the definition of terrorism to include a range of offences under a raft of legislation. The definition of terrorist activity in section 4 includes an act committed with the intention of "unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act". I wonder about that definition of terrorism. It could be argued that every patriot who fought for Irish freedom and who resisted British rule by peaceful means or in arms was engaged in terrorist activity. The use of the term "terror", as we recall, goes back in Ireland to the 1920s when it was most applied to British state forces, that is, the Black and Tans and subsequently the Auxiliaries. Yet under this Bill the actions of state forces are effectively excluded from the definition of terrorist activity.The campaign of the civil rights movement in the North of Ireland in the 1960s was terrorist activity under the definition offered, as were a range of offences which courts in this jurisdiction deemed political during the 1970s and 1980s and, as a result, refused to extradite many people to the Six Counties or to Britain. Under this Bill the last remaining vestiges of the already much diminished political exception in extradition cases will be removed. Let us also look at the global situation and not only the historical one in Ireland. If this legislation had been in force at the time of apartheid in South Africa or British rule in India, the State would have had to extradite Nelson Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi if the circumstances had arisen.The Government is in breach of its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement in pursuing this legislation. In that Agreement the Government committed itself to undertake a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the  State Acts. A review was carried out, but it was not wide-ranging. There was minimal public consultation and there was not any public hearing. There has not been an Oireachtas debate on the report, which was strikingly conservative. That should not surprise us, particularly when one recalls that the majority of the review committee could not bring themselves to recommend that the power to intern without trial should be repealed. Many of the sound arguments against the Offences Against the State Acts and, by extension, against this Bill which reinforces those Acts, will be found in the dissenting minority report of that committee, which is important and should be essential reading for all Deputies in determining their stance on this proposed legislation. Instead of strengthening civil rights, as promised under the Good Friday Agreement, this Bill undermines them.One year ago Human Rights Watch warned that legislative measures introduced post 11 September were threatening long held human rights principles and "inspiring opportunistic attacks on civil liberties". Amnesty International has also expressed deep concern that national security has become the predominant concern of Governments at the expense of human rights. Amnesty International has urged all states to ensure that any measures are in compliance with human rights obligations. Both organisations have criticised the evolving United Nations comprehensive treaty on international terrorism on the grounds that it could do serious damage to human rights protection by undermining freedom of expression, the laws of war and refugee protections and by creating a loophole which allows the military to commit acts of terrorism in peace time.Human Rights Watch has criticised the EU definition of terrorism as being overly broad and as threatening freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. Let the record reflect that Sinn Féin shares those concerns and I hope that is reflected by many Deputies in the House. The House is now being required by European framework directive or decision to jump on what I can only regard as a regressive bandwagon to roll back on liberties which Republicans and others have fought and died for since the 18th century. For that reason, the matter before the House today could not be more grave.The Government is rushing this Bill because it knows it will not withstand close public scrutiny. It is important that there is public scrutiny of what is being proposed. Sinn Féin has many problems with many aspects of the Bill. Unfortunately, time prevents me from listing them all so I will focus my remarks on the core of the Bill, which is also the core of our objectives, namely, Part 2, sections 4 to 6. Part 2 seeks to establish a common definition of terrorist offences to be adopted for the purpose of harmonising prosecutions within the European Union. Yet successive international resolutions, conventions and  protocols on terrorism have failed to define it since the League of Nations first attempted to do so as far back as 1937, the year of our Constitution. Even today there is not any internationally accepted definition. There is a good reason for that. It is because the definition is generally subjective and politically loaded. Even the Minister must acknowledge that.

The UN policy working group on terrorism has cautioned that labelling political opponents or adversaries as terrorists – I have heard it said once or twice in my political years – is "a time tested technique to delegitimise and demonise them". The predecessors of every party in this House, with the possible exception of the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party, were so labelled by the British Government. However, I have noticed in this House in recent days that the Government is seeking to so label the Green Party.As regards the definition conundrum, most experts, including the UN working group, agree that targeting civilians, whether randomly or selectively, for the purpose of generating fear are the two essential elements which separate terrorism from other forms of political violence. The mere facts of political objectives, violent action or destruction of property are not sufficient for the purposes of the definition. However, the definition in both the EU framework directive and the Bill sets the threshold dangerously low. In section 4 of the Bill a terrorist act is merely "an act as defined in Part 1 of Schedule 2, undertaken with intent to compel a government or international organisation". There is no requirement for such an action to be violent, target civilians or seek to instil fear, yet the attempt to persuade or pressure a government to perform or abstain from performing an act is what political protest is all about. We have seen this demonstrated today on the streets outside Leinster House in the legitimate protest by the Union of Students in Ireland seeking to do exactly what the Bill could actually prohibit. This is at the very core of what is wrong in the Bill. It threatens the fundamental right of peaceful protest within a democracy to persuade or dissuade.

To compound the definitional difficulties created in sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, section 6 reverses the burden of proof, allowing for a presumption of guilt in relation to intent and putting the onus on the defendant. Since intent is the substance of the  offence and the rationale for the increased penalties attached under section 7, defendants will be guilty of terrorism under the Bill unless they can prove otherwise. Undoubtedly, it is such provisions that have caused human rights and civil liberties groups to sound the alarm.I had intended to make some further points but, in deference to other speakers, I will conclude by reiterating my dissent.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The times in which we live have made the very word "terrorism" a trigger of fear and oppression. The need to legislate properly for the risks posed by terrorist activities is not doubted. The several international conventions which we seek to combine in this Bill undoubtedly need an Irish legislative response. However, in speaking of terrorism in its wider sense, I caution against narrowly defining terrorism. The atrocities listed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in opening this debate are undoubtedly terrorist activities by secretive organisations intent on undermining societies, governments and ways of life. Those organisations are peopled at the higher echelons by persons intent on undermining, through evil means, much of what we hold dear in this world. However, their ability to attract and recruit into their organisations is born out of the type of economic and social injustice which exists throughout the world. It is to be expected that, in formulating a Government response to terrorism, we should use whatever influence we have, as a small nation, to speak also of a decommissioning of hearts and minds and the situations from which terrorism is created.Ultimately, any recourse to violence in whatever form – I wish to be quite categorical – whether it is an act resulting in damage to property or injury and loss of human life, is an admission of defeat by those who carry out such activities. However misguided or misinformed, it is born out of circumstances caused sometimes by frustration but always by failure to follow the right approach to secure political solutions and the betterment of society. I am concerned about the very narrow focus of the Bill because it compromises civil liberties in a number of ways, thereby admitting defeat by those who undertake terrorist activities in society. When we restrict our freedom to congregate, assemble and speak out as we see fit, we have already lost the battle in a war concerning the type of society and democracy we seek to have.The wider debate on terrorism also has to address the very real threat of state terrorism where it exists and helps to foster the obscene and evil form of terrorism to which the Minister referred so eloquently. In the international climate in which this debate takes place there is no doubt that Mr. Saddam Hussein and his Ba'ath Party constitute a terrorist regime which denies proper freedom of expression to its people and, when considered necessary, has killed and oppressed many of them. We need to consider  whether the best way of dealing with such a tyrannical regime is to engage in the practice of terrorism. Like many Irish people, I fear there is a headlong rush to the use of the weapons of war and terrorism to bring about a desired end. Morally, I do not see any distinction between a car bomb in Enniskillen and a cruise missile in Basra if the intent is to kill innocent people to bring about a desired political end. We must be consistent in those principles if we believe in true democracy and the moral basis for it. The debate on the Bill needs to take account of the fact that terrorism is narrowly defined.In relation to the EU framework directive, my party believes it is as much inspired by the widespread protests against the WTO and G8 in places such as Genoa and Gothenburg as by the real revulsion arising from the events of 11 September 2001. We should avoid that impulse in formulating and enacting the Bill.

However, when I had finished reading it, I was left with a vague sense of unease, although I understand the need for the legislation and support the overall thrust of the action being taken. The Bill is a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001 and it is critically important to ensure we get it right.Why do I feel a sense of unease? In broad terms, it is very important not to devalue very necessary anti-terrorism legislation by broadening it to the point that it becomes questionable. There is always a certain tension between the need for measures and legislation to destroy terrorist networks and their sources of funding while, at the same time, protecting individual freedoms from the all-powerful arm of the state.The introduction to the Bill states its purpose as to give effect to the framework decision in combating terrorism adopted by the EU Council on 13 June 2002. The framework decision is binding on Ireland as to the result to be achieved but the form and methods we use to achieve this result are at our own discretion. We have the freedom, therefore, to frame the Bill in such a way as to reflect our own values.On section 4, which deals with the definition of terrorist activity and terrorist linked activity, I have just one or two observations. Part of the definition of terrorist activity is "an offence committed with the intent of unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform, or abstain from performing, any act". Do we have a list of these international organisations? Who or what are we speaking about? It is important that the legislation would be more specific.Also in this section, terrorist activity is further defined as seriously destabilising the economic structures of a state or international organisation.  It seems to me that the legislation is not only about protecting people's lives and protecting states from serious destabilisation, but also encompasses economic losses to states or international organisations.Furthermore the explanatory memorandum states that section 6(6) provides for certain specified circumstances which a court may take into account. These are whether the act caused or was likely to result in major economic loss. Could an attack on a US military plane at Shannon, resulting in damage of €0.5 million or €1 million, come under this category? I heard Deputy Mulcahy refer to this earlier. While I do not approve of the actions at Shannon, at the same time I do not consider them terrorist offences. Would this legislation make it such?This is a major part of my unease with this broad legislation. It includes not only governments and international organisations, but also internationally protected persons. For example, it rightly includes their person and their liberty, but could it possibly include a custard pie flung into the face of the ambassador of Iraq or UK—

It also talks about the property of internationally protected persons. In my opinion, that is probably stretching the elastic too far.The Second Schedule lists offences for purposes of definitions of terrorist activity and terrorist-linked activity. It rightly lists murder, manslaughter and rape but, under 2(f), it lists endangering traffic. While I did not drive a tractor two weeks ago, I certainly recall being involved in cheering the farmers tractorcade and supporting their cause. How far are we going with this legislation? Surely that cannot be defined as terrorist activity.I note there is no mention of state terrorism or terrorism promoted by states. I have no problem with the section on hostage-taking and the section which seeks to suppress the financing of terrorism, but what about the arms dealers and the democratic countries who sell arms to different regimes and who profit from these transactions? Prior to the invasion of Kuwait many Western democracies supplied arms to Saddam Hussein and he oppressed his own people with these arms, but once he invaded Kuwait we changed our tune – he is now a terrorist and a dictator. I agree he is, but he was before the invasion of Kuwait. Legislation serious about defeating terrorism, which I believe is necessary, must look at all the parties involved.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I wish to share my time with Deputy Naughten.There are many aspects of this Bill with which I agree. We have no shortage of terror or terrorist associated offences in this country. This is the first opportunity I have had to address the House in the presence of the Minister for Justice,  Equality and Law Reform. He will have to get his act together much more quickly. The events in Limerick and at Shannon Airport, as portrayed throughout the world, are a disgrace to this country. If the Government of which he is a member cannot rise to occasions like that, he will set an image for this country that we certainly do not want. I do not know into what category one would put a protester with a hatchet who did the sort of damage that woman did to an aircraft, irrespective of who owned it, but it would fall into some category, either at the higher or lower end of the scale. After all the talk, what makes the case much more difficult to understand for the ordinary punter in Ireland is how a person could get onto the tarmac to do that damage in Shannon. There were several other instances since which were brought up in the Dáil today.If we talk about security, surely it is the confidence that our people have in the system which is all important. This is not the first time this has happened. There were breakdowns long before Deputy McDowell got the job. Given the level of interest in this matter at this particular time, however, it was outrageous conduct by both the Minister and the Government that they were not able to foresee that this was likely to happen.It is true that since 11 September we see the issue of terrorism in a different light. The world has become more violent. I now see the issue on the basis that there are terrorists all over the world who are prepared to do anything. They are prepared to commit acts which we could not even contemplate five years ago. That being the case, the forces of law and order everywhere will have to come together in a network in a way which minimises the risk because what happens in one nation today can easily happen in another tomorrow.I support this legislation in so far as it is our involvement with that great overall jigsaw which is tasked with the prevention of terrorism world-wide and at European level. There is a case for nuances as regards how far to go, etc., but I am surprised at the number of Deputies who find great problems with what is being proposed.I realise there will always be a need for checks and balances. That is extremely important in a democracy like ours. However, sometimes when I hear about civil liberties, I ask the following questions. What civil liberties had the people who went to work that terrible day of 11 September? What civil liberties have the victims of hijackings which disrupt flights on which people go about their normal duties around the world? For instance, what civil liberties have people who are on a plane blown up in mid-air or who are held hostage by gangsters like those involved in the Moscow theatre debacle?There has been a rise in the level of violence, the level of deviousness and cunning and the level of organisation of these activities. If the forces of law and order are not in step with or ahead of those organisations, obviously we will be submerged. It is against that background that I give  the benefit of the doubt to the Minister as to what he is trying to do.There are a number of matters which have arisen which are connected, albeit loosely, with this Bill, which is a cornerstone. I have heard a large number of people, in the past week or two in particular, raise question marks over the ability of the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities. When the United Nations decides on a certain course of action in a given situation, because of the democracies involved and because of the democratic nature of the United Nations and the objectives and principles for which it stands, I would have thought in the interests of every state and every citizen of every state that we should back it. I hear people saying they do not like what the United Nations is doing. There is nothing to stop people saying that and there were many occasions over the years where I thought that it had lost its teeth. There were times, in Yugoslavia and in other places, where one would have thought that the United Nations had no more strength on the ground than the Society of St. Vincent de Paul might have had in the same situation.When one thinks of the United Nations charter of rights and all that goes with it, one would imagine that it is in our best interests, particularly as a small country, to see the United Nations flag as being extremely important in so far as this Bill and control of terrorism world-wide are concerned. Many people are inclined to say, with regard to the possible war with Iraq, that they are against it, regardless of whether the United Nations sanctions it. It is difficult to understand that if we subscribe to the principles and objectives of the United Nations. It is difficult to know where people stand when they are totally against what the United Nations has done or is trying to do.Civil rights and liberties are extremely important in a democracy. The Minister said yesterday:The Bill does not make it an offence to seek change, nor does it make it an offence to have a cause. We value the right to espouse causes in our society and the Government will continue to defend that right, including the right of persons to espouse causes and views with which the Government itself may disagree.It would be outrageous to believe that this Bill would impinge on what the students of Ireland did today, what the farmers did last week or what the taxi drivers did the week before. Unless I am reading the Bill incorrectly, I cannot see any connection with those rights. If there was even a slight chance that this Bill would eventually mean that the right to congregate for a cause was called into question, I would not support it. However, I do not believe the Minister has that in mind. I sincerely hope that is the case.The problem we should be tackling is far broader. I am not an expert on terrorism but I have always found that behind all types of terror ism one will inevitably discover money to be the root cause. It is an extortion racket of some description. That is the reason there should be a more integrated and concerted connection between the police forces of all countries, along the lines of the Criminal Assets Bureau in this country, to deal with money laundering and the other things criminals and terrorists do for money. If they could be beaten at their own game, it would be the surest way of stopping the atrocities.We have to be realistic enough to know that it is not possible to stamp it out altogether but we should at least give the law enforcement agencies in various countries the type of flexibility that will allow them to deal with this terrorism at the level at which it operates. We are not talking about catapults; we are talking about a huge wave of terrorism organised by people who will stop at nothing. These people make fortunes out of this activity. They are the armchair generals and often the people who get shot or blown up are not the people who devised the action. Ultimately, however, unless we keep ahead of the posse, as this Bill seeks to achieve, we will be in serious trouble.I wish to return to the right of people to congregate on behalf of good causes. It would be wise of the Minister to make abundantly clear what type of terrorist activities this Bill applies to and, in so far as he can, give broad definitions of the activities to which it will not apply. There has always been a belief in this country, which I share, that it is most important to have a counterbalance to the laws of the land in the sense that, in a democracy like ours, people are entitled to demonstrate and clearly indicate that they are not happy with something that is happening in their lives or in their environment. I would not accept, under any circumstances, any retraction of the rights we enjoy in this country in that regard. That is most important.The Minister will have no trouble from me in so far as the main objectives of the Bill are concerned. I want to see international and domestic terrorists beaten, whoever they are. Most law-abiding people want that too. We have to nail our colours to the mast on this occasion and, in so far as that is necessary, I support it. However, the Minister must outline how far this will actually apply in the context of Irish democracy as we know it.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I endorse the point made earlier by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell. We continually bring legislation before the House dealing with justice and policing matters but there seems to be a major question mark over its enforcement. It is pointless to debate and tease out legislation in this House if it is not going to be implemented. That is a major concern. The Minister has put a long list of legislative proposals before the House. We have already dealt with some, including the juvenile justice legislation.  My concern is whether this legislation will be enforced.The one positive element in this Bill is its provisions regarding the financing of terrorism. Realistically, if we are going to curb terrorism, the way to do it is by accessing the terrorists' funds and tying them down. The funds are the vehicles by which organisations like al-Qaeda carry out their terrorist attacks. This legislation is based on what happened after 11 September 2001. I welcome the structures that are being put in place, which are similar to those that apply to the Criminal Assets Bureau.The issue of Shannon has been raised on a number of occasions. It is, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs put it this morning, embarrassing that there has been such free access to an international airport like Shannon, an airport that is servicing the United States, a key target for some of these groups. If it were not for the vandalism that took place, and I do not condone it, we probably would not today have the levels of security at the airport that should have been there in the past. Organisations such as al-Qaeda have in the past had members in this country and one can be sure there are still sympathisers here. When we did not have the current level of security there was nothing to stop somebody putting a bomb on one of those planes. It could have been a passenger flight going to the United States and nothing could have been done about it. It was crazy that the Government had to wait until this week to put those measures in place.I wish to comment on the vandalism that took place at Shannon Airport. There is a fine line between what one can define as vandalism and somebody interfering with an aeroplane. Had the type of interference that took place not been detected until after the flight had taken off, lives could have been in jeopardy. That has been forgotten in this debate. By allowing people free access to interfere with planes at Shannon Airport, the lives of people on those planes are being put at risk, irrespective of their cargo. However one wishes to define it, this should be of concern to this State. We must put the resources in place to ensure that the security of our airports is guarded very closely.I move on to section 6 of the Bill, and the definition of offences committed outside the State. It will be extremely difficult to catch the people involved in any of the offences mentioned in this legislation. Wherever they are apprehended, it is imperative that they can be charged and prosecuted within that jurisdiction. Only a very limited number of offences committed outside the State can be prosecuted under this legislation. They are restricted by section 6(2), and these restrictions are repeated throughout the Bill. Take the example of people involved in hostage taking or a bombing offence in another part of the world who happen to turn up in Ireland. My concern is that they could not be prosecuted here. If an individual is charged and acquitted in another jurisdiction and happens to turn up in  Ireland – it may have been a bombing that happened on an Irish ship or aircraft – and new information is then revealed to the authorities, that should be taken into consideration when deciding whether a further prosecution is warranted. We have to deal strongly and swiftly with this problem and be quite adamant that people involved in terrorist activities are subjected to the full force of law and that the law will be enforced regardless of where the offences took place. Terrorists have thrived on the fact that they can commit an offence in one part of the world and then reside for the rest of their time in another jurisdiction where they cannot be prosecuted.Part 4 of the Bill deals with the suppression of the financing of terrorism. This legislation ties in with the Criminal Justice Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Is similar legislation in force in the United States? The difficulty we have had in this country for a long time relates to the funding of terrorist activities on this island by sources in the United States. The United States has turned a blind eye to that funding in the past. It is all very well introducing this legislation here, but the difficulties we have experienced in the not too distant past stemmed from the inflow of funds from abroad for the purchase of arms and bombing equipment to conduct terrorist offences in this State. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider these points before proceeding to Committee Stage with this Bill.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Contrary to what this Bill suggests, it is not always morally wrong to seek to compel a state to act or to refrain from acting. Many acts with intent to compel a Government, such as those listed in this Bill, were committed by the ANC during the apartheid years. Were it not for the actions of Nelson Mandela and the ANC, would we still have an apartheid state in South Africa? Yet Nelson Mandela would be convicted and condemned as a terrorist under this Bill.Equally, in their time, Michael Collins, Éamon de Valera and other people who struggled against the colonial occupation of this State would be convicted under the Bill. To take a current example, does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believe that the Kurdish people will liberate themselves without acts of political violence? Does he believe, in the context of what appears to be an almost certain war in Iraq, that the Kurdish people's rights will be taken into consideration? Does he believe that a Turkish Government that has allowed 101 hunger strikers to die to date has any concern for a people it suppresses? Does the Minister maintain that letters of protest to Saddam Hussein or prayers outside his presidential palace will suffice? Likewise, would the United States have been decolonised without acts of political violence such as some of those laid out in this Bill?What about East Timor? Would that state have been created without acts of violence intended to compel a Government? Surely the killing of innocent civilians is always wrong, regardless of  whether the perpetrators are al-Qaeda, suicide bombers or British paratroopers on the streets of Derry. Seeking to compel an unjust Government can often be both necessary and morally justifiable.A related problem concerns section 6. We all know that terrorist attacks can be and are undertaken not only by non-state actors but also by state actors and state-sponsored actors. Yet under section 6(4) the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict are specifically excluded from prosecution as they are dealt with under international law. How does that apply to American forces in the Middle East? As the Minister and other Deputies know well from experience close to home, it is not always agreed what constitutes an armed force or even an armed conflict.This section specifically excludes armed forces of a state in exercise of official duties, as does section 10(6) which actually exempts armed or state forces from the offence of terrorist bombing. Yet the perpetration of both state and state-sponsored terrorism is well documented. It is a scandal that this Government has decided to introduce this legislation before the International Criminal Court legislation has even been drafted. If this Bill were to become law, Part 3, section 11, on internationally protected persons could extend this protection to war criminals if they are heads of state or are on official business. I am not suggesting for one moment that this is the Government's intention, but it would be the practical effect for the duration of the period following this Bill's inevitable passage and prior to the passage of the International Criminal Court legislation into law.All of the problems that have been raised by myself and others with regard to the overly broad definition of terrorist offences obviously hinge on the question of who and what groups undertaking what kind of activities would be targeted under the wider powers and draconian measures proposed under Part 6, sections 12 to 24, on the suppression and financing of terrorism. Given the way this Bill is drafted, a very broad range of political support groups could be targeted for assets compensation. All of the problems in the smaller details of the Bill hinge on the unacceptably broad definition of terrorist offences and the exemption of state forces from the force of law for undertaking the same actions.My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, was one of only four Deputies to speak against this measure when it was last rushed before this House for rubber stamping in the form of a proposed framework decision. Today, I add my voice to his and to those few colleagues in this House who will take a principled and politically unpopular stand against this assault on civil and human rights.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Fine Gael Party broadly supports the legislation the Minister is seeking to move through the House. It tries to put into effect a Council of Europe agreement of 1995 on the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic  substances under the Vienna Convention. This Bill will put into effect a number of international instruments as part of the response to terrorism by the EU and the broader international community. As Deputy Deasy has often said, there is no point in enacting legislation to tackle terrorism or law and order issues unless the resources to back it up are made available. We have a great deal of law but no order. There is an enormous amount of legislation on the statute books. I accept this must be constantly reviewed, but making available the resources to implement and enforce it is the challenge.When one looks at the efforts made in spending enormous amounts of money in recent years, one sees there was not much accountability or efforts made to ensure the resources were targeted at the places of greatest need. Fine Gael sees targeting resources to help the Garda overcome an escalation of crime as one of the greatest needs.Everyone was appalled at events in Limerick where a small group of people, well known to the Garda Síochána, could destroy the reputation of a city and hold it to ransom. We saw housing schemes cordoned off by the Garda and people being allowed into or out of them only at the Garda's discretion. People could not travel freely through their areas because of the activities of criminals and subversives. That would have been a sad day for any community and for the reputation of any city or area. The State has to seriously consider allocating the necessary resources to tackle it.The Garda receive many calls reporting crime but those making the calls get very little back-up because there are inadequate resources to deal with it. I was disappointed to learn that the Garda overtime bill is to be cut from €69 million to €50 million in 2003. This is happening at a time of increasing lawlessness and Dublin has witnessed its highest number of murders since record keeping began. The 2,000 additional gardaí promised in the programme for Government will not be in place this year because a retrenchment must take place to pay for the sins of the previous Government. That Government increased public expenditure by 50% in two years without seeking value for money or targeting it at priority policy issues. With the cut in overtime and the failure to recruit the 2,000 gardaí it is clear law and order issues are not a Government priority. Legislation is a priority but law and order is not. Communities are uneasy about this.The use of the Army to do the Garda's job at Shannon Airport is another sad feature of the Government's attempt to deal with law and order issues. There would not have been a breach in security if gardaí were present in sufficient numbers to deal with what started out as a peaceful protest but was perhaps hijacked by others for political ends. The Army should not have had to be called in to deal with this because of inadequate resources for the Garda Síochána.It is important that we have international co-ordination on criminal matters. I read with interest the academic debate that is going on between the former leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, and the Minister regarding EU co-ordination and how it can deal with many law and order and terrorism issues and the sovereignty of these decisions. It is a very healthy debate. I hope an EU response can be put in place, particularly regarding drug trafficking and terrorism.There is a Border on this island that constantly reminds us of the need for protection against the subversion of this State from criminality. Whether it is from Nationalists or loyalists, there is a continuous fear in Border areas at times of an escalation of violence and irregular activity in the other part of our island that it will spill into this jurisdiction. This gives a constant reminder of what is was like in the bad old days of the 1970s and we do not want to revert to it. A co-ordinated response between jurisdictions is crucially important and resources must be allocated to this. I am very glad to note the co-operation between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his counterparts to ensure the Northern Ireland police authorities and the Garda have the best possible relationship and share intelligence, ensuring the protection of our citizens and our State is high on the agenda at all times.The abuse of alcohol is a growing problem in most urban areas in the country. While there might have been reasons for the extension of the opening hours of public houses, we must now accept there is a culture here that cannot deal with these changes. Some people cannot come to terms with pubs being open until 2 a.m. on weekend mornings and feel they must stay out until the pub closes rather than adopting a more responsible attitude to alcoholic beverages. An urgent review of the liquor licensing laws is necessary. The vast majority of publicans do their best to ensure there is good law and order on their premises. It is difficult for the Garda to deal with the thousands of people under the influence of alcohol that come on to the streets at all hours of the early morning. They congregate in an unruly fashion in many urban centres.The purpose of this legislation is to tackle terrorist groups in a decisive and co-ordinated way and it is worthy of support. I know the Minister makes strong statements of intent on dealing with terrorism. I wish he had more influence at Cabinet level with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to secure the resources necessary to implement some of the worthy proposals he issues from time to time. It is a mistake that we do not give that a much higher priority when there is evidence from the figures I mentioned that our society is somewhat out of control in terms of law and order issues. Issues regarding the protection of the citizen against criminality and subversion, whether on an individual basis or on the basis of the State being protected from terrorist groups on this island or out side this jurisdiction, will always be a priority for us on this side of the House.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	383	This Bill reflects a tendency that is now rampant in the countries of western Europe and the United States since the attacks in America on 11 September 2001. The fight against terrorism has become the catch cry. Under the fight against terrorism, we have a range of reactions which, for the most part, are utterly simplistic in their approach. The Government is going along with that every step of the way and continues to do so.The first sentence of the speech of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reads, "The events of 11 September 2001 represented a defining moment for the world."  In many ways they were a defining moment in the sense of shaping the history that has been recorded since then and the history currently being made under our eyes. However, there have also been other crucial defining moments, or moments which could have been chosen to be defining, which the Government and the international community chose to ignore. When an American bomb crashed into the al-Amiriyah air raid shelter in Baghdad on 13 February 1991 and slaughtered 400 innocent civilians, we could have chosen that to be a defining moment and from that allowed many other developments to flow which could have been positive for the subsequent history of humanity.What we are dealing with here is the propaganda led by the United States and aped by the Governments of country after country inside and outside the EU. If we subject the simplistic talk about the war against terror, as it is called, we can perceive the total limitations of that concept. It is designed to cover rather than to elucidate, as if terrorism was a country, an army or a fixed entity against which one could wage war, in the same way as in previous times in history countries declared war on each other. Terrorism is a method used by certain groups related to political ends which they are trying to achieve.The Socialist Party and the international movement to which we are affiliated, the Committee for Workers International, has always taken a position of resolute opposition to terror as a means of struggle to achieve political ends. In the genesis of Marxism and of the socialist movement dating back 100 to 120 years this was one of the key debates that went on in the rising movement of the organised working class and particularly of the international socialist movement.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	399	—when the new Russian state was created, the workers' and peasants' state, it was immediately assaulted by the forces of supposed democracy in the West, including Britain, all of which sought, in blood, to drown the young revolutionary state because they feared terribly for their own system, their wealth and empires. If we had on the globe one example of a workers' democracy, that was it. The drowning in blood of the young state, the horror that was implemented upon it and the decimation of the cadres of the revolution of 1917 was part of the reason Stalinism in the 1920s was able to gain control and finished off the work that was started by the Western armies intervening. That is the real history. The Minister should read it.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	402	There are fascinating biographies and histories of those who participated as opposed to the cartoon images with which the Minister seems only to be familiar.I was forced to digress as a result of interjections. To return to the Bill, Marxism for the record has always been opposed to the method of terrorism and terrorist acts by groups for many different reasons.In the early days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland sections of the left were seduced by sections of the republican movement using these methods. We were a tiny force. We stood in opposition and said that those means would result in a disaster for the working class in Northern Ireland, and that has proved to be correct, while the main culprit was the actions and the repression of the British imperial forces at that time.A secret elite, accountable to nobody but itself, cannot be substituted for the mass action by working people, the youth, trade unionists and poor people, nationally and internationally, as a means of changing structures – economic, political and social – in society.Terror attacks on civilians which are indiscriminate like the attacks on 11 September are repugnant to us. We also argued that their methods often strengthen the forces of the reaction and the right wing and, unfortunately, that is exactly what the events of 11 September have achieved.President Bush would not now be in a position, lining up and positioning hundreds of thousands of troops and the most horrific weapons of mass destruction, to launch an assault on Iraq, with many Western countries genuflecting to him, including the Irish Government, were it not for the actions of 11 September, which have given him a pretext for launching this imminent attack. It is a very thin pretext because the linking of Iraq to Al-Qaeda is nonsense, as everyone knows, and another smokescreen for the real plans of the United States Administration. It would not be in the position it is in now were it not for the propaganda value to it of the horror and slaughter of 11 September 2001.The Government, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is in step with and going along with the stampede. Instead of an analysis of the reasons we have the world we do and some people are so crazed that they believe they can perpetrate acts such as those of 11 September 2001 or others less drastic and gain a basis for support in certain parts of the globe, we have this stampede to cover up reality. That is the position.It is amazing the manner in which the Bill is formulated, especially earlier parts of it. Dealing with acts of murder and so on is already provided for in law, about which there is no question. However, the Bill introduces the act of: "unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, consti tutional, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation". The insinuation is that it is the thin end of the wedge in so far as it can be and I have no doubt will be misused and abused by states down the line. The phrase "unduly compelling a government" could mean a strike movement or a mass movement of civil disobedience such as the huge anti-poll tax campaign in Britain.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	406	No. The framework decision, the basis for the legislation, states nothing in it may be interpreted as being intended to reduce or restrict fundamental rights or freedoms such as the right to strike, freedom of assembly and association, etc. However, once something is in law, it stands on its own. In the case where a Government feels under pressure and, for certain reasons, wants to use this legislation against a social movement as opposed to a terrorist organisation, a lawyer can wave the Framework Document about as much as he or she likes but it is not enshrined in the legislation. Therefore, we are introducing new, broad ranges of activities that enter the realm of political and social protest movements. There is no denying this.I would like to compel a Government to perform or abstain from performing an act, and try to.

Regarding the phrase "seriously destabilising . . .  economic or social structures", I want to destabilise the economic structures and system dominated on a global scale by multinational corporations which cause massive problems internationally and put in place an alternative that would bring humanity forward and upward instead. It is incredible. For a Minister who once considered himself a liberal – in some senses as it was always relative—

There is the huge hypocrisy on the part of the Government in sending the Army into Shannon Airport  to protect United States warplanes which are designed to drop their payloads—

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	412	—and protect the pilots using the airport and the rest in transit, the better for them to arrive safely on the borders of Iraq in order that they can drop their payloads of bombs and munitions of mass destruction on the Iraqi people, just like the bomb dropped on the Amiriyah air shelter in 1991. The Irish Army is now part of, auxiliary to and complicit in the United States campaign for an imminent attack on Iraq.The actions of a number of people in damaging the aeroplanes in question could clearly come under this legislation. Their actions are not the way we, in the Socialist Party, seek to build the anti-war movement, a growing movement that I hope will compel the Government to pull back from facilitating the ongoing war effort. However, it does not matter whether one supports such actions. The people who did the damage are not terrorists but anti-war campaigners. However, they could be arraigned under this legislation, which is nonsensical.The Government is silent on the terror used as a matter of policy by the United States Government and the fact that it has taken unto itself the right to strike at will with no hearing, judge or jury against those it considers to be its enemies and blast them out of the sky, as it did recently in Yemen, killing six people. We do not know if one of those six was guilty of a crime but perhaps the other five were not. We know that the United States Government underwrites the actions of the Israeli defence force in organised state terror on a weekly basis against the unfortunate Palestinian community, blasting civilian communities from its helicopters because they harbour an alleged enemy of Israel, never mind that innocent women and children are obliterated in the process. Is that not terrorism? Why is the Government silent on these issues?On the question of defeating terror, why does the Government not use the resources and research available to it in this situation? Why do we not have the energy and resources that go in to drafting legislation such as this and the hyperbole about the war on terrorism and so forth? Why do we not submit to the most rigorous scrutiny the values and decisions by which western Europe and the United States annually spend hundreds of billions of euros and dollars on the creation of weapons of mass destruction? Why do we not subject to rigorous scrutiny and criticism the fact that thousands of the best scientific minds in the western world and tens of thousands of industrial workers are engaged in nothing but the creation of weapons of mass destruction? Why do we not counterpose to it that, if those resources and that genius were diverted to addressing the problems of humanity such as hunger, starvation and disease, a transformation would be brought  about in the world that would rid us of the causes of conflict that make people so crazy that they believe they can go and do horrible things? Why do we not have that type of discussion?The answer is that the Government has accepted completely the propaganda of the United States Government which is intent on sending a message to the world that no one shall stand against the US empire and its law in the form of the trade terms it wants to lay down on behalf of its multinationals with poor people for their resources, and in the form of the political structures it wants to impose on the Middle East. Our Government is complicit in this. That is quite shameful. This is just part of the general inane propaganda response to the really serious problems we face and which cause suffering for hundreds or even thousands of millions of people. It is useless. It is less than useless and I oppose it.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	413	That was a very interesting exchange of views between the Minister and my colleague on this side of the House. I do not wish to revisit that other than to mention that I would be loath to become involved in a military response unless all other options had been tried and failed.I marvel at the degree to which poor old Saddam Hussein is portrayed these days as an unfortunate and innocent victim of circumstances and, strictly speaking, he has done no wrong at any time before. He may not be a terrorist, but let us not forget that a certain European in the mid-1930s had a particular attitude to people's rights. At that time William Shirer wrote that he was not a democrat. He did not recognise democracy, but rather used it to the best of his ability and was an excellent propagandist. Saddam Hussein is not such a bad propagandist either. Shirer warned people in Europe and America that this man had an agenda that he intended to pursue and something should be done to impede him before he got too strong. At that time in the United States there was a huge non-interventionist lobby, headed to a certain extent by William Randolph Hearst, who believed Europe was defeated and not capable of getting involved in a war.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	415	Yes, Joseph Kennedy as well. For obvious reasons they swapped comics as it were. Shirer was right. He was in the midst of it at the time and recognised what was happening. He pointed out that public opinion had not been alerted to what was going on. Suddenly it was all too late and events took on a life of their own. The power of propaganda was very obvious during that era, which was lethal as is the case leading up to and during all wars. I hope we will not have a war now, but people must remember that some extraordinary things have happened in Iraq in recent times. Somebody mentioned that people would be killed. Unfortunately, if a war takes place people will be killed and we hope that  never happens. Radar stations beside schools could be bombed, which begs the question as to why they are beside schools in the first instance.I worry about another aspect of this legislation. It is trenchant legislation and we recognise the need to ensure that people can go about their business in the ordinary way without fear or hindrance and the due process and laws of respective lands should be followed. Irish citizens, wherever they may be, should be afforded and are entitled to the same protection as citizens of other nationalities in this country. I have a doubt about the ability of this State to implement this legislation. It is the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 to give effect to a number of international instruments directed against terrorism and to meet commitments entered into by the State under a number of headings, arising from UN Security Council resolutions and EU commitments previously.Of course we are committed to the UN Charter, but I wonder if the institutions of the State, of which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is part, have the ability to respond to incidents such as we have seen in recent days. People have every right to protest peacefully, but do not have the right to take the law into their own hands and decide how to set about it. I am alarmed that internationally we are being held up to ridicule. At a time when so much emphasis has been placed on the need for security at airports, all of a sudden it is possible for people to walk nonchalantly into an airport, which allegedly is a sensitive area and apparently is a high security area. However, members of the public can walk in there at any time. They can overpower the forces of law and order and do wilful damage for whatever purpose. How can we expect to be taken seriously in the international community in our efforts to enforce or implement legislation such as that before us if we are unable to do a simple job like keeping people from crossing the runway when planes are taking off?That is an issue that we as a nation and a people must examine very carefully. However, we must also examine the degree to which our image can be damaged internationally as a result of the kind of happenings we have seen in recent days. It is very fine to say we are against the war. We are all against war, just as we are in favour of all the good things in life. However, the international community views us in a particular fashion and on the basis of their conclusions they will make their own decisions and will determine the degree to which they can rely on us in the future. I do not know what the Minister thinks, but I believe that there are serious question marks over how we respond to such incidents.For many years I have been hearing how sensitive some of our installations might be in the event of a terrorist attack. If there were a terrorist attack on any of the vital sensitive installations around the country, what would happen? Would we be able to fight them off? Would we be able  to avert the possible tragedy? What would we do? I do not know. I believe we would read about it in the following morning's papers. People would probably be arrested, but only after the event. Nothing would happen beforehand.It is like the whole question of crime in the country. We have closed circuit television cameras to record the events. We can view them afterwards and see that an offence has taken place. We then prosecute and take action, but that is after the offence. It is of little consolation to the people who are the victims in those circumstances. Every day there is a shooting, stabbing or beating that is fatal. Although we have a high rate of detection afterwards, what consolation is that to the victims? How do we counter that? Is it sufficient to say we have detected and have evidence to bring people to justice? We cannot bring the dead back to life. We seem to rely too much on what happens after the event and the same applies to this legislation.Over the past few weeks, there have been a number of incidents of what is described as organised crime. How does crime become organised? Why do we allow it to become organised? Why do we have CCTV cameras taking photos of what is happening on the streets of our towns and cities? These crimes, which could be terrorist related for all we know, continue to happen, yet we can do nothing more than record them and take action after the event. Why can we not prevent these incidents instead of repeatedly responding to them?A few weeks ago, I raised the issue of our rising homicide rate, which is catching up with that of New York. This is an extraordinary development and an indictment of our system. To the best of my knowledge, the annual murder rate in New York ten years ago was about 600 and this has been reduced to a level of 84 or 85.

What is extraordinary is that the homicide rate here is catching up with a city whose population greatly exceeds the population of this country.Members mentioned the 11 September attacks, about which Americans and others are understandably sensitive. The attacks forced the US to ask serious questions and resulted in it setting out to find those it felt should be made accountable for them. If everybody was to decide to allow incidents of this nature to pass unnoticed, the perpetrators would gain strength and encouragement. Do we want action to be taken or should we limit response to making a protest? Unfortunately, great powers do not protest, they take action.The Bill includes provisions on the financing of terrorism. These will have serious international implications because there are a number of well known financiers operating in the area of terrorism. Nobody knows how they get a return for  their money, but one presumes they do, given that financiers do not do something for nothing. To what extent does the legislation overlap on the area of tackling organised crime? The financing of organised crime is widespread here. Is it envisaged that the legislation might be used to deal with this problem?I am aware we already have an extremely effective agency, the Criminal Assets Bureau. It may well be that an extension of its powers is envisaged. It is also possible that some of the activities of organised crime fall within the remit of the legislation. I ask the Minister to address this issue. The suppression of the financing of terrorism is a new approach which gets to the source of the problem by cutting off and confiscating the funds of those directly involved in providing the wherewithal to international and domestic terrorists.On the issue of the definition of terrorism, we are constantly faced with the question as to what terrorism is. What constitutes idealism and what constitutes the pursuit of nationalistic or idealistic objectives? The answer is simple. Terrorism is where a group uses innocent bystanders as targets in order to validate its cause. As innocent persons have done nothing wrong, they should not be used as an example in a war of attrition or to make a propaganda point for the perpetrators. This needs to be recognised in this country because from time to time voices raised here have found a reason for certain actions. The question is whether the victims of an action bear responsibility for the reason for which it is perpetrated. It is fundamental that the legislation recognises that the killing of innocent people congregating for whatever purpose by a group or individual in order to prove a point flies in the face of everything for which we stand.We need to be unequivocal on this as there have been such instances on this island in recent years. The one which immediately comes to mind is the Omagh bombing. I often wonder what the unfortunate people from Spain and elsewhere who were bereaved by that bomb felt about the idealism behind the act. Did they regard it as a good propaganda exercise which brought to the attention of the powers that be the need to do something? It was nothing other than a black day in the calendar which held up the wider cause of nationalism to ridicule and derision. We cannot have it both ways.I hope we in this country contribute to enforcing this stringent legislation introduced in response to 11 September and other actions which have occurred since. We cannot pass the Bill and walk away claiming we are a poor country which, unfortunately, cannot afford a proper fence around its major installations, such as airports. It is internationally recognised that airports are a sensitive area. People bring bombs on board aeroplanes and pass through small areas to plant devices on aeroplanes in transit.It has been suggested that Ireland could become a target. The likelihood of Ireland becoming a target would be strengthened if the  international community found us to be vulnerable and lacking the ability to take action. That would be an extraordinary development, which, I hope, will not occur. It is the responsibility of the Department to ensure Ireland lives up to its current international obligations and takes action on new obligations laid down in the legislation. I appeal to the Minister to ensure we do so.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I thank all the Deputies for contributing to this debate. It is not out of politeness or parliamentary good manners – far be it for me to engage in that – that I say it has been of great assistance to me to listen to this debate because the points made in relation to the Bill have been, generally speaking, constructive, objective and analytical. Even though I would not agree with much of what has been said by some people, I agree with much of what has been said by most people in the course of this debate.Looking at the text of the Bill, there are some areas which already occur to me in light of the comments that have been made here as to what we should do by way of fine-tuning the Bill to make sure it is not what some people fear it might be and to demonstrate beyond doubt that it will be a Bill which is addressed to international terrorism.Deputy Ó Caoláin talked about the definition of terrorism that is to be found in the European framework decision. There is no doubt that the Justice and Home Affairs Council procedure, which requires text to be generated by the Commission, deliberated upon by the various officials and then finally at Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings, is a somewhat ponderous exercise and one which, from time to time when one is listening to it, is much less easy on the ear than what took place in this debate.We have to bear in mind, however, that we have undertaken international obligations. I was not a Member of this House when the particular framework decision was the subject of a resolution in both this House and Seanad Éireann allowing my predecessor to adopt the particular framework decision, but I am aware that in the period from 11 September 2001 to June 2002 there was significant pressure internationally for countries to take seriously the threat of international terrorism.One of the points I constantly make, and made at the time to anybody who would listen to me, is that just because we have serious work to do which must be done quickly does not mean it should not be done well. We should be careful about what we do, and that applies to this legislation. Some Deputies suggested we have been rushing this legislation. It has not been rushed. It was published in December. It is now February and we are debating the principle of it and we are about to engage in a process where it will go to a committee of this House and be subject to a line by line examination as to its exact meaning and the propriety of what is happening. I am entering  this process in that spirit. We have undertaken international obligations. We have signed up to conventions. In order to discharge those international obligations we must ratify those conventions by legislation. In relation to the European Union, we are obliged as a matter of Union law to implement, albeit in our own way and through our own legislative mechanisms, the substance of the framework decision.Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke about the definition of terrorism. I did say, and I did not mean it flippantly, that it is like an elephant. Everybody knows what is a terrorist act when they see a terrorist act but it is not so easy to define precisely what it is about that act that distinguishes it from, say, an act of war or a political assassination. It is not easy to come together with a few paragraphs which state that this is an act of terrorism, that is a freedom struggle, this is revolution, that falls into the category of terrorism. It is not easy to come up with legal definitions which are so precise and clear as to their meaning and yet act to categorise one thing into one category and one thing into another.By the same token, however, we cannot have a law which is entirely dependent upon the subjective intent or good conscience of the perpetrator. To go back to Deputy Durkan's example of Mr. Hitler in the 1930s, we all know there were apparently many people of good faith who supported him and who carried out terrible atrocities in his name, people who were satisfied in their own mind that they were doing the right thing. I have no doubt that some of the people who carry out atrocities now believe that they are meriting martyrdom in a next life or that they are pursuing justice internationally by the terrible things they do. I have no doubt that a number of the people involved in the events of 11 September, and the other catalogue of offences I mentioned in my opening contribution, did not believe they were acting in bad faith.I am open to amendment of the Bill to reduce its effect to precisely what we want to achieve, albeit in accordance with our international obligations. Whatever else we do, we cannot substitute the good faith of the individual as the arbiter of what is or is not acceptable. A bomb could not go off in a crowded supermarket or shopping centre and not amount to terrorism and it does not matter what the perpetrator believes is right or wrong or the direct or indirect effect he or she believes it will have.

It was suggested on a number of occasions that state terrorism was not comprehended by this legislation. I recall a reference yesterday to the Rainbow Warrior matter. That might amount to an offence under this statute and other acts which have been perpetrated from time to time. There is no  exemption for agents acting on behalf of a state from the ambit of this Bill. There is an exemption for armed forces of a state acting in an armed conflict and who are subject to international humanitarian law. That is a different matter but we are not talking about a Bill which states that secret agents of a state are somehow exempt from its effect because they are acting on behalf of a state.

I am and remain a liberal and I will not bring into law any measure which would have the illiberal effects described earlier. The text in the preamble to the framework decision states that that decision is not designed in any way to prejudice the civil liberties referred to by Deputy Higgins. If it is not sufficiently clear from the Bill in its present form that the preservation of those rights is maintained by the text to be enacted into Irish law, I am happy to amend the legislation to make it very clear that those rights are preserved. What I am doing in relation to the framework decision is meeting our obligations to transpose it into Irish law. I do not intend to put in something which is more draconian or less conscious of the need to preserve civil and political liberties in the State.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	442	We have some latitude, as this is not a formula which must be transposed into Irish law letter for letter. If amendments to the definition of terrorism are tabled which are consistent with the framework decision and are more apt to get nearer to the definition of an elephant, as it were, without actually providing a mathematical formula for the definition of an eleph ant, I will gladly go down that road. I assure Deputies I will consider improvements to the Bill to focus it more clearly than the language of the Justice and Home Affairs Council managed regarding what we all agree constitutes terrorism. Despite our arguments about the history of 100 years ago Deputy Higgins and I would agree, I assume, that to let off a bomb in a supermarket is terrorism by any standards. If we can move towards an agreed definition of what terrorism is that is consistent with our international obligations and which is more obviously consistent with our concepts of civil liberty and the like I will be happy with improvements to the Bill, something I stressed when opening the debate.Regarding Deputy Ferris's contribution, we are not saying terrorism is defined according to whether the individual concerned believes his or her actions are justifiable. There must be an objective definition of terrorism. It cannot be entirely subjective. I accept some of Deputy Ferris's points but I cannot offer a definition of terrorism which is based on the proposition that the mind or conscience of the individual perpetrator is decisive regarding the criminal nature of the act. That cannot be a fair definition of terrorism and would not be true to our international obligations.Deputy Mitchell referred to gardaí obtaining the records of telephone calls from telecommunications companies. It is not true that any garda can request such information. Under the 1993 Act a request for such information can only be made in writing by a garda of at least chief superintendent rank. The power to obtain telecommunications records has been very important in the State's fight against all forms of crime across the spectrum, from child pornography to drug dealing to murder. We should remember that.Deputy O'Dowd referred to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which has a twofold objective. It establishes a level of protection to be required to be applied to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes while in international transport and it also provides for measures against acts in respect of such material while they are in international transport as well as in domestic use, storage and transport. Ireland has ratified that convention.Deputy Durkan asked if the financing of terrorism provisions could be used to combat organised crime. The 1994 Act – the CAB legislation – is adequate to combat organised crime. The amendments to be made to this Act will fortify it in certain respects but the Act is not designed primarily to deal with organised crime, it is intended to deal with international terrorism.Deputy Naughten mentioned the jurisdictional aspect of the various offences. Those jurisdictions are in conformity with the framework decision and the conventions to which the Bill will give effect. The jurisdictions are wide but going further to accept universal jurisdiction could be constitutionally  suspect. Based on the advice available to me when I was Attorney General and since, it is arguable that the Constitution does not empower our State to adopt a universalist approach to jurisdiction so that, for instance, we could try an Australian for a crime committed in Antarctica. There are constitutional limits to the competence of the Irish State to adopt international jurisdiction.Deputy Costello stated in relation to the Middle East in particular that it is important to  address the causes of conflict when responding to the problem of international terrorism and I agree with him. Some Deputies' contributions echoed Deputy Costello's important point and I welcome that reminder.

It is rare that we get an opportunity to debate agricultural matters in the House. I am pleased this debate is taking place, particularly given recent debates on agricultural matters in this country.We, in Fianna Fáil, have a deep and unique insight into the needs of farmers and the agri-food industry. Our success stems from our unrivalled spread of membership and support throughout rural Ireland, but particularly within the farming community. Before we formulate and implement policies affecting farmers, we carefully determine what is in their best interests. We consult them, listen to their views, take action on their needs, defend their rights and interests and protect the benefits they receive under the Common Agricultural Policy and other relevant international agreements.We brought farmers into the social partnership process at its inception 16 years ago. That process has been a major factor in our economic success in recent years. Over the years farmers have made a constant and valuable contribution to social partnership. The economy has benefited greatly from that process and farmers and the farming and food industry have had their fair share of that success. Our success in confronting farmers' problems is in stark contrast to Fine  Gael whose record on agriculture is one of failure and futile bleating – I am not referring to sheep – mostly from the Opposition benches of this House.It is not long ago that the then Commissioner Ray MacSharry and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, put the most fundamental reform of the CAP in place. This involved transferring payments away from the meat companies and instead paying the price supports directly to farmers. The system was designed to reward the extensive type farming systems practised in Ireland and was less favourable to intensive systems practised in some other member states. When the Commission subsequently tried to dismantle these favourable arrangements for Irish farming in the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the Minister was on hand again to defend our farmers' interests and to negotiate enhanced payments to our farmers. Members must agree that there were objections to the proposals, but the right decisions were taken at that time.The package of measures the Minister negotiated brought direct payment rates to record levels. As a result, Irish farmers are now paid €1.6 billion annually in income supports through the Department. We tend to take little notice of the fact that income supports amount to €1.6 billion. I remember talking about millions of pounds years ago, but we are now talking about €1.6 billion. It is an important and increasing element of farmers' annual income and constitutes more than 70% of their total income at present.The Commission's agreement to allow payment of 80% of the support payments last October was crucial, given the awful weather conditions that farmers suffered throughout last year. This was, of course, only one of a number of significant measures that we in the Department of Agriculture and Food, under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, undertook on behalf of farmers because of the many difficulties they faced last year. I acknowledge those difficulties which were brought about by many factors. However, one aspect of these payments is a matter of some concern. Recent data indicates that 82% of farmers receiving direct payments get 43% of the payments, averaging €3,300 per farmer, while the remaining 18% received 57% of the total, averaging €20,000 per farmer. The top 10% of farmers took an average of €27,200 per farmer.I now turn to the economy in general. The Government is taking less money from workers and companies and Government spending has reduced by almost 10% of GNP. Exchequer spending is only a third of GNP and the budget figures were in surplus up to recently. Public capital spending is more than four times higher and the rate of unemployment has dropped ten percentage points in the last ten years. The national debt is one of the lowest in Europe, at 38% of GNP, and the cost of servicing this debt is lower today, in actual terms, than it was in the mid-1980s. Inflation, although considered high by EU  standards at 5%, is far below the 20% mark achieved in the early 1980s.

#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Mortgage interest rates, according to the Department of Finance, have fallen from 13% in 1985 to 4.75% today. Speaking of different times, I am long enough in this House to remember more serious crises in farming. I refer particularly to 1974, which I have personal reasons to remember very well. I recall leaving this House on Thursday evenings to spend the following weekend meeting my farming constituents and chairing meetings with banks when interest rates were in excess of 20%, in contrast to today's low rates.I wish to refer to forestry, having spent some time in the relevant Department in the late 1980s. The Government is committed to the continued development of the forestry sector which is one of the key elements of Ireland's rural development plan. The programme for Government commits to working to increase planting levels to 20,000 hectares per year. Around 90% of planting is currently undertaken by farmers, who increasingly view forestry as a viable land option, particularly in terms of its contribution to local and rural economies. Forestry will also play a pivotal role in the achievement of the Kyoto targets which will benefit us all.We rightly pride ourselves as producers of prime food. However, in 2001 the value of food imports, excluding beverages, was €3 billion compared with exports of €6 billion. This is not good enough, even allowing for the fact that much of the imports are of a type that are not produced here. I wish to look a little closer at what is taking place in the beef sector. We continue to make strenuous efforts to reopen former markets. Although the Egyptian market is open, we have not been supplying it to any significant extent. I urge processors and the industry generally to take up that challenge. While we try to extend our range of new markets, employing all the available resources of the State in these endeavours, I am concerned that some 11,000 tonnes of beef are imported here annually. Of this, 70% comes from other EU member states and 30% from third countries.I am at a loss to understand the reasons for these imports. The quantities involved are too great to suggest that they are catering for a niche market. I can only presume the importers are taking advantage of the financial difficulties being experienced in some beef producing countries to import at low prices and, in the process, are attempting to displace prime Irish beef on the home market. While no restrictions can be placed on such trade, which is permissible under Internal Market rules and WTO agreements, it is important that we are aware of the extent of the trade and that we continue to produce the quality  of beef for our domestic market that makes it competitive at all levels of consumption.In this regard, the conclusions of the food labelling group which reported recently are welcome, especially the recommendation that information on the origin of all meats should be indicated, irrespective of outlet. Bord Bia is also concerned about these imports and has initiated a counter measure, the Féile Bia campaign, to raise awareness across the community of the quality characteristics of home produced food products. I endorse that campaign and encourage all hotels, restaurants and food outlets to fully participate in this initiative. By doing so, they will enhance the value of their businesses and contribute in a tangible way to the growth and development of the Irish food industry and the economy in general.I am pleased the IFA has embarked on a campaign to demand that large supermarkets publicly account for their perceived excessive profit margins where farmers and consumers are concerned, particularly on beef, sheep meat and bacon. I hope it pursues that campaign with vigour until it is successful and I assure the organisation of the full support of my Department. It is outrageous that the primary producer of the highest quality meat is paid a small fraction of the final price the consumer must pay.

#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I wish to refer briefly to a number of issues within the time constraints. Farmers should not forget the massive support they received from all sections of the community during the foot and mouth disease crisis and the goodwill that was generated at that time. They must not forget the massive Exchequer support, in excess of €400 million, provided by this Government for the BSE slaughter for destruction and market support schemes. Most importantly, they must not forget that we are now facing the most fundamental review of the CAP to date. This is a major challenge which has the capacity to change the face of Irish farming. The Commission proposals for the mid-term review of the Agenda 2000 agreement are formulated with a view to meeting the threat in the WTO as well as the increasingly vocal requirements of consumers for safer food and a better physical environment.Our farm leaders must now focus on the threat to the entire framework within which farmers will produce and sell their products over the next ten to 20 years. They must row in behind the Department of Agriculture and Food and its Minister, Deputy Walsh, in defence of existing CAP support arrangements, as I know they will. For very good reasons, farmers in many countries, including EU countries, are protected to varying degrees from the full rigours of the marketplace and the basic economic laws of supply and demand. In the face of this, countries with little or no such support for their farmers consider that farmers in countries with higher levels of support are trading with unfair advantage on world markets. They are seeking, in the current WTO negotiations, to eliminate what they consider as unfair advantages. The supports provided by the European Union for its farmers are the prime target. European and Irish agriculture has to prepare a robust defence of the CAP in those negotiations.The threats in the WTO and the Commission's proposals are serious challenges. They transcend any arguments or dissatisfaction the farm organisations may have with the social partnership talks. Farm leaders would be best employed sitting down with the Department and the Minister to devise strategies to meet the robust challenges ahead. The most meaningful way of showing a united front to Commissioner Fischler is as a committed participant in a new partnership programme. We in Fianna Fáil have a vision and a long-term strategy for agriculture that will guide our approach to the major challenges ahead, the mid-term review of the CAP and the WTO negotiations.

However, it is about time people faced certain realities, which at times are hard to accept. Having been a Minister of State with responsibility for agriculture and now being Minister with responsibility for rural development, I accept there is a crisis, particularly in the stronger farming areas. That is, in large measure, caused by the World Trade Organisation rules and the CAP rules. Let us be honest, if it was not for CAP, the flight from the land would be much faster.There are huge challenges for the future. There are certain fundamentals we must recognise. It takes more and more land, no matter how it is used given the present rules and regimes under which we must work, to make a comparative income. The reality is, for example, that farmers with marginal land made a similar living 20 years ago as farmers with better land now. We recognised the difficulty for those on marginal land 20 years ago and we knew that the only way forward for a large number of farmers was a diversified rural economy. As we move more towards world prices and pressures on the CAP, which we can try to modulate but which we do not absolutely control, we must look at new ways of sustaining rural society.The spatial strategy published recently contains a clear vision for the development of rural Ireland. That vision must be one of mixed development. For example, the reality in the western countries is that the number of full-time farmers under 50 years of age is very small. This is because we had two choices, either amalgamate all the farms into very large farms or face the reality that there had to be some other income going into most farm households to make up an adequate family income. Those who do not want to recognise these realities and want to bury their heads in the sand are welcome to do so, but those who ignore the trends of the future will drive many more people off the land than those who say that the solution is to have a good, strong mixed economy in rural areas so that there are  off-farm opportunities for farm families compatible with staying in part-time farming.The debate must move forward in a realistic framework. I hope that those on the Opposition side who take part in this debate do not try to delude the people that we will be able to go back to a level of pricing in agriculture where people will be able to get a comparative industrial wage from 20 or 30 acres of land. That is not feasible and I think everybody on the Opposition side knows that is the case.Of course my Department will be looking for funds for rural development. We will be looking to develop a strong diversified rural economy, but I want to make it absolutely clear that we will not be seeking to do that on the backs of Irish farmers. We are totally in support of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in ensuring that the money which goes directly into agriculture continues to go into agriculture and that any money allocated to rural development will come from sources other than agriculture. To rob agriculture of the money and divert it to rural development would be to try to solve a problem by exacerbating or creating a bigger problem.The aim in the future is obviously to maintain as many farm families on the land as possible. We should take a flexible approach to this. We should take a family approach and allow people work out exactly how they are to do that. The alternative vision would be to say that we would only have full-time farmers and that ranch-style farming would be the solution for the future. That is certainly not my vision. Many farmers have proven that either they or their spouses – we should look at this as a family set-up – can earn off-farm income and can, in some cases, earn a diversified farm income from some other activity such as tourism while at the same time being very successful farmers.Having worked in the milieu of the west coast where 30 years ago we had to move towards part-time farming, it has always seemed that young farmers who remained in farming but also had an off-farm income were often in a position to farm better than those who were trying to earn a full-time living off the land because they had a two-way bet. They could afford to take the ups and downs and they had a steady income. They could invest in the farm and take the longer view. It sustained families and gave an adequate income.One must remember that even though the vast majority of production comes from the good lands of the midlands, south and east, a huge number of farm families are dependent on very small farms, on good land and particularly in the areas of marginal land. Sometimes when we debate agriculture we think only in terms of production and not in terms of households. Obviously my preoccupation is the quality of life of the people who, whether they have five acres on the Aran Islands or 5,000, 500 or 50 acres, are working the land of this country. My view is that each person is equally important. Each, as a citi zen, is entitled to an equal living in the country as far as we can give it. Therefore I say to those who, when they talk about farming, dismiss out of hand small farmers and farmers on marginal land, that these farmers are as important to farming because it is part of their livelihood as it is part of the livelihood of the big producing farmers.Tá go leor rudaí eile ar mhaith liom a rá.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	468	There is no doubt that the recent official data which show a fall in farm income clearly underlines the fact that 2002 has been a difficult year for farmers. This was caused by a combination of unprecedented bad weather, a drop in beef slaughterings from the high levels in 2001 and reduced market returns in areas such as dairying, resulting in an overall income decline for the year. I acknowledge that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, recognised at an early stage the warning signs with regard to farm incomes and instigated a series of actions to alleviate the problem. These included stronger market supports for dairy products, the removal of the Russian county ban on beef exports, increases in beef export refunds, an 80% advance in bovine premia payments, earlier payments of the 50% advance in arable aid, the use of set-aside land for grazing-fodder, simplification in the REPS application and improvements in the farm assist scheme. The combined effect of these measures was to reduce the impact of poorer market returns to farmers and prevent a much greater reduction in farm incomes.In 2002 the output value of most sectors was down from the exceptional levels of 2001 and inputs increased partly due to the adverse weather conditions. On a positive note, direct payments to farmers of €1.6 billion helped to support farm incomes and will continue to do so this year. These represented in 2002 an average payment of about €13,000 per farm, with about 125,000 farms in receipt of payments. Total support for the agri-food sector in 2002, including direct payments, market supports, disease control and research, training and advisory services, amounted to €2.8 billion. These are considerable sums by any standard and underline the support the Government is giving to farming.The support farmers received during the foot and mouth and BSE crises is part of a continuing process where the Government recognises the problems facing Irish farmers and responds in full. The Government is aware of the problems facing farming. There are problems and it is committed, in co-operation with the farming organisations, to solving them.Direct payments are the major part of most small farmers' incomes. The system of modu lation proposed by the EU Commission would reduce the direct payment to these farmers, who may only receive over €5,000 in payments. Modulation cannot be justified in these circumstances. Providing funding for rural development at the expense of farm incomes, which have always been the mainstay of rural economies, is a contradiction. Modulation would have a direct effect on different farming sectors. Sectors that do not depend as heavily on direct payments would not suffer the same adverse effect as the beef and sheep sectors. The effects of modulation would be disproportionate and I am glad the Minister, Deputy Walsh, made this clear to the Council of Ministers.Last week the Minister strongly opposed the Commission's proposals on the mid-term review. With his experience in negotiations over recent years, I have no doubt that he will continue to do that and secure the best possible deal for agriculture, rural Ireland and the farming community.

We consult them, listen to their views, take action on their needs, defend their rights and interests and protect the benefits they receive . . .I wonder if I am living in the same country. I attended a meeting in Killarney Heights on Monday night at which 400 farmers from north and south Kerry and part of west Cork attended. No member of the Government party was there to listen, consult, heed or offer advice. Here were 400 farmers who had come together to describe the drastic situation they endure – the alarming fall in farm income, the rising costs and their determination to remain viable and be part of Irish society.I grew up on a small farm. I remember 1966 when tens of thousands of farmers took to the streets. They came to the capital from every town in the country to seek justice. It is ironic that just a few weeks ago the farming community had to do something similar to bring to the attention of the Government and the wider public the terrible situation they are compelled to endure as a result of the lack of consultation and the refusal to address their needs. That is what the Government has done to farmers.I listened to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and his sincerity in seeking to preserve the fabric of society in the west. What has the Government done to preserve it? Tens of thousands of farmers have been forced to leave the land over the past 30 years. Their children grew up in an environment that was separated from their culture because of a lack of Government commitment and funding to maintain their viability and survival. Major problems are facing us. The farming community took to the streets a  few weeks ago in desperation so the leadership of their organisation could bring their situation to the Government's attention.The Government Deputies say nothing is wrong and speak about all the Government has done. I listened to the 400 men and women in Killarney. According to a report on the front page of our local newspaper, the only reason small and medium farmers are able to survive is that their wives go out to work to subsidise the household income. This affects more than the farming community, it is a rural problem.Ireland does not finish at a 50 mile radius around Dublin. The west and south-west of Ireland have been decimated by Government neglect. The small farming community has been wiped out by neglect. It is time the Government gave the rural community's needs equality of treatment with the rest of the country. The fishing community has been decimated. The shopkeeper is gone from rural Ireland, post offices are closing and Garda barracks are gone. Now the local national schools are gone. The collectivisation of our people, driven by the Government and Europe, exists for one reason, to decimate and break the morale and determination of those who are prepared to fight to live in rural communities.Lest the Government forget, it was the small farming community that built this State. Many people employed in this building and in the public service came from small farming communities. Let us get things straight and be honest with the people who have done this. When farmers take to the streets in the numbers they did and with the support of rural Ireland, they deserve to be listened to and heeded. Their needs and requirements are the same as everybody else's.

They are particularly important in Sligo-Leitrim, both as job creators and contributors to sustaining services in the area. Indeed, this is an area where alternative means of creating economic activity are inhibited by deficient infrastructure. While I agree with the vision of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, of a mixed rural economy, that is simply not possible without adequate infrastructure.Farming and the spin-off processing and service sectors, which depend on the output of the farms of Sligo-Leitrim, are essential to the economic and social fabric of our area. However, every year, indeed every month, farmers are leaving the land because they simply cannot make a living. If an industry in Sligo-Leitrim employing  even 100 people was threatened with closure, as happened in Ballinasloe last week, the response from Government would be to institute a campaign to replace the lost jobs. Why not make at least as strong an effort to preserve the jobs in farming and in the spin-off sectors in places like Sligo-Leitrim by giving them the necessary support now rather than bemoan the fact when it is too late to do anything constructive?There is an immediate way by which the Government could lend some substance to its lip service to farmers. It could immediately withdraw the increase in disease levies, as proposed in the budget, or abolish the levies. It could bring forward the funds necessary to make the REPS attractive enough to farmers to encourage them to participate in it. The numbers participating in the scheme are falling all the time because it is not attractive enough to encourage participation. The Government could decouple the green land and commonage in the commonage framework plans so that sheep farmers, particularly in the west, would have an opportunity to make a living.In the context of the real concern for the future of agriculture due to CAP reform, there are two areas which merit attention. The first is research, to ensure that farmers are able to produce at lowest cost. This is essential. Organic production also affords a valuable niche opportunity. It is unacceptable that Teagasc plans to close its research farm in Ballinamore, a centre which has done excellent work in producing information of great value to those working on difficult land. It also appears that Teagasc is considering closing the organic farm research facility in Athenry. This is a regressive step, but if it is pursued, I advocate that the excellent work being done in the field at the organic centre in Rossinver, County Leitrim, be expanded with substantial State support. I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, that if they are happy to let this facility go in Athenry, we would be delighted to get it in Rossinver.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Farmers are the backbone of the economy, particularly in rural areas. Over the past few years we have witnessed the exit of thousands of farmers from the land in Mayo. This process is being accelerated by the daft planning laws in place at the moment whereby even a farmer's son or daughter cannot live beside his or her father. We are forcing all these people into towns and cities, where there are too many people already. Then there is the whole situation regarding the implementation of the commonage framework plan, which is threatening the livelihoods of 4,500 farmers in remote mountain areas who are being forced to de-stock 150,000 sheep. There is an appeal system in place, but it depends on the support of 20% of people. So much for the rights of the individual farmer.The financial loss caused by the reduction of Mayo's sheep quota by over 55,000 was devastating for many rural DEDs. This loss of sheep quota alone takes €1.5 million across the board  out of the struggling rural areas of County Mayo. In Mayo, this is the equivalent of the loss of a 100-job industry. There is clear discrimination against sheep farmers who have both commonage and lowland, and the need to decouple these has been well highlighted.Farm income fell by 8.5% this year and the value of subsidies rose to 68% of total revenue, according to the CSO. Sheep farmers were hit worst of all, with their income falling by almost one third, while the value of milk output fell by 10%, cereals by 22% and pigs by 14%. If one adds inflation, the terrible fact is that farmers have suffered an income decline of almost 13% in real terms. It is no surprise, therefore, that 2002 was the worst year in farming over the last decade. While bad weather has been a factor, the main problem is falling prices for products. If product prices are reduced to a level far below the cost of production, it is a recipe for disaster. If this is not a crisis, what is?Then we have the talk in Europe of decoupling and so on. So much for the work ethic. So much for the rights of people to stay on the land. Those who are staying on their land are having their pride taken away. Even the Church of Ireland is speaking out against this, which is very important. When farmers end up transferring a substantial part of their CAP payments to the suppliers, processors or consumers, it is time to shout "stop". Then there is the scandalous situation regarding the designation, implementation and compensation of SSEs. This has been most unsatisfactory and there is a need for greater clarity. The situation regarding over-designation of land and SSEs must be looked at and adequate compensation paid to those affected.

This has cost the average farming family €10,000 in 2002 alone and the silage disaster has added another 20%, averaging €1,800, to the cost of bought-in feeds for the average milk producer. Farm businesses have had a nightmare experience in endeavouring to meet financial commitments, having suffered a 35% erosion in their incomes on average, which has also severely impacted upon family living expenses.Irish milk producers meticulously follow EU regulations, invariably to their own detriment, while heavily subsidised American producers flood world markets with cheaper product. It is a matter of urgency that the Government intervenes to bring much needed relief to farmers. No other sector of the community has taken such a hit in incomes as farmers. The Government has failed to put in place any appropriate strategies to address the dire state of the farming sector.All bar 16% of County Monaghan is designated as disadvantaged. Another 8% of the county meets the criteria for such designation, while all of the remainder of Connacht-Ulster is  already deemed disadvantaged. This glaring anomaly is crying out to be rectified. The Government's failure to produce a viability aid package to assist farmers worst affected by last summer's severe weather is to be condemned, as is its indifference to the IFA's proposal for a further nation-wide assessment by Teagasc to targeted aid. This targeted aid package was the bottom line for the farming community, and it has been conspicuously lacking so far.In the horticultural sector, Deputy Harney's proposal to limit the availability of non-European Economic Area labour by reducing the number of work permits issued will have disastrous consequences for the Irish horticulture industry. In recent years the horticulture industry has undergone dramatic changes and is now firmly dependent on non-EEA workers since the source of Irish labour dried up during the heyday of the Celtic tiger. An economic collapse of major proportions would be required before horticultural producers would be able to source Irish or EEA labourers, who do not find the nature of this work attractive.I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to come to the aid, even rescue, of the farming sector with a targeted emergency relief package aimed at relieving farmers deemed to be in greatest need. The participation of farmers' organisations as social partners in the ongoing pay talks to secure a partnership agreement will depend on the Government's response.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Upton, who is my party's spokesperson on agriculture, on her contribution to the debate. I am glad that so many speakers referred to the demise of rural Ireland. I spent ten years in this House advocating particular policies to try to arrest that trend but nobody listened.I told this House about the farming community being the backbone of the rural economy. I know that because we own a shop, and when times are hard we know which sector of the economy is particularly affected. I also indicated that a significant number of people were not benefiting under the current direct payments system. I warned of the impasse at which we have now arrived.I know elderly rural people who, because of the strangulation of bureaucracy, never filled out a form for a subsidy in their lives. I know an 86-year-old woman, a small livestock farmer, who was in this situation. I am glad to see some of the farming organisations now speaking out on this because I made these points in this House many times on behalf of the people who live in the boreens of rural Ireland. Nobody else shouted "stop". I was a lone voice in the wilderness at times. I said that the system of payments had to stop. If there is €2 million available in subsidies, it is important that the small farmer gets a reasonably fair share of it. Many of them did not, of  course. The people I am speaking about never got a penny in subsidies.The system will have to change to recognise the plight of those people as well. I warned of that. I remember, on one trip abroad, advocating the importance of the beef industry. I told people that we have the best beef, and so we have. People told me, however, that we can still only get one in four of our cattle onto the prime supermarket outlets across the world, particularly in the high-priced continental market. We should have been paying differential payments to encourage farmers to move into that market niche that offered greatest profits. The Minister for Agriculture and Food must face up to that. I speak as someone who advocated the cause of the beef finishers. They were wiped off the face of the Earth. They were missed from the ring every Tuesday or Wednesday in marts throughout the country. They were there previously, bidding and helping small storage farmers to survive.Like most of my generation, I believed that farm incomes could be increased by a combination of increasing farm output, controlling costs and scaling up to reduce overheads. Of course we have to have a differential and recognise the social and utility value of those small farmers. I agree with Deputy Cowley, we often make it more difficult for small farmers to survive through planning levels etc. An elderly farmer will often need his or her son or daughter to help him or her. We should realise the socio-economic input this has had.The world trade talks and mid-term review are extremely important. Cognisance must be taken of the fact that the American farm bill provided an additional $40 billion. It is clear that the Americans have shown scant regard for the agreements they have entered, as they have done elsewhere. There is no point in only Ireland obeying all the rules.Bureaucracy strangles farmers. I do not know what happened to the appeals system but I do not hear of any great results coming from it. We spent hours on the floor of this House working to refine it. I understood that one could represent a farmer who feels hard done by with the finicky penalisation of REPS, but I must have misunderstood. It is no wonder there has been such a poor uptake of REPS. If a farmer cuts a bush he will lose 10%. This is ludicrous. It is no wonder people are drifting away from the land. One would need to be a lawyer and accountant to be a farmer.Agriculture employs 200,000 people and provides 10% of GDP. I remember times when it was claimed that markets could be opened like switching on a light. I remember the con-jobs that were perpetrated. I remember being in the Red Cow Inn and what was said there. I remember people being fooled and taken in by this nonsense. There was a time when one wondered what aeroplane would arrive with a delegation to take  cattle with them. A few thousand tons was put on one boat but nothing happened after that.

The Minister should allocate more money to this.I look forward to the Finance Bill where there will have to be a U-turn. The N6, N4 and N52 run through Westmeath. We spent months negotiating a reasonable price for land for farmers. The budget had the biggest U-turn of all. I look forward to seeing who has the power at Cabinet to ensure the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, makes changes to capital gains tax and roll-over tax relief.

The Government kept telling us things were good when there was a mass exodus from farming throughout the country. In County Limerick in 1991 there were 7,366 farms and that number dropped to 6,186 in 2000, a decrease of 16%. Since then, farming organisations and those of us close to the land know this flight has accelerated. The number of full-time farmers in Limerick has dropped by more than 1,600, or 27%, since 1990. This is due to income loss. People cannot afford to live on the income afforded by small to medium sized farms – to say anything else is to attempt to perpetrate a con-job but the farming community will not believe it.Our local newspaper reported on the village of Mountcollins in County Limerick. At one time it had seven shops but it now has two. Enrolment at the local school fell from 107 to 52 in five years. This is as bad as the worst emigration experienced in the 1940s and 1950s in communities such as this in west Limerick.There were 180 milk producers in Limerick when Ireland entered the EEC; now there are 22 and Teagasc predicts it will be three in ten years' time. This reflects the utter devastation of rural communities. Unless the Government introduces policies to address the income of farmers this will continue. People will only return to the land when they see incomes improve.The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, reverse the decision to double the disease levies  and withdraw the abolition of the roll-over tax relief for CPOs. This would be a small start.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The Minister is in for a spring and summer of the greatest agricultural discontent this nation has seen and he has brought it all on himself. He is the best man I have ever met for blaming outside influences for problems. He has direct responsibility for disease levies. The Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance decided to break the agreement between all farmers and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Five years ago the Department decided farmers would pay for the first tests for TB and brucellosis and for this, the disease levies would be halved or removed. When the Minister got the chance in the Estimates, he did the mean thing and doubled them. This is only a small thing but it shows the regard the Government has for the farming community.Farmers will, no doubt, soon have to pay for the beef assurance scheme. I am told that 20% of the suckler cow grant that was due from 2000 will not be paid until next April or May when everybody else is already paid. I find it difficult to understand why the Minister stands over this as it is within his remit.I have trouble with the way the Government is dealing with the Fischler proposals. Three figures stand out in the proposals: 70 cent per gallon of milk, 70 cent per pound of beef and €70 per ton of grain. How does the Minister expect farmers to make a living in the future? I believe the talk about decoupling is a red herring. The main issue is whether a farmer can make a decent living for his family. I cannot see this happening under the Fischler proposals as they stand.I remember the Minister being at a press conference at Mellows College in Athenry. He stood ten feet tall, he said Irish agriculture needed this, but as soon as the farm was set up he decided to close it. I understand that the rural economy division will be based in Athenry as a sop, but the Government will close the rest of it.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Farmers' backs are to the wall like never before and the dire income in farming is threatening the survival of full-time family farming. With farming already in crisis, the Government put the boot in with spending cuts to the tune of €200 million in the budget and measures such as the increased disease levy, the abolition of the roll-over tax relief for the CPO of land and cutbacks in the national development plan commitments.The Government promised in the programme for Government to open the markets. It promised the introduction of tax relief for farmers. It underpinned the beef industry by the national beef assurance scheme and promised farm development funding, but it has reneged on all that.The income crisis is due to the collapse in farm prices, which are not even covering the cost of  production. However, the price of foodstuffs on the supermarket shelf has not gone down. Where has that money gone? For example, Irish Food Processors' pre-tax profits grew by 320% since 1999. According to the latest accounts for March 2002, the company saw an operating profit of €38 million. Mr. Goodman has taken out €41 million in dividends since he regained 100% ownership of that company.Irish agriculture supports 300,000 workers not only in farming but in the food industry. The only action the Minister has taken to date to support these workers is to try to close the smaller slaughtering plants and reduce working hours in the bigger plants. Since 1 January this year, these plants have been told by the Department that it is reducing the hours for which inspectors are available. As a consequence, some plants will now have to close for up to as much as one week every month. This is to try to force out competition, which helps support prices for farmers. However, the consumer is the big loser, with small operations which keep the big players from controlling the domestic market being forced out of business – so much for consumer protection and lower prices. This is compounded by the policy of the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to buy out and close some of these smaller plants.The rural economy is inextricably linked to agriculture. Weakening agriculture and food production will undermine these jobs, especially in the current economic climate. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, is neither willing nor able to do anything positive to help the farming community. I remember sitting across from the Minister when he appeared on "Prime Time" and he talked about developing new products and business for Irish agriculture. One of the areas was organic farming. What has he done to develop new products and a growing market for organic produce? He has closed it down. That shows the level of his commitment to his priority for new products and the development of alternative enterprises for farmers. I ask the Minister to shape up or ship out.

He wants us to remember his record of action. His record of action this year, following the most appalling weather conditions last year, is that he organised and agreed to a 9% cut in the Book of Estimates, 44% in the farm development section, 19% in REPS and 13% in respect of An Bord Bia and Teagasc. He then appeared on television and said that farmers need better advice and could do better marketing. How can they do that when he removes the necessary tools from them? He went on to double the disease levies. The Government removed the roll-over on capital tax.I miss two Members from the Chamber, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and Deputy Ned O'Keeffe—

We do not have shipments of live cattle or meat to Egypt, except for the election package.The Minister, Deputy Walsh, stated that farmers get an income of €45,000 per year. He also said that farmers eligible for the farm assist scheme are in receipt of an income of €13,000. He said that he hoped that some 15,000 farmers would be eligible for the scheme, but only 8,000 farmers participate in it and they are in receipt of less than half of the income he suggested to the general public.There is a misinformation campaign to try to divide farmers from the rest of community. In his contribution to this debate, the Minister said the Government gave €2.8 million from the Exchequer to farmers. However, only €0.8 million of that amount was taxpayers' money, as €2 million of it was compensation money from Brussels. That represents another attempt to cause division.The Danish Government works with its pig farmers. Only this week a friend of mine, one of the few pig farmers left in County Cavan, met the Danish authorities and was assured they work with the Danish pig farmers to come to sensible arrangements.I have a letter from the Minister, Deputy Cullen's, personal secretary, to the effect that there will be no meeting until the Bill is imposed and that those concerned will then have the right to put in place some type of new structures. We need the withdrawal of the €10 million disease levy, the reinstatement of the roll-over tax relief for the CPO of land and the consolidation of holdings. We need a workable agreement for the nitrate directive with a REPS and farm buildings programmes. It is a fact that people with degrees – I am not talking about ordinary farmers – make mistakes in filling out some of the forms required. We need a commitment from the Government to fight for the needs of our farmers at European and WTO level. There are three Ministers here, three wise men.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Having listened to the debate and having dealt with farmers and farming organisations during recent months, the problem is that the Government and the Minister, in particular, have neither a vision nor a clear understanding of where we should be going in terms of farming futures, careers and incomes for the years ahead.I had the doubtful privilege of co-chairing the World Trade Organisation talks in Singapore in 1996. It was perfectly obvious then that Argentina, New Zealand and Australia would mount a ferocious campaign in terms of the structure of the CAP, farming incomes and farming on a global scale, and that is beginning to take root in a serious manner.The farmers in the Gallery and those throughout the country have lost the hope that the Government can deal with their problems. I have not heard a speaker mention that Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union next year. There does not appear to be any clarity as to the action that the Minister can take on behalf of the Government and that the Government can take on behalf of farmers to sustain farm incomes, to give some hope to young people in  terms of farming careers and to dictate that kind of future.Commissioner Fischler obviously wants to leave behind a legacy of some sort of reform in terms of the CAP. This contract is up to the end of 2006. We do not even know whether the Government can hold the line on that, never mind deal with the moneys in the budget that are there up to 2013. The first step that should be taken is to have confirmation from the Minister, on behalf of the Government and the people, that the 2006 contract stands. That, at least, would give us some time to consider what options are open to us between 2006 and 2013, and thereafter. If Commissioner Fischler wants to do this and Prime Minister Berlusconi wants to have the next Treaty of Rome signed in Rome during his Presidency, that means that the issues concerning Europe in the next Intergovernmental Conference would have to be decided on by the people in a referendum, but I do not envisage that fitting into the timescale that is involved here.The issues of destocking, of green land and the designation of areas cause immense concern to farmers and those who might aspire to become involved in farming. I ask the Minister and his fellow Ministers of State to explain why it is that when an area is to be designated it appears on the paper as a fait accompli. Why are farmers in the area not approached and the scientific reasons for the proposed designation outlined to them? It is only a matter of courtesy. It causes controversy and rising antagonism when these announcements appear in newspapers stating that an area has been designated and farmers have no option but to comply with it.We have a commendable level of traceability and Irish beef and foodstuffs can be traced back. However, at the same time, a person may purchase pub grub that comprises beef approved by the EU but from an unknown source and without the same element of traceability. That is a cause of concern and frustration to producers in this country, especially young farmers.It is an undoubted fact that incomes have fallen. The Minister has been operating in Europe on false figures and it is not like him to do something like that. He should be able to say to the farming community what Fianna Fáil stands for in government. This question is often asked of us. We stand for the preservation of life in rural areas, clear farming structures, farming careers and incomes. We are clear on this. We should hold the line until 2006 to give us breathing space to consider what we must do between 2006 and 2013. If the Minister cannot manage that, he should not be in the position he is in because the fate and livelihood of thousands depends on him. They have lost hope that he has clarity or vision as to what the Government wants for the farming community.Rural and provincial Ireland is going down the tubes. Other areas and sectors do not want any more houses built in their areas. They do not  want people returning from England or America to live with their kith and kin and to play whatever role they can within the farming community. It is a long time – 30 years ago – since the late Sean Flanagan said that farming was heading to a position where part-time farming would become the norm and where it would be essential given the structures that would be put in place. I met a farmer in Drogheda last week who, with 220 acres and working 20 hours a day, could barely make it pay. Despite this, because 15 acres are alongside the motorway, he could have afforded to lose €20,000 for the next ten years and still have something left over. However, the Minister abolished roll-over relief and has forced this man from the land.The Minister should focus on holding the line until 2006 and beyond to 2013. The Irish Presidency next year should avail of the opportunity given to other small agricultural countries to build allies so that farm structures, livelihoods and incomes that have been the bedrock of the country for decades will not be lost because of the Minister's incompetence.

I thank those who spoke in support of the motion. I would like to put one issue to bed. I said that all the problems of agriculture do not begin and end with the Minister, Deputy Walsh, that they are the Government's responsibility. I outlined that the Taoiseach, in his usual modus operandi, would seek to replace the Minister in 12 or 18 months after our EU Presidency, perhaps with the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who made a good speech this evening.What the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, outlined was aspirational. He spoke about housing in rural areas and the national spatial strategy, a document that exists purely for optics. It is important to point out so that people do not have false hopes that the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has nothing to do with the provision of housing in rural areas. It is a matter for local authorities. We read in the newspapers that he was the great white hope, but he has done nothing to encourage this area.The Ceann Comhairle knows that people from north Meath can become animated about agricultural issues, as Deputy Brady, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, normally does. However, when he was present in the Chamber last night, he kept his head down. Silence construes consent. He knows that con ditions are difficult. That drove home a message to me.The Minister stated that the record of the Government speaks for itself. It certainly does. That is why we tabled this motion. We agree with the second half of the motion—

Some 200,000 people are employed in the sector which accounts for 9.5% of gross domestic product and had exports in the region of €7 billion last year. Despite this, farm incomes fell by 8.5%. This is a serious issue.Let us go back over what the Government has done. It spoke about opening up markets. What markets has it opened? The Egyptian market reopened in September 2001 and there was one shipment of 60-plus tonnes in April 2002. There was nothing before and nothing since, and that shipment was heavily subsidised. It was an election gimmick.The Minister spoke about underpinning the beef industry with the national beef assurance scheme. This was passed by the House in 1998 and has not yet been implemented. Neither has the dairy herd certification scheme which is vitally important to the dairy industry – as I pointed out to the Minister, €32 million was lost in his home county last year because of a drop in prices.The Government spoke about reinforcing Teagasc but took €12 million from it. Now the agency intends to close the only organic college in the country in Athenry. I hope that does not happen and that the Minister uses his influence to prevent it.On environmental measures, we repaid €30 million to Europe for the REP scheme because it was insufficiently attractive to farmers. Inputs were too costly and there was too much red tape and planning.We spoke about developing farm waste management and improving structures and equipment to increase our competitiveness. The national development plan put aside a certain figure and it was cut back by €23 million in the Estimates. This is the record. There is no denying or getting away from it.The Government said it would consider as a matter of urgency tax incentives for young farm ers, but nothing appeared in the budget except for the abolition of roll-over relief, a relief that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, negotiated. We do not have difficulty with a person paying taxes, but when a person must pay capital gains on an asset that he or she has had to dispose of unwillingly—

It got rid of the tag-a-bag  scheme and now it wants to put that second tag in sheeps' ears – I understand that there will now be two tags in sheeps' ears. That is a good way of getting rid of red tape.During the tractorcade, the Minister sought to undermine farmers and it backfired on him. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, spoke in favour of the farmers and intimated that the bovine disease levies were not a good thing.Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is not present. He is like the Phantom of the Opera. Perhaps he will come out from behind the curtain when the vote is called. He stepped up on the side of a tractor during the protest in support of farmers but he will not step out in favour of them now. He had his opportunity.I have no problem with someone introducing a difficult measure, but they should defend it if they support it at the time. If they do not defend it, they should vote against it. The Fianna Fáil press office set out to undermine farmers and they sent out Deputy Ardagh. Deputy Glennon was not silly enough to go out because he knows the difficulties the farmers in north County Dublin are experiencing. He knows the difficulties with the prospective abolition of Bord Glais and the problems that is causing for many vegetable growers. However Deputy Ardagh took the hit in a well-orchestrated event.I regret we do not have enough time to discuss agricultural issues. Just once in the past six months, during the discussion of the Estimates, have we had a debate here. I ask the Minister to use his influence with the Taoiseach to give more time to agriculture, which gives employment to 200,000 people and was worth €7 billion last year. When I go down the country, farmers say they never hear anyone talking about agriculture. It is not that we do not talk, but it gets no coverage. People talk about the politicians not being in the House, but where are the media when they are needed to put forward the message that people are willing to stand up for them. I commend this motion to the House.

I am appalled that the Government has cut back the grant to this programme, which helps our emigrants, by 5% this year. These are the people who have served this country so well. When there was no EU money coming into this country, these people sent back money from Britain and America. This was the money that kept the Government here afloat.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	527	A task force on emigration was set up and it recommended that the grant to Britain would be increased by 500%, but what did the Government do? The minute there was a downturn in the economy it cut the funding by 5%.I have been contacted by many people in Britain who are involved with Irish groups. People who have not stood in this country for 30 and 40 years have been brought back by these voluntary groups. Those groups depended on the funding from the Irish Government but it cut the funding this year.Over the coming weeks many of our Ministers will be heading out of the country to America. The Taoiseach and Deputy Harney may not have the Government jet in time but they will have some other jet to fly them to America. Whatever jet they use, I want them to remind President Bush of our emigrants who could not come home for Christmas. These are the sons and daughters who could not return here because they do not have work permits in America. I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister to represent those people when they visit the White House. Instead of taking the tea or coffee in the White House, they should do serious business and try to get our young emigrants looked after.In relation to this particular grant in Britain, many of the groups were disappointed because they had many meetings with the Department yet they were not told that the fund would be cut back. I was disappointed about that because these groups do wonderful work for our emigrants in Britain, particularly those who have not done so well. They have looked after them, tried to get them into shelters, fed them and brought some of them home. Shame on the Government for cutting back the fund and for turning on our emigrants who were so good to this country when there was no European Union.I ask the Minister of State and the Government to examine this issue again. Rather than cutting back the funding by 5% the Government should honour the recommendation in the report on our emigrants, which stated that the fund should be increased by 500%. I ask that it be increased by 500% because many welfare groups in Britain depend on it.I will finish where I started. We let down our emigrants in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s when they had to leave this country. Some of them did  not have a word of English. I always remember the story told by my father about the first train which left Achill. There was a tragedy in Scotland in which hundreds of Irish people were burned. They were people who had to leave this country because there was no work or anything for them here. They sent home the parcel, as Deputy Kenny said, but the most important thing they sent home was sterling and the dollar. They kept this country going when there was no EU.I ask the Minister of State and the Government not to turn their backs on our emigrants. Some of them in Britain and America have not done so well and we must not forget them because they did not forget this country.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The bulk of DION grants are contributions to the salaries of front-line advice workers in Irish welfare organisations. Most of these are based in London but also in other areas in Britain with significant Irish populations. Helping Irish people to improve their life skills and employment prospects and issues concerning housing, benefits entitlements and health are crucial areas of advice and assistance offered by these workers. In addition, grants were made each year to second-tier organisations which represent Irish organisations and groups and which promote the welfare of the Irish community – the Federation of Irish Societies, the Action Group for Irish Youth, the London Irish Elders Forum and, more recently, the Irish Travellers Movement in Britain.DION grants went to 57 organisations in 2002 and 21 of those are currently funded on a three year basis which supports capacity building and access to more statutory funding and retention of trained staff. In addition, a small amount of funding was given to a few of these agencies for social and health-related activities for the elderly.As the Irish-born population grows, demand is growing for advice and support regarding repatriation of elderly Irish people. For the past two years DION has funded two organisations which provide advice and assistance to elderly Irish people who wish to return to live in Ireland: Aisling, a return to Ireland project in Camden, and the Safe Home programme in Mulranny. As a result of their efforts 125 elderly Irish people have returned permanently.The Government has been able to dramatically increase the level of funding available to DION over the years – it was £500,000 for many years and only reached £750,000 in 1999. The Government increased this above £1 million in 2000 and above £2 million in 2001 to improve the level of support for voluntary organisations which provide advisory and welfare services for Irish emigrants in Britain. It was maintained at that level in real terms in 2002, at €2,708,000. The amount  of DION grants was €15.286 million up to the end of 2002 and €18 million including this year's allocation. The doubling of the fund in 2001 represented a new record level of support for Irish emigrant welfare services in Britain. It was recognition by the Irish Government of the essential work of Irish welfare organisations.This increase in funding has had a number of positive outcomes. It encouraged new applicants for DION grants – up to 57 organisations now receive grants compared to 40 in 1999 and 2000. The salaries of 105 workers dedicated to the welfare of the Irish community are now supported by DION – that is more than double the number two years ago. Almost 30% of jobs in specifically Irish organisations are now supported by DION and it is estimated that approximately 30,000 Irish people were assisted by DION grants in 2001 – 24,000 were assisted by Irish welfare organisations and 6,000 were helped by non-Irish managed organisations. Approximately one quarter of the fund supported capacity building posts and projects in 2001 and 2002. This helps to secure funding from other sources and to develop the organisations, allowing them to operate more efficiently and ultimately benefit the Irish community. The size of the grants is substantial. For example, €133,000 went to the London Irish Centre.The reduction in the 2003 Estimates affected all areas of expenditure in all Departments and my Department's Vote was subjected to a cut of 5% across the board. This was applied to all subheads. The outcome of the Estimates process was a 5.3% reduction in the Department's budget for 2003. In line with this, the funding voted to DION was reduced by 5% from last year's level. However, a purely arithmetic-based approach does not give the full picture as it does not take account of the now more favourable euro-sterling exchange rate.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	529	That is social welfare.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	530	When looked at in terms of pounds sterling it can be seen that due to the appreciation of the euro since June 2002, the sterling equivalent of the DION fund was in the order of £1.623 million. The sterling equivalent of the 2003 Vote is now equivalent to £1.688 million, up from £1.623 million. There has therefore been no reduction of impact in the UK to date. If the euro appreciation continues DION-funded agencies will not find themselves at any financial disadvantage this year – they could in fact gain from that appreciation.The report on the task force on policy regarding emigrants is a milestone in the process of developing a coherent long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs. A very significant increase in funding for immigrant services world wide was recommended –€18 million for 2003, increasing to €34 million in 2005, with €8 million of this for welfare services in Britain in 2003, rising to €12 million in 2005.I wish to continue to have an input in ongoing policy development for Irish emigrants and I intend that my Department is represented on the new Agency for the Irish Abroad or whatever new co-ordinating structure is established by the Government. Even when the Government no longer has responsibility for the DION fund, I will give whatever support I can to improve the situation of the most vulnerable members of the Irish community abroad.

Its prefab building is 19 years old and beyond repair. It is held together by wire mesh on the outside wall, which suggests it is a papier mâché building, a building of damp paper which is clearly rotten to the core. The wire mesh was applied to keep the structure from collapsing. The handles fell off the doors and the windows are falling out – one pane fell out yesterday so wind could cause the whole structure to collapse. There is no point in trying to repair it as it is already past its best before date.The school itself is no better. There are structural cracks in the wall, with one extending from the roof to the floor. One can see what is happening outside through the crack but wind and rain also pass through it. If the crack is repaired it opens up again because the outside wall is separating from the school.The roof of the school leaks, which means teachers must mop up the water when it rains. Water is also coming up through the floors of the school, including in the toilet area. The windows do not open because of the damp – they are swollen and in poor repair. The walls are also damp, as is the rest of the school. The boiler house and foundations are subsiding.There are 50 children in this school, 25 of whom are in the prefab. The condition of the prefab is unacceptable under any circumstances. It is unchristian to expect young children to put up with such conditions in winter, apart from the health and safety issues. What message are we giving our children when we ask them to endure such hardship? How can they be expected to learn or enjoy good health? How can their teachers be expected to give of their best when  teaching? Although an application for emergency works was made in March 2002 the school has received nothing in writing. That is unacceptable.

The 2002 capital programme has been published and full details of individual projects are available on the Department website, www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in architectural planning and at other schools, such as Mulranny, that have not yet commenced the architectural planning process. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety matters. I thank the Deputy again for giving the Minister for Education and Science the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Since 1890, Dublin's municipal school of music, known as the College of Music since 1963 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama since 1993, has provided musical instruction at moderate charges for up and coming musicians from Dublin and its  catchment areas. It has served the people well over the years and many or Ireland's most renowned musicians received tuition there.The college has a proud tradition of service to the people of Dublin and to music education generally. The value of the college to the development of music has been confirmed in studies over the years. It caters for a wide mix of abilities for children from four years of age upwards by providing an affordable and accessible education in music. This includes the development of the performing aspect of music education for children, which cannot be adequately catered for in the school curriculum.Notwithstanding the 1% increase in the pay budget, there will be a shortfall of up to €3 million due to the cost of the introduction of new European social legislation and the fact that the budget does not provide for pay commitments in the national pay agreement. Parents are deeply concerned at the implications of potential cuts already planned, including a possible cut of 150 hours out of 300 teaching hours per week across the part-time area, the cancelling of pre-instrumental and junior workshop classes, affecting up to 100 students, the reduction of the duration of musicianship classes from one hour to 45 minutes and the possible 100% increase in part-time student fees from €353 to €706.The teaching of music is the second oldest discipline in Dublin Institute of Technology. Enshrined in its introduction was the stated principle of the three As – availability, accessibility and affordability. This legacy, and its associated responsibility, is as valid today as when the college was first established.Parents and teachers are concerned at the direction in which the college is heading, particularly at first and second level. This has not been helped by the fact that enrolment figures in the college have decreased from 2,600 in 1994 to 1,400 in the current year. The proposed cuts, if implemented, could change the ethos of the college, make it unaffordable for the majority of students and make it elitist, and that is not the intention of the president of the college.Parents make huge sacrifices to bring children to music classes. Any change in policy will deprive their children of access to first class music teaching. Limiting access for talented young students will, in the long run, have a negative impact on the number of musicians in Ireland. Fees must be pitched at an affordable level. If fees are doubled it would deal an unsustainable body-blow to the education budgets of many and put music education beyond the means of the children of working class families.Dublin Institute of Technology is one of the primary third level institutes in the State and its conservatory is Dublin's equivalent to those conservatories in Europe and the US that nurture young talent.The Minister is aware that the PCW agreement includes protective clauses that state there are schools of music in Cork, Dublin and Waterford Institutes of Technology and that those schools should include the provision of music education at a wide range of proficiency levels. It proposed the establishment of a special working group with representation from all relevant parties to make recommendations on the most suitable arrangements for the future delivery of this course. What progress has been made with this working group? Notwithstanding recommendations made, the Minister has an obligation to ring-fence finance for the further development of the college, particularly at first and second level.As a Dublin TD I am appealing for full consultation with all relevant parties. I hope that teachers, parents, the principal and the Dublin Institute of Technology can reach a sensible agreement to their mutual benefit. The Conservatory of Music and Drama is part of the history and tradition of Dublin. It is up to all of us to protect and maintain our heritage. That is the Minister's responsibility as much as that of the Dublin Institute of Technology. We cannot afford to lose this and should get together to ensure its future.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science the position in relation to the issue raised by the Deputy. The Dublin Institute of Technology is a statutory body established under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992. The principal function of the institute under the 1992 Act is to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State. Under the Act, the governing body is required to submit annually an operational programme and budget through the City of Dublin VEC to the Department of Education and Science for approval by the Minister for Education and Science.An annual budget for the institute is allocated on the basis of pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of the programmes and budget submission and having regard to the available funding and to the Government's commitments and priorities.The implementation of the programmes and budget and the management of the resources of the institute are matters for which the governing body and management of the institute are responsible. This includes decisions regarding the operation and management of the Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama. As is the case with all the institutes of technology, the final decisions regarding programmes to be provided are matters for the management authorities of individual institutes within the context  of the available funding. While individual budgets have not yet been finalised, the overall recurrent allocation for the technological sector in 2003 is €372.9 million. This is 1% more than was provided in 2002.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I was forced to raise this issue as a result of a number of calls I received from distraught constituents at the weekend. The situation is totally unacceptable. A young man telephoned to tell me about his parents, an 80 year old man who cannot clothe himself and his 86 year old wife. They had five hours home care per week, one hour per day, but now that has been cut to two hours. What will people do if the home help is not available on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday when their families are not there? It is not realistic, sensible or constructive. Another person, who is a home help, wrote to me about the fact that her nine hours have been cut to three. The aged person she looks after has Alzheimer's disease and lives on her own. She does not know at times whether to get out of bed and she totally depends on her home help and on her neighbours. I spoke to the health board officials who were sympathetic. They said they would have to reconsider the issue. However, when I discussed the issue with them at length, I realised they would only consider it within the decimated budget for home helps and carers. They were not looking at the budget of administrators, but of those at the bottom of the ladder.I do not make any apology for raising this issue in the House because this is where decisions are made. The Minister for Health and Children must provide an allocation if it cannot be found within the health board's budget. We cannot allow those who have given their lives to this country to be treated in this way. The people in the two cases I mentioned worked hard all their lives. They were not layabouts, but genuine family people. It is wrong that they are being treated in this way.I have received several letters from people who are going into homes. One such letter states that all current subvention places are filled and that there is a waiting list in operation for subvention grants. It is difficult to understand how someone in desperate need of a home, who does not have any money or resources, could be put on a waiting list. Such people have been told their forms will be evaluated. However, if they try to fund their stay in a home, they are not entitled to a refund.I also received a letter from a young woman who suffers from depression and who fell recently and injured herself. She wanted to get a taxi to attend a physiotherapy session. When she telephoned my office, my secretary contacted the relevant person. That person was nice to her, but she said there was no money left for taxis for people in need. How can that be possible in the month of February? What are we doing? The situation is desperate.A number of people with intellectual disabilities have also written to me. They have been told that money has not been allocated to help them. I have received letters from people who are well off and from those who are not well off. A person with an intellectual disability is still suffering.The most important letter I received came from a lady who looks after her Down's syndrome son. She stated that the level of civilisation of a society is often measured by the level of care accorded to its most vulnerable. While she welcomed the fact that successive Governments responded to pressure, she regretted the fact that it was necessary to take some cases to court. She gave the example of a person with a handicap having to leave at 7.30 a.m. to get to school because it takes two hours to travel 15 miles. That type of service for the disabled and the handicapped is not acceptable. As the parent of a young man with Down's syndrome, she is apprehensive about the present ruthless attitude of the Minister for Finance. She wants to know if the vulnerable will be expected to suffer again as a result of swingeing cutbacks or readjustments. She also wants to know if they, like the rest of us, will be asked to pay for the mismanagement of the country's finances. That is a plea from the heart.I have received dozens of similar letters. Another example is that of a young man who wants help for his sister. This is an extremely important issue which must be dealt with.

I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify the matter relating to the provision of health related services to people with disabilities, particularly to those in the North-Eastern Health Board region. The provision of health related services for people with  disabilities, physical, sensory or intellectual, and for those with autism is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. My Department has since 1997 allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector which has resulted in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health related services being provided to people with disabilities.Additional funding of approximately €26 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities and those with autism in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to further enhance the services in the sector. Some €13.3 million of this funding has been allocated for services for those with an intellectual disability, while €13 million has been assigned to those with physical or sensory disabilities. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €288 million, which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base.Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential, respite, home support services which includes personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding, more than €20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further €81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and approximately 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 2000 and 2003, additional ongoing revenue funding of almost €17 million has been provided to the North-Eastern Health Board for the provision of health related services for people with disabilities and those with autism. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of health related services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities and the consultative and development committees for intellectual disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and advocates for people with disabilities are represented on these committees.I understand the North-Eastern Health Board is undertaking a review in relation to the prioritisation of hours available for home help services and, in tandem, the development of agreed criteria with the intention of ensuring that priority  is given to the most vulnerable groups – people with disabilities and older people.

The tunnel will provide direct motorway access to Dublin Port and is expected to be open in early 2005. On completion, the tunnel will very significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre. National Roads Authority estimates suggest that in the year of opening 7,200 heavy goods vehicles per day will use the tunnel.With a clearance height of 4.9 metres and an operating height restriction of 4.65 metres, the Dublin Port tunnel is higher than most European tunnels where height limits apply. The tunnel also fully complies with an EU directive which requires that heavy goods vehicles up to four metres in height must be accommodated in member states when undertaking international journeys.In addition, according to a survey carried out by the Dublin Port Company in 2002 of trucks exiting the port, over 98% of all trucks were below 4.65 metres and will be accommodated by the tunnel. In view of the above, and following discussion with the NRA and Dublin City Council regarding this matter no decision has been taken to increase the height of the tunnel.

It was in this context of developing a national policy perspective that early last year my Department engaged consultants to undertake a comprehensive strategic rail review of both passenger and rail freight services. The primary purpose of the review is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail sector including freight in Ireland over the next 20 years. Central to the review is an examination of the potential for rail freight services as well as the associated implications for the environment and the road network. The review is due to be published shortly.

Once the Government has had an opportunity to consider the findings and recommendations of the strategic rail review I propose publishing the document. Due to the recognition that transport policy cannot proceed in isolation from spatial strategy generally, there was explicit reference in the terms of reference for the strategic rail review that the framework for future rail development in the review had to take account of the national spatial strategy. Accordingly, the conclusions of the national spatial strategy have an important bearing on the strategic rail study.

The Government strongly pursued the implementation of its strategy for road safety, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government. The strategy prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It established quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority was accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users.The strategy has been the subject of ongoing monitoring by the high level group on road safety which has published a series of annual progress reports. The fourth progress report was published recently. The report shows that real and worthwhile gains were made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. Between 1997 and 2001 there has been a 13% reduction in road deaths and significant reductions in serious injuries. It also confirms that the targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met.

I am strongly supportive of the promotion of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. There are many options that can be considered for the furtherance of this proposal. Equally, there are many issues that need to be taken into account. In particular, there is the issue of the overall operational control of the corps. While it would seem that it should be placed under the overall control of the Garda commissioner, its relationship with other members and divisions of the Garda force would need to be established.Detailed consultation is ongoing between my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. In addition, international experience in the management of traffic law enforcement is being researched with a view to the determination of the optimum structure for a traffic corps in Irish circumstances.

I should explain that the Irish Aviation Authority controls some 100,000 sq miles of international airspace in addition to domestic airspace.According to the Irish Aviation Authority, a total of 465,204 en route civil and 6,895 en-route military aircraft flights flew through total Irish controlled airspace in 2001. The figures for 2002 were 450,022 civil flights and 8,716 military flights. Figures for 2003 to date are not yet available. It should be pointed out that a much smaller proportion of military en-route flights fly through domestic airspace with the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs while a smaller proportion again land at Irish airports.The total revenue raised by the IAA in respect of en-route, terminal and communications charges to civil flights in total Irish controlled airspace was €77.3 million in 2001 and €75.2 million for the 11 months ending November 2002. Figures for December 2002 and January 2003 are not yet available.

It also decided that a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport was to be included in phase one. Since then, the Railway Procurement Agency has concentrated its work on developing proposals for this phase. A preliminary public consultation has taken place and a prequalification exercise for potential bidders was launched by the RPA in mid-2002.In November 2002, my Department received the outline business case for phase one from the RPA. More recently, Iarnród Éireann submitted preliminary proposals for a heavy rail link to Dublin Airport by extending a spur either from the Maynooth line or the northern suburban line. Following completion of the evaluation of the Metro outline business case and the Iarnród Éireann proposals by my Department in the coming weeks, I intend to bring proposals to the Government. The outline business case put forward for the metro includes cost benefit analyses, a financing model, system options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project and the estimated timescales involved.Until a decision is taken by Government, it would be premature to anticipate costs and timescales. The costs involved will be determined by a number of factors including the route alignment chosen and the structure of the PPP. Evidence of interest shown to date suggests that a very competitive tendering process can be expected and this, of course, will also influence the costs. Commencement of work on the project will also be influenced by factors such as: public consultation on the route alignment selected; negotiation and conclusion of the PPP contract; and the independent public inquiry required under legislation before the railway order granting planning permission for any major railway works can be granted. These issues will not arise until after Government has considered my proposals.

With regard to the Sligo and Donegal routes, I would refer the Deputies to the press statement issued by me on 30 January 2003.In accordance with that press statement, officials in my Department are currently organising a rapid tender process for the provision of PSO services on these two routes for the rest of the year, pending the development of more permanent arrangements. The objective, as set out in my statement is to complete this tender process and procure the restoration of air services on these two routes within a period of four to five weeks.

It appears, in the first instance, to be a matter of contract between the relevant airline involved and the individual passengers concerned. The question of refunds in circumstances where cancellation of travel arrangements is initiated by the consumer or where the consumer does not show up for the flight, is a matter to be determined in accordance with the terms of the contract between the traveller and the airline concerned. The booking conditions set out on carriers' websites normally set out the conditions attaching to the contract including the circumstances in which moneys paid are refundable or not. I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs is considering this matter in the light of comments made at the meeting on Tuesday last 28 January 2003 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.

Some projects will, however, run beyond the time limit of the plan but it is not possible to identify them at this stage as completion of the NDP programme will be dependent on funding levels and the prevailing budgetary and economic situation over the coming years.The 2003 Estimates for my Department show the significant investment that is being made in the provision of transport infrastructure and clearly demonstrates the Government's strong ongoing commitment to the NDP programme and to maintaining a high level of investment in infrastructural projects. A review of the NDP will be undertaken in the current year taking into account the national spatial strategy and prevailing economic conditions.

The RPA have set a target date of 2005 for commencement of smartcard ticketing involving all public transport operators in the greater Dublin area.In advance of the introduction of a smartcard system in 2005, both the RPA and Dublin Bus are in discussion about bringing forward innovative ticketing for use when Luas is launched next year. I understand that the RPA will present proposals on this matter later this year. The CIE operating companies are also looking at means of promoting the greater use of combined bus and rail services on existing services. In the 2003 Estimates for my Department, €3.6 million was allocated for integrated ticketing.

Penalty points will be applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved by the end of 2003. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.It would be premature to draw any firm conclusions as to the overall effectiveness of the system at this early stage. However, preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of November and December 2002 show that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the number of detections for speeding offences. There was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that two-month period when compared with the same period in 2001, 46 in 2002, 77 in 2001. This welcome reduction in fatalities has continued into 2003. Provisional figures for January 2003 show 21 road deaths compared to 36 in January 2002. The statistical data available from this early operational period for the system suggests that the core objective of improving driver behaviour through the deployment of penalty points is being achieved.The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both of those organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 2,941 penalty point notices have issued as at 27 January 2003. This represents a small proportion of detections for speeding since 31 October last as persons have up to 56 days to pay a fixed charge notice and penalty points can only be applied to a licence record where a fixed charge has been paid or the offender has been convicted.

On 19 November 2002 the Government approved the establishment, initially on a non-statutory basis, of the office of the national taxi regulator. It is envisaged that the office of the national taxi regulator will be established on a non-statutory basis as soon as possible in 2003 pending the drawing up of formal legislative proposals that I will bring to Government in the near future. Preparation of these legislative proposals is well advanced in my Department.Subject to the enactment of legislation, it is envisaged that the office of the regulator will have a national focus and will have full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient and customer-friendly service by all small public service vehicles, including taxis, hackneys and limousines. This will include the overall application of standards for drivers, licence holders and for vehicles. It is also envisaged that the functions of the office of the regulator will include: the design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with Government decisions on the matter; the setting of national taxi licence and related fees; the setting of standards for drivers, driver training, requirements for entry; the licensing of small public service vehicle drivers following consultation with An Garda Síochána; the setting of standards, guidelines and parameters for (a) the designation and alteration of taximeter areas, (b) the setting of maximum taxi fares, and (c) the provision and designation of taxi ranks and associated bye-laws; the setting of standards for taxi, hackney and limousine vehicles and the implementation of the proposed wheelchair accessible taxi policy; and the setting of standards for customer service and for meeting the needs of people with disabilities.

The depot at Red Cow is now complete and the 26 trams for the Tallaght line have been delivered. Construction of the Sandyford depot is complete, fitting out will begin shortly and the 14 trams for this line will begin arriving in the coming weeks. Almost all enabling works, such as utilities diversions and bridge building are complete and the land and property acquisitions programme is well advanced. As of now, over 11 kilometres of track have been laid and the test tracks at Red Cow and at Sandyford are in place.Responsibility for the day to day management of the Luas project rests with the Railway Procurement Agency and the detail of individual contracts is a matter for the agency. I understand from the RPA, however, that the contractual completion dates for both lines will not be met on time and that the contractor involved has indicated that a 16 week delay can be expected. Accordingly, the RPA is in negotiation with the contractor as regards the consequences of these delays. This means that the Tallaght to Connolly Station line will be completed in February 2004 and the Sandyford to St. Stephens Green line in April 2004. A period of up to three months will be required following these dates for testing, commissioning and general safety checking before passenger services commence. I have conveyed my concerns about the delays to the RPA and I have asked that all of the necessary steps are taken to ensure that services commence at the earliest possible date.The initial budget submitted to the Department by CIE for the project was €466 million in 1999 prices, based on preliminary estimates. This budget was subsequently revised in February 2001 to €675 million to take account of actual competition tender prices received, reflecting high inflation in the construction sector and changes to the scope of the project, including the ramp at Connolly Station and the provision for upgrading line B to metro status. Capital funding for construction of the lines, estimated currently at €691 million, is in place and the RPA have also made provision for risk.

In advancing the restructuring of the CIE over the next few weeks, I will be establishing a restructuring implementation group, including representatives from the Department of Finance, my Department, CIE and its three operating subsidiaries, to take forward the detailed administrative and legislative groundwork necessary to give effect to restructuring.The starting point will be the consultancy report into the technical and financial implications of a proposed restructuring of the CIE companies. The report highlights that a number of key issues, including the treatment of debt, claims liability, pensions and property allocation will determine the success of the restructuring. No final decisions have been taken on dealing with these issues as yet. It will be a matter for the restructuring implementation group to address these issues and ensure the effective implementation of the restructuring. It is not possible for me to put an exact cost on the restructuring of CIE. However, given the constraints on the Exchequer it would be my intention to conduct the restructuring without imposing any great additional cost burden on either the Exchequer or the CIE group. The level of accumulated debt in CIE was €224.8 million at 31 December 2001.

That study, though published in 1998, was based on 1996 data and a modest design standard. Nevertheless it provided for the upgrading of these five routes to motorway or dual carriageway standard to a substantial degree.Having regard to developments since 1996, the views of economic and regional development interests, and the importance of high quality inter-urban road links between the main urban centres in supporting economic and social development, and achieving more balanced regional development the Government decided to provide for the upgrading of these five key routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard in their entirety. The individual road development projects involved will, as part of the detailed planning and design process applicable to all major road projects, be subject to assessment and evaluation, including cost/benefit analysis, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the approval and management of capital projects.

This will provide for an upgrade in the power supply and platform extensions to allow the operation of eight-car DART trains. I also approved Exchequer investment to facilitate the acquisition of 36 new additional DART cars. These are in addition to the 38 new DART cars already delivered and in service since 2000. On completion in 2005 of the DART upgrade project, it will result in a 100% increase in capacity since 2000.Iarnród Éireann are currently in discussions with my Department regarding the works required to upgrade the signalling system in the Dublin city centre area. While no specific proposals were made to me in relation to the tendering process, I understand from the company that this project gives rise to operational and technical resource issues within Iarnród Éireann which are currently being addressed. It is hoped that work could commence during 2004 which would provide the scope for additional increase in capacity in the system.

Between them, I understand that some 80 new transport services have been established to date under the RTI.Some €6 million will have been spent on the RTI by the end of this year when the pilot initiatives are due to conclude. An inter-departmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, commissioned a study in 2001 to examine options for the development of a rural public transport policy and I hope to publish the study shortly. I expect that the study and the ongoing review of the RTI, will provide the basis for bringing forward proposals for a rural transport policy next year in keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government.

Sections of the Act that relate both directly and indirectly to the operation of penalty points were commenced with effect from 31 October 2002 to facilitate the operation of that system in respect of speeding offences.In addition to the sections relating directly to the penalty points system – sections 2 to 7 – those sections relating to the introduction of a fixed charge system to replace the current on the spot fine system – section 11 – increases in the general penalties – section 23 – and the extension of the use of electronic equipment for the detection of offences – section 21 – were also commenced with effect from 31 October 2002.The requirement for full and provisional licence holders to carry their licence as set out in section 18 of the Act, and a provision that local authorities can make arrangement for the functions conferred on traffic wardens to be carried out by persons employed by the authority, or persons authorised in writing to perform those functions – section 12(2) – have been commenced since 1 January 2003.Section 15 empowers local authorities to decide on the number and location of taxi stands and to govern their operation. This responsibility was previously vested in the Garda commissioner with the consent of the Minister. I have signed a commencement order bringing this section into operation with effect from 1 February 2003. The extension of the operation of the penalty points system to all of the offences listed in the First Schedule of the Act will be pursued with a view to applying the penalty points system fully by the end of 2003. The necessary preparatory work to facilitate commencement of the remaining sections of the Act is under way in my Department in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the local authorities.

The main elements of my proposals for regulation of bus services in the greater Dublin area are as follows: as Minister for Transport, I will continue to set overall regulatory policy and approve the broad public transport investment strategy for the greater Dublin area; within that regulatory and investment framework, I will establish an independent body to procure and regulate public transport services and allocate current and capital funding for specific purposes from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer; I do not intend to deregulate the bus market in the greater Dublin area. Instead I propose to introduce controlled competition in the form of franchising. This will begin with new services and will be extended on a phased basis to the existing service network in the greater Dublin area. I would like to see the first phase of franchising commence at the beginning of 2004, with up to 25% of the mar ket being franchised out in that year, and with annual progress thereafter; long distance commuter services serving the greater Dublin area will also be procured and regulated by the independent regulatory body; the regulatory body will be given responsibility for regulating public transport fares and setting and enforcing quality standards for public transport services.These proposals took particular account of the views expressed by the public transport partnership forum. In my statement to the forum, I made it clear that it was my intention to deal with the reform programme on a basis of partnership and consultation. Since then, I have had discussions with representatives of the CIE unions and also with the CIE board and the boards of the subsidiary companies and I intend to progress the implementation of the reform programme in this consultative manner. Following a lengthy meeting I had with the trade unions yesterday, it was agreed that bilateral discussions would continue.

Significant elements of the strategy are now being delivered under the national development plan with priority being given to: increasing capacity on the suburban rail system through expanding capacity of the DART system. By 2005, there will have been a 100% increase in the capacity of the system compared with 2000. With 80 diesel railcars coming into service this year there will have been an increase of 130% in the capacity of suburban services on the Kildare line while services on the Maynooth line and suburban services on the northern line will also have been increased; the provision of the Luas light rail system which is scheduled to commence services in 2004; increasing the capacity of the bus fleet of Dublin Bus. This has been increased steadily and an increased of 23% in peak hour capacity has been provided. In addition, Bus Éireann has increased the capacity by approximately 40% on the main commuter services into Dublin; capacity improvements to N7; and introduction of quality bus corridors.Over the coming years there will be further increases in the capacity of the bus system, suburban rail services and the Luas, while the metro proposal is currently under consideration. The national development plan provides for investment of more than €2 billion in public transport and traffic management in Dublin in the period to 2006, including provision of more than €250 million in respect of traffic management grants. Nearly €2 billion will be invested in roads in the Dublin region. This represents total investment of almost €4 billion over the life of the national development plan.Major road projects to a total value of approximately €1.4 billion are currently under construction in the Dublin city and county area including the second bridge on the M50, south-eastern motorway, Dublin port tunnel and M1 – Cloghran-Balbriggan. These and other major road projects in the greater Dublin area including the N11 – Glen of the Downs and N7 – Kildare bypass are due for completion over the next two years or so. In addition to the large number of projects under way, the majority of the remaining national road projects provided for in Platform for Change are well advanced in planning and will proceed to construction as quickly as possible having regard to the funding available.

During that meeting I recalled to the board the previous Government's decision in October 2001 to facilitate private sector and staff investment in the company to support its future development provided the survival plan was fully implemented.I stated that as the company moves into a new phase and as agreement has been reached with the unions on the summary terms of a proposed new employee share ownership plan, the time was approaching to assess the future options for the airline, taking account of the previous Government's decision.Since that meeting further progress has been made in relation to the ESOP with SIPTU members accepting the terms in a recent ballot. IMPACT members accepted the ESOP when agreeing to the survival plan as amended by the Labour Relations Commission.It will be necessary to enact primary legislation to provide the legal basis for the ESOP. I propose to introduce an Aer Lingus Bill to provide for the establishment of the ESOP.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The primary consideration of the Government in establishing the redress scheme was to provide justice for people who had been abused in childhood while in residential or insti tutional care and to provide an equitable scheme through which victims could seek redress. The decision to set up the scheme was taken regardless of whether the religious congregations would make a contribution to the scheme. However, the participation of the religious congregations was a Government policy goal because it considered their participation would present an opportunity to bring closure to the issue of past abuse for Irish society as a whole and provide a basis for healing for victims.It is difficult to put an estimate on the cost to the State. However, the best estimate available prior to the introduction of the redress scheme was €400 million to €500 million based on 4,000 claimants receiving an average award of €100,000 to €125,000. The redress board's awards are based on a study and report of an expert group under the chairmanship of a senior counsel. The group specifically sought to place the awards structure within the context of likely awards of the High Court. The board may make awards of up to €300,000. While it is expected that awards will not in general exceed €300,000, the board has the capacity to award a further 20% as a form of aggravated damages and a further 10% for ongoing medical expenses. As the board may accept applications for a period of three years from the date of establishment final costs to the State cannot be calculated at this time.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

I am informed by the board that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management of these fisheries. I understand that the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board-controlled fisheries, on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species, on the same water, was not charged. As this is an operational matter, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to address the particular queries raised by the Deputy and to reply directly to him in the matter.

At the time I was informed of the difficulties which the company had experienced and the delays which resulted. The company has since indicated that  one million items of mail, which were due for delivery before Christmas, were delayed and not delivered until early January.Most of these items were Christmas cards. Business mail was at all times prioritised and the usual level of service for this time of year was maintained for these customers. The major difficulties arose within the catchment area of the Dublin mails centre which handled 80 million items of mail during the Christmas period. The main reason for the delay in deliveries was due to operational changes at the Dublin mails centre. An Post has given an assurance that these delays will not be repeated. The Commission for Communications Regulation, which has statutory responsibility for the quality of service to customers within the reserved area, has also requested a report from An Post on this matter.

The SLÁN survey showed that 10% of our adult population were obese. By 2001 this had risen to 18% as indicated by The North-South Ireland Food Consumption Survey, conducted by Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance. This gave evidence of a trend towards an increase in obesity. With regard to eating out this survey also showed that up to 25% of total food consumption comes from food and drink taken outside the home, rising to 33% in 18-35 year olds.A further national health and lifestyle survey, SLÁN, was conducted in 2002, the results of which are due in April-May of this year. The Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, is also conducting more detailed research on the incidence of food consumed outside the home, the results of which are due in the autumn of this year. These surveys will give an indication of trends in obesity and the extent of food consumed outside the home.In that context, I have no plans to conduct a specific study on the impact of fast foods on health until my Department have considered the results of the second national health and lifestyle survey, SLÁN, and the further IUNA research on eating out. However, obesity, which is a risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers, is not caused by diet alone as reported by the international obesity task force and the European Association for the Study of Obesity. In its report, Obesity in Europe – The Case For Action, they describe an obesogenic environment as one which restricts physical activity and stimulates high food energy intake. My Department is currently considering the recommendations of this report.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	647	The position is that the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts give explicit powers to the VHI board in relation to determining the nature of the cover to be provided under its health insurance products for the treatment and care of members. Similarly, the regulatory framework covering health insurance business generally provides for insurers to determine the nature of, and manner in which, benefits for the treatment of members under their plans are provided. This is subject to providing a specified minimum level of benefit, mainly relating to in-patient services. As Minister for Health and Children I do not have a statutory or administrative role in such determinations by insurers in relation to their plans, provided cover complies with the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts and related regulations.

The appointment of members to these bodies is set out in the relevant legislation. Non-governmental organisations my apply to my Department for a grant from the health and children allocation of national lottery funds. The total amount available for this purpose in 2003 is €3.533 million. I would like to inform the Deputy that there is a set protocol in place for processing applications for national lottery grants. A standard application form, signed by either the chairperson, secretary or treasurer of the organisation, must be completed. When an application is received in my Department it is registered in the finance unit and forwarded to the relevant services division for their assessment, evaluation and recommendation. All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendation and the overall level of funds available. The procedures relating to the payment of any grant requires that the relevant tax reference number or charitable status, CHY, number must be quoted on the application form. In the event that an organisation has not been granted charitable recognition a current tax clearance certificate must be provided prior to the payment of a grant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	649	My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the cardio vascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy. A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public. However, in light of the recommendations that have been made to me I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders only. Evidence shows that the lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. Accordingly, it is considered that this group are in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit.

However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The current rates are €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50, depending on the dependancy of that person, be it medium, high or maximum. Apart from contracts entered into under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Article 22.4 also permits the health board to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention, in cases where, for example, personal funds are exhausted. There are currently 500 people in the Southern Health Board in receipt of such enhanced subventions, with a further 526 people waiting for their applications to be assessed. Each health board has to fund each application for subvention and enhanced subvention from the budget assigned to it by my Department.In 1994, the first full year of the scheme, it cost €15.192 million to run the scheme. This year the cost of the scheme is over €110 million. In 2003, the Southern Health Board received an extra €1.054 million to meet the additional pressures on the scheme. As responsibility for the administration of the nursing home subvention scheme in Cork rests with the Southern Health Board, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the individual case raised by the Deputy and reply directly to him.

The major investment being undertaken in the national roads programme is assisting local authorities to improve management of traffic in towns and villages by removing through traffic. Over the past five years a substantial number of towns around the country including, for example, Nenagh, Portlaoise, Roscrea, Balbriggan, Cavan, Donegal, Arklow have been bypassed with obvious benefits. Major projects are either under way or well advanced in planning to bypass, for example, Kildare, Youghal, Ennis, Carrickmacross, Sligo and Monasterevin. The full implementation in the years ahead of the national roads programme provided for in the national development plan will remove through traffic from more than 60 more towns and villages.Investment in national roads is being complemented by a sustained high level of investment in the non-national roads programme overseen by the Minister for Environment and Local Government. This programme includes a regional traffic management grants scheme focused on improving traffic management in towns throughout the country.

Further capacity will be added when some of the 80 new diesel railcars, the first batch of which was delivered recently, are introduced on the route later this year.I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that the Arrow services on the South Kildare route serving Hazelhatch and Sallins are currently at full capacity. However, the length of trains will be increased later this year from six to eight carriage trains and the platforms at these stations are currently being extended to accommodate this. In addition, a turnback facility is being provided at Newbridge station to facilitate the improved operation of commuter trains.These works combined with the entry into service of the new railcars will result in an increase in excess of 100% in commuter capacity on the south Kildare line later this year.

The regulations provide for some extension to the upper age limit for applicants with certain specified service in the Defence Forces.Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 provides, inter alia, that those parts of the Act relating to discrimination on the age ground do not apply to employment in the Garda Síochána.On 27 November, 2000, Council Directive 2000/78/EC was adopted establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The implementation of the directive will have implications for the age provision of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. My Department is currently formulating legislative proposals to implement the Council Directive and any implications for admission to the Garda Síochána will be considered in that context.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	677	All applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended and in particular having due regard to the definition of a "refugee" in section 2 of that Act which states that a "refugee" is a person "who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it" .The Deputy will be aware that following the full commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for refugee status at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers appeals from negative recommendations of the Commissioner.Decisions on asylum applications are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon receipt of the recommendation-decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.While it would be inappropriate to comment on individual countries, in considering all asylum applications consideration is given to the subjective and objective elements of the application. The subjective element of an asylum application concerns the applicant's individual circumstances as they are perceived and described by him or her. The objective element of the application concerns the relevant country of origin information which comes from a wide variety of sources including information from organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, the US State Department, Canadian boards of immigration and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources. In addition to these periodically updated sources, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the refugee appeals tribunal have access to up to date news reports regarding events and developments in the countries concerned.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	679	The Irish Prison Service placed public advertisements in October 2001 seeking suitable sites for the location of a juvenile detention facility for young offenders aged 16 to 17 years, as part of the process of implementing the Children Act 2001. The Act provides that boys and girls aged 16 to 17 years who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence should be accommodated in separate detention facilities.On foot of these advertisements, submissions regarding 25 properties were received by the Prison Service. In addition, another 15 or so sites in state ownership, including all existing prison properties, were considered giving a total of approximately 40 locations assessed with detailed feasibility studies completed by the Office of Public Works.

Dealing No. D1997XS006276J refers.I am further informed that the latest queries, which issued to the lodging solicitors on 10 July, 2001, were replied to in December, 2002.I understand that due to the complicated nature of these type of cases, which require examination of an applicant's entitlement to the property concerned, it is not possible to estimate a date of completion at this time. However, I assure the Deputy that the dealing is receiving attention and will be completed as soon as possible.

This provision applies to any marriage solemnised in the State, irrespective of where the spouses or either of them are or is ordinarily resident, and to a marriage outside the State if, at the time of the solemnisation of the marriage, the spouses or either of them are or is ordinarily resident in the State. The High Court or Circuit Court may, however, grant an exemption from the age requirement.The issue of the minimum age of marriage is among those which are to be considered by an interdepartmental committee on marriage law under the chairmanship of the Department of Health and Children. This committee is due to engage in a public consultation shortly.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	684	Local authorities  already have comprehensive powers to manage and dispose of their land holdings.Where a local authority has acquired land which is designated as open space, whether as a condition of planning permission or otherwise, the local authority is empowered under section 211 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to dispose of that land where it no longer requires the land for its own functions, or if the disposal would secure the best use of the land or the carrying out of works necessary for the proper planning or sustainable development of the area. If the price, rent or other consideration received in exchange is not the best reasonably obtainable, the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is normally required for the disposal to proceed.However, Article 206 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provides that the consent of the Minister need not be obtained where, for social or economic reasons, the members of the local authority decide that it is reasonable to dispose of the land other than for the best reasonably obtainable consideration. The manager must prepare a report setting out the economic or social reasons which apply in relation to the disposal of land.Where it is proposed to use land designated as open space for another purpose, the change of use would of course be subject to the planning code. Consideration would have to be given as to whether the new use was in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and the provisions of the development plan.As the existing powers of local authorities to dispose of land are comprehensive, I have no proposals to amend the legislation.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I consider that the terms of the present tenant purchase scheme strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of existing tenants to own their own homes and the housing needs of those on the local authority waiting lists. While I have no proposals, at this stage, to amend the terms of the current scheme, I am keeping them under continuing review.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	691	Part 15 of the Local Government Act, 2001 provides a new ethical framework for local government employees and councillors and came into effect on 1 January 2003. This part updates a system of declaration of interests and a public register which has operated since the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976.Relevant employees and councillors are obliged to furnish an annual declaration form of their declarable interests and this process is currently under way in local authorities. My attention has been drawn to concerns of certain officials working in sensitive areas, from a security point of view, in relation to the inclusion of their home address in the public register and I am having this matter examined.

When this issue has been resolved, consideration will then be given to further grant aiding the organisation.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The national committee on volunteering was established on 21 November 2000 as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with the dual tasks of marking the 2001 UN International Year of the Volunteer in Ireland and devising strategies and actions for supporting volunteering. As part of its terms of reference the committee was asked to examine and make recommendations and report to Government on: the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering. The national committee published its report Tipping the Balance on 16 October 2002.Tipping the Balance is an extremely detailed and comprehensive report covering many aspects of volunteering. The report contains wide-ranging recommendations which impact on many state and other bodies. Its major recommendations relate to the development of a national policy on volunteering and the establishment of a volunteering support and development infrastructure.Given the complexity of issues covered in Tipping the Balance and the wide-reaching implications associated with its recommendations, a thorough examination of the report is required. The process of examination and consideration is now under way in my Department.

While different criteria apply across such measures, none of these schemes-programmes are designed to fund organisations the membership of which is secret or unknown.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-05 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The position is that community employment, which currently operates under the aegis of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is subject to a review at senior official level in which my Department is represented.

This includes LEADER and other measures in Peace II and INTERREG III. These programmes are co-funded with the EU and with the exception of Peace II, which expires in 2004, will run to 2006 with the bulk of expenditure expected in the second half of the programmes i.e. 2004-2006. I am satisfied that the 2003 allocations are sufficient to meet this year's commitments and I intend that sufficient matching funding will be provided for the remaining years of these programmes.

These language assistants provide help for those children who do not have a sufficient knowledge of the Irish language to enable them to fully participate in the school curriculum, which is through Irish. This scheme, which is financed from resources allocated to my Department specifically for Gaeltacht areas, is at present under review although it is not intended at this stage to extend the scheme outside of the Gaeltacht. I might also point out that the Department of Education and Science has confirmed that a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio applies to Gaelscoileanna outside the Gaeltacht than to Gaeltacht schools.

A list of the voluntary organisations and the grants which they received is available from the Oireachtas library.There are currently 86 local family resource centres receiving funding under the family resource centre programme for which some €5 million was provided in 2002.My Department also provides grants to support "second chance" education opportunities and other initiatives to assist long-term unemployed people to return to work. Six organisations are involved in training and education initiatives and over 160 small projects provide support to unemployed people throughout the country were assisted with grants totalling €2.2 million in 2002.My Department also provides core funding for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights services.

Organisations which apply for financial assistance are required to submit full details regarding the organisation and its work together with details of accounts and any other funding which they receive.Where appropriate, organisations are also required to supply evidence of compliance with Government tax clearance procedures.
