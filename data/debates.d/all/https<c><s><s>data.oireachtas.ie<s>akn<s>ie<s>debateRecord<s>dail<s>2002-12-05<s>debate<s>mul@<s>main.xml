In his absence, the Tánaiste advised us that it is not possible to say when the prison services Bill scheduled for 2003 would be taken. She said it was not possible to say when the ground rents Bill would be published as was the case with several other Bills. There is a paucity of legislation before the House and there is no legislation to go to committees. What is the point in circulating the legislative programme for the autumn if there is no legislation? Does the document have any status? Can Deputies on this side of the House rely on it being a schedule and a planned programme of legislation to be brought before the House?</p>

The National Tourism Development Authority Bill has been published. On the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, I explained that further consultation was taking place with the groups. We could publish it but it is better to have the consultation. There are two Bills under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which are not yet ready. Under the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency legislation is not yet available.

          <p eId="para_188">This is the budget the country needs at the present time. While not without some pain, it is a fair and progressive budget that looks after those who are least well off. It seeks some contribution from everyone else, especially those sectors that have prospered most in recent years. The Government is determined to maintain a strong economy for the benefit of all our people. This budget will send out a message of confidence at home and abroad that we are determined to remain on top of the situation, despite the further deterioration in the world economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The positive features of the budget in this regard are: a modest general Government borrowing requirement of 0.7% of GDP in 2003 after achieving near balance in 2002 and a continued drop in the GGB to GNP debt ratio to 34%, the second lowest in the European Union after Luxembourg; the lower personal tax rates achieved by the last Government are maintained and the move to the unified corporate tax rate of 12.5% has been completed on schedule; and there is no deviation from the target amount set aside for future pension liabilities or modification of the special savings investment account scheme, despite the siren voices. The lack of provision for future pensions is a serious problem, particularly in some European Union economies. We are maintaining one of the highest public investment ratios in the European Union with an extra 20% being provided for roads, compared with the Abridged Book of Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I regard it as a great achievement in these times that we can still look forward to a net increase in employment of 18,000 this year and, following the budget, 11,000 next year. Until recently, we were never anywhere near the top of any international comparative employment table. On the contrary, until 15 years ago we were bumping along the top of the unemployment league in the company of Spain. One only needs to look around Europe, both now and in the past, or at the former Asian tigers to see how quickly economic reputations built up painstakingly over a long period can be undone if the right action is not taken in good time.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The point may be made by some that we could use more room for manoeuvre under the Stability and Growth Pact to borrow more. I have no desire to see this country under the sort of pressure we faced in the past or some of our partners are under today in struggling to achieve acceptable deficits, nowadays defined as below 3% of GDP. There are many uncertainties in the world economy, not least the uncertainty over Iraq, and our aim must be to get through this period with minimum disruption and in a strong position to resume higher growth as soon as external conditions improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">In real terms, there is no reduction in Government expenditure. In fact, there is likely to be a modest real increase and gross current expenditure is set to grow by 8.7%. All talk of savage cutbacks is simply ignoring the figures. Besides, nearly every sector has benefited from huge increases over the past five years, in many cases of 80% to 100% or more. The tighter current situation in which spending is levelling off on a high plateau will be an incentive to ensure concentration on the essentials and the more important priorities, rather than to behave as if money were no object.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The budget has to be understood in the context of two key facts, the difficult economic circumstances we face domestically and internationally in the short-term and the need to manage our way through the coming period of uncertainty. We should be poised to take best advantage of the upturn as soon as it comes in order that we can, at all times, fully protect the position of the weaker members of society. The budget meets these two imperatives. It strikes the right balance between social protection for today's people and needs and investment to underpin and secure our economic prospects into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">We are one of the most open economies in the world. We must protect our competitiveness and astutely plan to regain better competitive advantage if we are to secure future economic growth, job creation and social justice. It is the very open nature of our economy, combined with stability orientated domestic policies, that has driven the exceptional economic growth of recent years, most notably over the period 1997 to 2000. With the global economic downturn and the slowdown in our economic growth last year and into this year, the Government has had to take stock. We have had to take unpalatable measures to bring the public finances into line with the economic reality and protect our future prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">In formulating the budget for next year, the Government has been guided by the need to ensure levels of public spending are appropriate to actual and projected economic growth which, in turn, affects revenue levels. In other words, spending increases for next year have to be brought into line with changes in tax revenue. This is precisely what is being done through the Estimates and now in the budget. It is especially important to make the point that corrective action to account for the uncertainties we face next year will help us achieve the vital goal of consolidating the important and unprecedented economic and social gains of recent years. Without such action, we would risk rapidly eroding all that has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">In formulating the Estimates, the recommendations of an independent review committee informed the decision making process. I am grateful to those who gave of their time. It is the job of the Government, however, to evaluate choices and make final decisions, taking all factors into consideration. Everyone can see which suggestions have been adopted. The proposals which have not been taken on board do not have the status of an agenda for Government, but are available for anyone to consult or debate. The very large spending increases of recent years led to a big expansion in services and capital investment in many priority areas. While the rate of increase could not be sustained indefinitely, it was a justifiable part of our economy in a rapid catch-up phase. The sheer level of these increases are an important fact against which any outcry about the moderation of spending in the Estimates and the budget must be judged. On average, Departments and agencies are spending at least 40% more on services to the public than they did two years ago. That is not, necessarily, the same as saying that we have seen a 40% increase in the quality or quantity of services. It is reasonable, therefore, to look critically at where taxpayers' money is going and at whether our structures and delivery mechanisms are giving us the best possible value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Taking into account that the base expenditure figure on public services is some 40% higher than it was two years ago, the Government has had to make decisions about where resources are to be prioritised in the current very different circumstances. In line with our overall objective to improve the general quality of life and raise national competitiveness, priority is being given to health, education, social welfare and transport infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">There is a very substantial social inclusion package in this budget, costing €500 million. We are maintaining our commitment to the older section of our population with a €10 increase, with a similar increase of €11 for widows and widowers on the contributory pension. This is broadly the same level of increase as was given last year, and is comfortably in excess of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">In considering what has been done for our older people, we have given another substantial increase in the age exemption limit from €26,000 to €30,000 for a married couple, as well as some further improvements in the carer's allowance, the respite care grant, and the extension of the free telephone allowance to residents of nursing homes who have their own telephone account.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">We have also provided a further increase of between €8 and €10 a month in child benefit this year, even if not on the scale of the spectacular increase last year. Of all the improvements made in recent years, those in pensions and child benefit have been particularly appreciated by the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">With regard to health, the gross allocation for next year will be €8.9 billion, an increase of €520 million on 2002. That rise needs to be set within the context of a massive 147% cumulative increase over the period 1997 to 2003. Of itself, that represents a clear demonstration of the Government's consistent commitment and determination to bring about a marked and substantial improvement in health care provision. However, the health delivery agencies have a vital role to play too, especially in the effective management of resources on behalf of patients and those on waiting lists, as well as on behalf of taxpayers generally. We will make further progress in extending the medical card as soon as possible, but I remind the House our pledge is to be implemented over a whole term of government, and not necessarily in the first year.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">In the area of education, the gross allocation for 2003 of €5.6 billion represents a €190 million increase on 2002 and brings the cumulative rise over the period 1997 to 2003 to 77%. This includes a threefold increase in capital spending. While teachers are the most important educational resource, continued investment in school buildings, to bring them up to the best modern standards, is a high priority for the Government. I look forward to public private partnership projects making a significant contribution in this regard. I welcome the proposals of the Minister for Education for improved transparency from the beginning of next year as to where each school building project is at.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">On social welfare, the gross allocation for the Department of Social and Family Affairs has now risen to nearly €10.2 billion. This is an increase of €800 million or a bit over 8% on last year. Overall spending on social welfare has increased by €4.5 billion since 1997, despite the halving in unemployment from 10% to less than 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">This allocation of scarce resources demonstrates the Government's commitment to accord special priority to those sections in our society who are most marginalised or most vulnerable; those in need of health care, those depending on social welfare payments for their incomes, as well as those who will drive economic and social performance in the years ahead – people giving and receiving education. In principle, we have close to full employment, and, generally speaking, taking up employment opportunities which are available or accessible from most parts of the country, is the best cure for low incomes, as far as anyone in the labour force is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Having regard to the limiting effects on economic activity of accumulated under investment, €5.5 billion will now be invested next year in capital projects. By any objective reckoning, and in particular by previous standards, that is major expenditure. It is almost twice the equivalent rate for the EU generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Next year, €1.7 billion will be spent on capital investment in transport, €1 billion on housing, a further €1 billion on health and education capital projects and more than €470 million on environmental services. The extra €209 million for the national roads programme announced in the budget represents a large increase on the outturn for this year, and will allow a number of new projects to be started. Of particular importance is that a significant easing in construction price inflation presents a good opportunity now to achieve better value for money deals. In the round, the allocation for capital expenditure sets a correct balance for this economy and this society, by continuing to invest at a high rate to improve the competitiveness of the economy, while, at the same time, sustaining the gains achieved in promoting greater inclusion and equality in our society. If we attempt to pour too much into the capital side, we will run into capacity constraints, drive up prices, and end up no further forward at more cost. That was our position in part of 1999 and in 2000 as well. We poured extra money into the these areas and got less in return. If logic follows, then we should get a far better return for our input next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">We have not fallen into either of the traps to which some commentators referred. We have not concentrated all our resources on day to day spending and abandoned the necessary investments in long-term infrastructure. Neither have we pursued physical capital investment programmes, regardless of the changed fiscal situation to the detriment of those people who need support today and a helping hand up to avail of the opportunities that still exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">As one would expect, the allocations to the higher priority areas have implications for other areas. This is not to say we have abandoned other objectives and important areas. It means, however, that we have to accept that progress in those other areas will be made at a more gradual pace and over a longer time scale than we might initially have hoped.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">With regard to the post-PPF talks that are under way, it is still early days yet in the talks process. Good progress has been made in clarifying the key issues involved for each of the pillars of social partnership and identifying the priority issues and areas for attention as the talks progress. Government and the social partners have had a good working relationship in the past, and I look forward to their continuation. Even though Government has to make decisions at the end of the day, and this year that has meant some tough and unpalatable ones, we have always listened to and taken account of the points made by the social partners and have sought to implement the agreements and commitments entered into, in good faith. That has stood us in good stead, and I look forward to being able to continue the good working relationship that has served our people so well.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Government side remains committed to achieving, if possible, a new partnership agreement. I look forward to continued engagement by all the social partners to achieve that objective in the coming weeks. Social partnership has yielded huge benefits and advantages to all sectors of society over the past 15 years, which are recognised inside and outside the country. The challenge for us all is how we manage our way through the current uncertainty to position ourselves to respond quickly and with agility when we turn the corner, while protecting the social gains made in recent years. Social consensus and cohesion is a big plus factor that will help us to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Our commitment to social partnership is also demonstrated by the fact that the budget includes a provision of €565 million to cover implementation of the first phase of benchmarking under any new agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Public sector numbers have increased very rapidly in recent years as part of a planned improvement in services; by 20,000 excluding health, or 33,000 including health, since September 1998, and more if one goes back further. These include 18,000 extra teachers, 24,000 extra health workers, 1,200 extra gardaí and prison officers, and nearly 5,000 administrative civil servants. The numbers employed in semi-State companies, a few of which have moved into the private sector, have declined by 6,000. In the light of these increases, the capping and reduction over three years of the total public sector by 5,000 or by 1.5% is attainable through redeployment and greater efficiency. I recognise that past experience must guide us towards a more refined system. In consultation with the public service unions we need to put systems in place which allow us to switch people to where they are most needed. At a practical level, I do not envisage any decline in the numbers of front-line staff providing priority public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">In the last Government we went to great lengths to reduce what for a long time has been perceived as an excessive burden of taxation, falling particularly heavily on employees on PAYE. Rates have been reduced to internationally competitive levels, and bands broadened, so that after the budget only 30% of those potentially subject to tax will be on the higher rate, which has been reduced to 42%. A continued increase in relief for the low paid has been given via the employee tax credit, formerly known as the PAYE allowance, and more substantial mortgage interest relief given to first-time buyers, which will go some way towards compensating for the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">We have over-indexed tax credits and bands consistently in the past few years, so the pause in this year's budget, given the difficult circumstances, will, I believe, be understood by most taxpayers. We still have a tax system that is the most benign in Europe towards the low paid and one that is competitive at almost all levels with other OECD countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">With lower personal tax rates and income growth in recent years, it should not be necessary to offer as many tax-based incentive schemes as a means of persuading our wealthier and more successful citizens to contribute their fair share to society in the most direct and efficient manner. Property investment is an even more attractive option at present and can have the effect of crowding out first-time buyers and others requiring more spacious accommodation for a growing family.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">As Minister for Finance, I greatly broadened the tax base between 1992 and 1994 but it is a job that has to be done every few years, as new schemes rise up to take the place of those that have been cut down. In any case, many development incentives only work if the Government is serious about them being time limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It would have been very unwise from a confidence point of view to delay or defer completion of the process of achieving a unified rate of corporation tax of 12.5%. To have delayed at a time of renewed European debate might have been seen as a wavering in our commitment to this, which was announced by Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance, but implemented by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government over the past four years with the agreement of the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I remind our EU partners that we have raised, not reduced, the rate of corporation tax in the international traded sector from zero up to 1981, then to 10% and now to 12.5%. Harmonising corporation tax at a high level is not the answer to the economic problems of any European country. In the United States, which has a fully federal constitution, a key part of competition between different states is their freedom to set different rates of business taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">If we want the European economy, as a whole, to be more dynamic, like the United States, we will not stifle legitimate competition or systematically remove all the freedom which enables poorer countries to catch up, particularly when the richer countries have no intention of providing extra resources to the EU for serious wealth redistribution. Legitimate competition on a transparent basis is healthy, not unfair, and large countries that in their day have experienced industrial revolutions and economic miracles should be the last to complain about fair, if unwelcome, competition from smaller and historically much poorer countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">Twenty years ago, it was a constant complaint, especially on the left and among the trade unions, that we were collecting derisory levels of capital and corporation tax. It was always one of the key issues to be trumpeted out during budget debates down through the years. In the last year of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition in 1986, £257 million was collected in corporation tax and approximately £34 million in capital taxes. This increased significantly over the next ten years during the period of national recovery but, even in the years since 1996, the yield from corporation tax has increased from €1.8 billion to more than €5 billion this year. Capital gains tax yield increased eightfold from €106 million to €859 million between 1996 and 2001, falling a little this year due to more depressed conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I accept it is difficult for people with socialist affiliations to accept that the best way to increase the yield is to drop the rate but the fact is that those people, whom some Members never cease to castigate as members of the most right-wing Government ever, have had infinitely more success in increasing the capital and corporate tax take from business and wealthy individuals than those who insisted on levying those taxes at a punitive rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">The yield from these taxes have made a huge financial contribution to improved services and infrastructure. However, one sometimes feels that some Members would prefer to go back to a 40% capital gains tax rate, as if the object of the exercise was to satisfy moralistic instincts and win political headlines, rather than actually finding a better way of collecting tax from the wealthier sections of society.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">Last night figures were being thrown out about tax yields over the years and overnight I obtained a schedule of taxes in percentage terms to address that argument. In 1996, the year before the previous Government took office, corporation and capital gains taxes contributed 12.06% to the Exchequer in comparison to 20.24% currently. That answers the argument about us being a right-wing Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">In general, we, as a Government, have avoided making damaging and even loss making tax changes, that we know would not in practice yield any additional revenue, solely for the purpose of earning brief public applause, which would stop when the detrimental effects became visible.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I began by emphasising the soundness of the budget and its real contribution to continuing confidence in the economy and I finish by emphasising its progressive and socially caring nature. The increased spending is largely made up of a social welfare package that builds further on the progress of recent years and will go some way to reducing both consistent and relative poverty. As the tax tables show, the benefits of the limited changes we are making go almost entirely to employees on lower incomes. I thought the House would have applauded last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The clawbacks and the widening of the tax base will mainly affect those on high incomes. The State is providing on a basis of fairness for its own employees but we must halt the rapid growth in numbers. Current and investment expenditure remain at a high level. Any left-wing government in Europe would have no problem introducing or standing over this redistributive budget taking from the wealthy and giving to those who are less well off, which is demonstrated by every chart and table. Such a government would be proud of and aspire to the poverty proofing result shown in the budget tables but, equally, there is nothing that a centre-right government could reasonably object to. If we can hold our confidence, Ireland remains in an enviable economic position and over the next number of budgets we will continue to implement those policies.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">That was a little like the applause I heard yesterday. In the nature of politics, there is much that is ritual and much that is reflex. I would not want anyone to believe that what I will say is just a reflex, the predictable negative noises from an Opposition leader. I do not often claim high seriousness but I do so today because the budget presented yesterday must not be seen just as another link in a chain going nowhere, as it is of much more negative significance than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">No budget is simply a bundle of taxes and borrowings instead of sums and statistics. The making of a budget creates a profoundly important hiatus in the hurried routine of politics. In any given year the budget should be read as a statement of national values and priorities. It is an opportunity to say through action, "This is what matters, this is what we value", because in microcosm that is what each couple, family and person does every year. We take our everyday needs and take account of implications of age, illness or accident, examine the hopes we have for our children, dream and take practical steps. The way two people plan their tight finances speaks volumes about their standards and the direction they want their lives to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">There is no family in this country that cannot point with pride at some risk taken, some immediate gratification foregone. There is no individual who does not remember the first or last repayment on his or her mortgage, the relief when an insurance policy is paid off and the sense that an education has been assured. How we interpret and allocate the financial ebbs and flows of our lives speaks volumes about us. It speaks to our pride, our purpose and our very self-confidence. Just as in ancient times it was possible to make a profound judgment about a man based on what he did with moneys entrusted to him, so today is it possible to judge the confidence and self-possession of large numbers of our young people who take themselves and their new degrees out of Ireland to spend a year working and winging it around Australia. These young people are filled with a confidence earlier generations lacked and a sense of competence and ability that will see them right no matter where they go. They do not have much money. In some cases they have negative equity but they do not lack vision. They know there is a time for exploration, risk taking, experimenting and short-term thinking. This is that time for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">We do not define ourselves by our financial plans but we are defined by them nonetheless. They announce to the world at any time what we believe to be fundamental, what we see as important and what we want to aim at. The annual budget, therefore, is a litmus test of a Government and a way to judge the real values of an Administration. It is the one time in the year when the Government proves what it stands for, whether it means to or not. It is a challenge and an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">This budget is more notable for what it has not said than for what it contains. It is a vivid and livid example of how soulless, gutless and bankrupt of decency and morality the Government is. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats used and abused the public purse – the people's money – to bankroll their political survival and last night the Minister for Finance revealed how the people, particularly those with no power, have been chosen to pay again. Not for this Government the open and honest route. Yet again the pain has been hidden. The Minister did not announce how much extra the ordinary taxpayer is going to pay as a result of this budget. He will not, but we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Failure to index tax credits and tax bands will cost ordinary taxpayers €502 million next year, or €400 for every household. That is one impact of this budget. This indexation was always done, even in the bad old days of the 1980s which followed the bad old days of the 1970s. We must add another €50 million for the cost of using a cheque book or credit card. Does this morally bankrupt Government expect us to believe that the financial institutions will not be able to pass on the €100 million levy to their customers, who are the ordinary citizens? It was easy for the Minister to announce that he was increasing the 12.5% VAT rate to 13.5%. It would have been harder for him to explain its impact, so he did not. This impact will be felt in every home in the country, irrespective of means. Every time the house is repaired or the washing machine or cooker needs work the householder will pay more. Every new house will cost more. Every visit to the cinema, take-away meal and ESB and telephone bill will rise. This increase, sold as 1%, is a real increase of 8% because 1% of 12.5 is 8% of 100.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">This budget was a silent killer. This blueprint puts education, the best and final escape hatch of the disadvantaged, tantalisingly and shamefully out of reach, re-invents health care as a luxury commodity and puts our infrastructure, on which the future of Ireland incorporated critically depends, in jeopardy. It is clear this is a blueprint born out of dishonesty and desperation for power at all costs. It turns social exclusion into deliberate social eviction. It guarantees, if not outright economic extinction for the weakest, at least endangered status. It leaves people on the minimum wage in the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The Minister's ego has perpetrated a farce whereby the Exchequer must borrow and pay interest on money to hand out to wealthy savers while he will not borrow to save the poor, the disabled or the needy. The budget does not merely fragment society, it shatters it. With this budget the Government has not enabled our future, it has crippled it. Therefore, I denounce it to the House and to the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The country is not in economic crisis but we have a crisis in the management of our public finances. That crisis was born of sloppy management by the Government and decisions taken in the interests of personal ego rather than the national interest. We are not in recession. We have economic growth rates nearly double those of the EU yet it has suited the Government's collective mind to bad mouth and publicy run down the state of our economy for the past two months. It suits members of the Government to say it is the global economy rather than their own apalling and inept mismanagement that is the cause of this. It suits them because if they repeat the line often enough some people will eventually believe them.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Expenditure grew by 50% in two years while revenue grew by 4%. There has been no corresponding increase in public service over the same period. Health spending has increased almost threefold since 1997. Does anyone believe there has been a threefold improvement in the service? Does anyone believe the health service has improved at all? Certainly those who are ill and must, from Tuesday, pay the first €70 of the cost of necessary medicines do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">How do the following equate with good governance? The National Development Plan is 62% over budget and two years behind schedule after three years, the cost of extending medical cards to the over 70s was underestimated by €70 million and health service employment grew by 30,000 but only 6,150 were medical professionals. After the Celtic tiger years fewer people on low means are entitled to a medical card than in 1997, children are still being taught in condemned buildings and the school building programme is, effectively, frozen. Mullingar hospital, topped out in 1997, will not be open until 2004 while Monaghan hospital is being slowly strangled. Despite numerous reviews only one in five new houses is purchased by first-time buyers. Ireland has crashed down to the bottom of the competitiveness league.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">What is worse than that sloppy mismanagement is the cost ordinary citizens are paying because the Government and the Minister have put personal ego before the national interest. It was political ego that drove the Minister to introduce two election budgets in 2001 and 2002, just to cover his political options. These two massive spending budgets drove public spending out of control and the nation into debt. How many primary schools would this have built? How many BreastCheck clinics could have been built with the €400 million wasted on the aborted national stadium? That €400 million equates to more than 1% on the standard rate of income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">It was the same need to fund this political ego in 2001 that led to the Minister taxing jobs and frightening away foreign investment by abolishing the employer's PRSI ceiling when the social insurance fund was in surplus. The Ministers ego was dented when public spending went out of control and to salve his ego he reduced spending by the back door. He abolished the first-time buyer's grant, taking away €38 million and giving back €8 million. He increased, twice, the amount the sick have to pay each month for medicines, increased the so-called registration fee for third level students by 70% and increased hospital charges and by extension VHI costs. Because he did not have the money left to invest in public transport fares went up by 15% for most passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Above all it was ego that led him to proudly announce last year that he was not going to borrow and to make his now discredited raid on the Central Bank and the social insurance fund. The raid not only fooled the people but in their arrogance the members of Government believed it themselves. They believed it and built a fraudulent political programme on that economic house of cards last June. That series of promises is in tatters after yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">What is the real impact of this gutless and soulless budgetary process? This budget and these Estimates condemn our people to a thousand little cuts in every aspect of their lives, which the Government will neither acknowledge nor admit. Local authority rents are up 18% and rates on businesses are up between 6% and 10% in most areas. Health insurance, service charges, transport costs, effective tax rates and parking charges have all risen. The list is endless. These are directly attributable to the Governments abuse of the public purse but it did not have the honesty or the morals to take the pain. Instead it palmed off the blame on local authorities, health boards, semi-State companies and anyone else available.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">All over the country, credibility stands suspended. Yes, we were rich. The Tánaiste told us the country was awash with money. Now, after the literal and metaphorical deluge, it is simply awash and adrift. The Government, in its own words, spent the money while we had it and now it is gone. It is a bit like the lotto millionaire now picking through the bins. He too spent it while he had it, although he was misspending his own money.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Let us be clear that this budget is not about people, responsibility or society. It is purely and simply about figures, specifically the kinds of figures that can balance the books when one has been ripping off the company. In their efforts to make up for quantum accounting, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have wiped quality of life from the landscape. To them we are no longer citizens living in a society, but statistics living in and existing for an economy. That is the essence of what is wrong. We are no longer people with histories, aspirations, needs and ideals. To a Government which has abdicated its moral duty and demonstrated repeatedly that its sole commitment is to itself, we are simply a series of numbers. How else could it have betrayed and sold out the people it was elected to serve?</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Government squandered our money first, then moved on to opportunity. This budget confirms those opportunities as dead. I would like to look at ignored opportunities in three critical areas which decide the kind of – dare I say – society in which we live. The areas are health, education and infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Regarding health, the budget provided an extra €2.8 million to pay for less than adequate increases in allowances, such as the mobility allowance and the domiciliary care allowance. In the meantime, after three mini-budgets in health in the past six months, the Government has decided that patients must pay for the misdeeds and mismanagement of Ministers. What have they to offer to the 29,000 people waiting as I speak for a bed in a hospital, the majority of them in Dublin? What will they do for St. Vincent's Hospital, where waiting lists are up by 107% on 1997? What will they do for the Mater Hospital in the Taoiseach's own constituency, where there are 5,000 people waiting to get in?</p>
          <p eId="para_251">A couple of weeks ago, the Dublin teaching hospitals took to the airwaves to declare a state of emergency. They are stating that they are bursting at the seams, locking their doors and advising people to stay at home. How will this tough medicine go down with them? While the hospitals at home are falling apart at the seams, the Government is flying people out of the country for treatment. At the same time, it is pricing people out of primary care through scandalously low income limits for medical card eligibility coupled with the enormous increases in the cost of medicines through the drugs payment scheme. What kind of perverse logic is stopping people from accessing medical care when problems first arise and forcing them back into the overcrowded and understaffed hospitals, which are already reaching crisis point? What is the price on the quality and fairness promised in the now defunct health strategy?</p>
          <p eId="para_252">While the Minister had the wealth he did not have either the will or the necessary capacity to reform the health services. His solution is to pile the pressure on the sick, those who are dependent on regular medication, those who are already struggling for medical insurance and those who cannot afford to see a doctor at any cost. Will this policy take old women off trolleys or modify the 50% of accident and emergency users who find the units unsuitable? This morning one could have seen the staff in the accident and emergency unit in St. Vincent's Hospital climbing over bodies on trolleys waiting to get into units.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Will the policy do anything to address the 173,000 bed days lost to hospitals over the past two years, 42% of them due to nursing shortages? Will it do anything for the 25,000 children who are waiting for up to eight years for public orthodontic care? We have yet to clarify how the cap on public service recruitment will affect an already understaffed health service. Will this cap mean less junior doctors, nurses, radiographers, speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists? If it does, we may all book our flights out of the country to seek health care abroad because our own health service is barely holding together.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">What about education? Education is about enablement. It enables our children to face the challenges and seize the opportunities the world provides. It is a way of protecting the weak and it challenges us to elevate the disadvantaged. No sooner was the Government back in power than it initiated a new social contract with the disadvantaged. It axed €11 million from schemes to keep them in the system. At a stroke, it committed them, perhaps forever, to a life best described by the subjunctive, "if only".</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The budget did nothing for the 800 children who never make it past primary level. It did nothing for the 19% who never make it to the leaving certificate. What will it do for the 100 primary schools whose daily timetable could well include, in some cases, an up-close and personal study of the habits of the rat? It will do nothing because there was no extra money allocated for education.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I fail to understand how the Minister for Education and Science can preside over the fact that over 400 schools are now at a standstill. There are two things that make any nation tick, health and education. Any Minister or Government that reneges on them should be absolutely ashamed. Remember that the Government has already taken the hatchet to capital projects for primary schools. What will this round of spending do for parents who dread sending their children off to learn in schools the likes of which one would not find even in the far reaches of Albania? All over the country people are sending school books to Africa under the Trócaire Christmas giving scheme. If this trend continues that kind of charity might just have to begin at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">After this budget, Trinity College will not exactly be bracing itself for an onslaught of students from Kilbarrack and Killinarden. Even before yesterday, student registration fees were already up 70% and access programmes, designed to get students from these backgrounds into third level, had been cut. The Government has added yesterday's insult to the serious injury of 24% cuts in capital funding for our universities and 33% cuts in capital projects for our institutes of technology. It calls this investing in the future, protecting the weak and alleviating disadvantage. If the Minister for Education and Science does not understand that the future of job creation is through innovation, patenting and research and development, then the co-operation and support necessary for our third level colleges and institutes of technology will be of no avail. The Government's response in this budget is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The future is very uncertain because of the dire and worsening state of our infrastructure. I am not sure what the Minister for Finance was thinking of. Infrastructure is the framework on which our economy and society is built. A lack of infrastructure leads to no inward investment, no trade, no business and no money. The infrastructural allocation in the Estimates was 11% down on last year. Dublin commuters face daily hell. This city has become a monster, sucking the national development plan funds dry. Luas is hopelessly overdue and the excavations prove it, the metro link to Dublin airport is way behind schedule and significantly over budget, and Dublin Bus is still a monopoly. It is no wonder that traffic congestion is costing the country €650 million per year or that the average traffic speed in the capital will fall to eight kilometres per hour by 2006. A road journey between here and Cork can take seven hours, a road journey between here and Waterford can take four hours and a road journey between here and Navan can take two and a half hours. What tourist or business person would want to put up with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_259">What is to happen to the 22 road schemes still awaiting finance, with no provision for them in the Book of Estimates? How does this gel with the spatial strategy? This budget has no provision to address the imbalance whereby 19 Internet data centres were due to be completed by the middle of this year in Dublin, while there were only two planned for the rest of the entire country. Is it any wonder that we have fallen to 25th place out of 30 countries in the OECD surveyed in terms of broadband access for small firms and home users? I hardly call this strategically positioning the Irish economy to make the most of the information society boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Are we now to face a future where every town and village is likely to be dug up in the next 20 years to facilitate the roll-out of broadband cable without having investigated the capacity of what wireless can deliver in a much shorter time and in a more expeditious manner with the same level of facility? There needs to be a re-examination of this area because while broadband is as necessary as electricity, there may be more expeditious ways of getting the service it provides. I am not saying it should not happen but if we are to face a 20 year programme of roll-out, that will be too little, too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The national development plan has all but collapsed as a planning document. Despite the promises made in the last two elections, what was delivered in relation to infrastructure was nothing of any significance. The roads which were built or which are under construction were those identified a decade ago. The Government has also failed to fund any new road schemes which were not in the pipeline prior to the production of the NDP. Even in the county of Kildare, the famous snail affected Kildare bypass has been delayed for years. One of the worst bottlenecks in the country at Monasterevin cannot proceed because of lack of funding. Is it not a disgrace that the National Roads Authority has identified 28 roads projects that are ready to go, with full planning permission secured, but all are held up because the Government will not approve funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Where now stands the deal made by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, the farmers' former friend, on the abolition of roll-over relief for land purchased for road projects? The Dublin Port tunnel was first mentioned in a development plan for the city in 1972, no less than 30 years ago, and it is still not ready. When it is ready, at a staggering cost of over €650 million, it will bring great relief to some of the city's commuters but it will move the traffic jam to the East Wall Road because the Macken Street bridge across the Liffey, which was to accommodate traffic from the tunnel, is postponed due to Government funding cutbacks. Another NDP star project, Luas, is again behind schedule. I have lost track of the number of statements issued about its timing and the cost of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">No waste management projects have begun since the NDP was approved. Environmental service projects in relation to water and waste water are all behind schedule because nobody, including the Government, has any real faith in the deliverability of the NDP. The national spatial strategy, which is essential for infrastructure development, inevitably will be tarred with the same brush. What has the potential to become one of the most important planning documents since the Buchanan report will meet the same fate as the NDP. It was launched with significant publicity outside this House, but it will die a death as this Government does not have either a durable plan or a clear commitment for building the country's infrastructure. Instead of having a committee examine alternative ways of raising finance, the Government should set out the priorities that can be delivered within the lifetime of the NDP and get on with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Economic policy is not just about public finances. The way we raise revenue and the priorities given in deciding how to spend those revenues define the type of nation we are, the type of society we want to become and the type of people we are. Economic management is only a means to an end. The ultimate goal is about people, their prosperity, well-being and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">This Government has forgotten that fundamental point. It treats people as tax units, participants in the workforce, numbers on waiting lists and social welfare recipients. Real people are not statistics; they are parents, children and the elderly. Some are sick, others are homeless. Some are wealthy, some are poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">In times of great prosperity, and we have just had the most prosperous period in the nation's history, we should be able to say that the weakest and the most needy benefited most yet to our shame, and to this Government's palpable shame, we cannot say that. This budget did nothing to address the damning fact that there are more homeless people, who are homeless seven nights a week, in Dublin than in London, which has ten times the population. That is an appalling problem not addressed in yesterday's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Neither this budget nor the Estimates before it cared for the sick or cherished all of our children. For the elderly, those who grafted through the awful years to build this nation, there is the trumpeted €10 per week and the daily worries to come about their cost of living, the repairs to their homes, the level of service charges and the price increases on a whole range of goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">If this budget was about people it would have concentrated not on what people have but on what people need. In a just and caring society, progress for people with disabilities would not be linked to the current economic climate. This budget proves that we do not live in a just or caring society under this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The modest improvements in income supports sought by disability groups were not just ignored, they were disregarded with disdain. What they got was a €1.92 per week increase in the respite care grant and a derisory reduction in the means test criteria for the carer's allowance, in addition to a minimum increase in disability allowance. There is no sign in this budget of a cost of disability allowance. Scandalously, the Minister is content to allow the additional cost of disability to be borne by people with disabilities. All the while, the Minister was happy to borrow to fund the €700 million cost of maintaining his ego-sustaining SSIAs.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">This budget was not about communities or sustaining them. Across the country there are small businesses, sometimes the only employer in an area, actually fighting for survival. This budget will not help them. It has hurt them by raising VAT and forcing local authorities to raise rates and service charges. It will push many of them over the edge and sound the death knell for the many communities they support.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">This budget was cynical and soulless, driven by public relations and not principles, and by politics rather than people. Two years of incompetence and mismanagement had to be corrected. It could have been corrected in ways that genuinely delivered equitable and real public service improvements. It could have started the process of reform that is so vital, but then the need for reform is only recognised when we think of our citizens as people, not statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Minister's so-called edifice of economic probity falls apart when one examines how the Government proposes to spend the people's money. Pay costs are up 11%, social welfare is up 8% and the rest of spending is up just 1% – against inflation of almost 5%. That might be sound economics to the Minister but in the real world, to real people, it means pain, worry and anguish. We can pay a nurse or a doctor but without the money for medicines, maintaining beds and wards, and heating and cleaning hospitals, we cannot treat patients. We can pay teachers but if schools do not have the money for basic educational supplies, children will suffer. The problem with the Minister's sound economics is that the last element of spending, the part that is only growing by 1%, is the part that allows public servants to deliver a service. For real people in the real world in 2003, that will only amount to crumbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">This is not a plan for the finances of a great nation. This is the juggling of small change between jars that we might expect of someone operating a run-down boarding house. Nobody needs to criticise it, although one major organisation after another, representing everybody from children to farmers and asylum seekers to people with disabilities, have criticised it heavily.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Just to read this budget is to be saddened and short changed and it forces me to misuse a great poet's lines because Eliot's comment comes irresistibly to mind – this is the way this budget ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Let me be specific about the whimper. We know that Ireland is suffering a living nightmare of alcohol abuse and storing up a generation of misery through our failure to tackle the rate of drinking among young people. The Minister had the opportunity to take a series of broad measures that would have serious and beneficial end results. Instead, he went for the whimper. He put 35 cent on alcopops and did not touch beer or a range of other products. I would not wish the slimy cynicism of that action on my worst enemy, least of all a decent man like the Minister. He will acquire the historic reputation as the man who put 35 cent on alcopops. The best measure of the importance of that action was to be found on a newspaper website last night which read: "Minister puts 35 cent on alcopops. Move welcomed by brewers."  That is the height and depth of the budget. A brewery has given the Minister the thumbs up because he imposed an extra few cent on a bottle of alcopops. Shame on the Government and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The budget will shortly be seen for what it is, death by a thousand cuts. Misery, confusion, anger and anguish will be inflicted on the electorate next April and May when the truth of the stealth taxes emerges.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_277">This may be called an alcopops budget. The Minister's intention was to ensure that its initial impact would be relatively congenial. However, after the budgetary provisions make their way through the economy there is a grave danger we will all wake up with a serious hangover.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The Minister has taken grave risks with inflation. He projects an inflation rate of 4.8% next year, yet it is likely to be higher following the impact of the hidden charges and the stealth and indirect taxes. That assumes the downturn, about which we hear so much, is not further aggravated.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">It is galling to listen to the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment seeking to give the impression that we are in this mess because of what they call the international downturn. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are in a mess of the Government's own making arising from the mismanagement of the public finances. The fundamentals of the economy are still sound. The necessity for this bitter budget does not arise from the economic downturn but from the Government's mismanagement that preceded it as it attempted to blatantly buy a general election victory at all costs. It now gambles with the future of our people with the result that, because of unpredictable world events, we do not know what is likely to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">It used to be the boast of the Government that while it may have squandered the boom and may have little to show for the money it flittered away, it could point to the expansion in employment. Most of the jobs were created by the boom in the private sector. Furthermore, in 1997, when Deputy Quinn left Government as Minister for Finance, approximately 1,000 jobs a week were being created, or 55,000 jobs a year. The economy is now losing jobs at the rate of 500 a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Despite this fragile and serious situation the Minister is obsessively opposed to borrowing for any purpose other than making the necessary payment to his pet projects such as the SSIA accounts and investments in the stock markets in Tokyo, New York and elsewhere. The Labour Party predicted that the Minister would ask ordinary people to pay for the Government's profligacy, especially in the two years leading up to the general election. The full pain is now becoming apparent as ordinary income earners and social welfare recipients are punished for the Government's recklessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Not only has there been a series of mini-budgets since this Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government was returned to office, as my colleague, Deputy Burton, pointed out yesterday, but there has also been the brutal Book of Estimates. Apart from accelerating the reversals in public expenditure, the only purpose of the budget is, in presentation terms, to conceal the full extent of the savage adverse impact on living standards. The Minister has sought to do this by stealth and indirect taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">As in his previous budgets when he opted for highly visible reductions in tax rates rather than the less immediately apparent but more progressive tax reform, the Minister has apparently avoided increasing headline tax rates but has achieved the same effect by refusing to index tax bands, taxing more people at the higher rate, piling on extra charges and increasing the scope of stamp duty and indirect taxes. The effect is more severe than appears at first glance as people pay more for a range of services and basic living essentials.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Meanwhile, all the huff and puff about broadening the tax base and tackling the shelters and loopholes that facilitate wealthy people in minimising their tax liability has been shown to be no more than that. The Taoiseach said he would address some of them. In response to direct questions from me on a number of occasions, he said the tax exempt bloodstock industry would be brought into the tax net.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_286">However, the Minister put his foot down and there is now no prospect of that happening. All there is to show for the Government's action is a projected take of €10 million from closing off loopholes and shelters. The Taoiseach loves to hold himself out as the egalitarian, the social democrat in this right-wing Cabinet. He was going to broaden the tax base and close these loopholes, yet the projected yield will be only €10 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In typical Bertie speak the Taoiseach planted two paragraphs in the middle of his Department of Finance script. If somebody can tell me what they mean they are more perceptive than I am. He stated: "With lower personal tax rates and income growth in recent years, it should not be necessary to offer as many tax based incentive schemes as a means of persuading our wealthier and more successful citizens to contribute their fair share to society in the most direct and efficient manner."  I could not have written better, but it is at variance with what the Taoiseach did.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Taoiseach went on to state: "Property investment is an even more attractive option at present and can have the effect of crowding out first-time buyers and others requiring more spacious accommodation for a growing family."</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Everybody on these benches made that argument to him last night. In the motions on stamp duty the Taoiseach said the opposite was the case. Unfortunately we had to take the two conflicting motions on stamp duty together because they were put together for procedural purposes. The argument was made that the stamp duty increase on commercial property is likely to cause a switch from commercial to residential property at a time when there is spare commercial property around the city and country. Leaving that aside I am concerned that it further tightens the options available to young people to purchase houses. As it is, they only get one out of five of the new houses and now the market will be tightened further and provide them with additional competition from investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I did not have the opportunity last night to make my main point because of the exigencies of time considerations and the exceptional boisterousness of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Defence, both of whom were tasting the last alcopops before the excise duty was applied. The Taoiseach is recovering €52 million in stamp duty on cheque books, ATM and Laser cards. The entire personal tax package is €186 million and €52 million is being clawed back. That is the reality of the broadening of the tax base. The Taoiseach says that given the Government was as generous as it has been to business and wealthy sectors of society over the last five years, there should be no need for these tax-based incentive schemes and loopholes, as if he had done something about it. He has done nothing about it. He is quite correct about property investment. People are returning to bricks and mortar because it is the safe option in terms of minding their money. He said in his contribution today that, "As Minister for Finance, I greatly broadened the tax base between 1992 and 1994, but it is a job that has to be done every few years, as new schemes rise up [these are his words] to take the place of those that have been cut down."  It sounds like he is talking about—</p>

New schemes are created by the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleague, Deputy McCreevy. They do not grow up in the abstract. He also said, "In any case, many development incentives only work if the Government is serious about their being time-limited."</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The Taoiseach says that all during his years as Minister for Finance he greatly broadened the tax base but I say he broadened the number of days that tax exiles can stay in this economy.

          <p eId="para_295">Absolutely. The Taoiseach paid such attention to detail in the Finance Act and in the finance legislation that he could make changes even for a single taxpayer. Having facilitated the tax exiles he facilitates the continuation of their tax-exempt industry here.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Deputy Burton and I met the representatives of the stallion industry. It was a very interesting meeting. We asked them if they had met the Minister for Finance and they said there was no need to meet him, it was us they were afraid of because we were the only ones raising this issue. They said that all they needed was a year to put forward the kind of tax structure that is sensitive to the needs of their industry. They were worried about the dominant position which has occurred in that industry and I share that concern. They were worried about the notion of the sole trader being unfairly damaged by a simple extension of, for instance, the corporate profits tax regime to that industry. They said they needed time. They actually offered to make a contribution because they acknowledged it was inequitable that they were excluded. This will not happen while Deputy McCreevy is the Minister for Finance. That would go against everything that he stands for and it would certainly go against the people with whom he goes racing.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Mary Harney has the cheek to go on "Morning Ireland" and talk about this being a fair budget and that it was about concern for the weak and the vulnerable in our society. Yet that is the track record. The Taoiseach stood up in this House and in so far as one can plainly decipher what he says, he said that he accepted the inequity of the present situation. The only impression that one could reasonably take from what he said was that it was going to be addressed in the budget. Worse than that, his spin-doctors put it about in the media over two weekends that the bloodstock industry was going to be asked to make a contribution. I am quite sure that the Department of Finance must have agreed with that. What was desirable for a fledgling industry 30 years ago is no longer the situation, yet absolutely nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The Minister may have avoided the high profile hits of previous budgets such as his notorious raid last year on the social insurance fund. The pain is more acute and more widespread this time. The unexpected shock of a 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT hits the essentials of living such as ESB, fuel needs and so hits everyone, irrespective of income and whether one is employed or unemployed. Inflation in the services sector is already running at about 10% before the impact of the VAT increase. The first-time buyers were thrown to the wolves and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers sold a pup.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The pretence yesterday was that we have resolved the deprivation of €3,850 to first-time buyers by bringing in an improvement in mortgage interest relief that allows them €350 for a couple and €165 for a single person. How is it somehow restorative to give €350 to a young couple in mortgage interest relief when up to now they did their sums on the basis of being able to assemble a deposit that included a cheque, up front for €3,850? What kind of a deal is that? One would not expect Fianna Fáil backbenchers, as Deputy Joe Higgins has a habit of saying, of falling for that at the Dingle horse fair, but apparently they did. They are not falling for it today and they will not be falling for it over the weekend when people start calling to their clinics. That is before the VAT increase of 1% is taken into account. The VAT increase of 1% on the building materials of an average house is roughly €1,000. Where does that leave first-time buyers? This Government is only interested in first-time builders, not first-time buyers. The first-time buyers have been cheated and the gullible Fianna Fáil backbenchers have been hoodwinked and that is the reality. It is a shameful deception in terms of what was promised and of what was put abroad that the revolt in the backbenches resulted in a concession that would be visible on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Each year for the past five years the Government has been happy to tell us how many people it is taking out of the tax net and how many people would no longer pay tax at the higher rate. They were taking the same people out of the net every year because if tax credits and bands are not indexed people pay more tax. There was no such trumpeting from the Government this year. The number of people paying tax at the top rate has shot back up. In last year's budget we were told that 90% of the minimum wage would be exempt from tax; this year again 90% is exempt from tax. There is nothing in the budget for the lower paid. There is nothing much in it either for one income families. The policy of individualisation lingers on, always close to the Minister's heart. By increasing the PAYE allowance and not the personal credit, he is adding that little extra insult to injury inflicted on one income families by individualisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The social welfare package in this budget is a disgrace. After inflation, people on the lowest rate of social welfare will be left with 30 cent out of €6. The target for social welfare increases in the national anti-poverty strategy has been ignored and the strategy itself is already a dead duck. After taking inflation into account at 4.8%, social welfare recipients on the headline rate will be left with 30 cent. Do not forget, the rental supplement has been cut by €4.32. Many of these things were not factored into the hostile media comment the Government got today. Most journalists, with all due respect to them, would not know too much about the rental supplement. They, like those of us in this House, do not have resort to it. A €4.32 cut in the rental supplement is a mean cut for people on the lowest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Child benefit has been increased by €8 per month, one quarter of what this Government committed to. There is nothing else in the budget about child care – this is the only reference. All the eggs are in the basket of child benefit. The entitlement to child benefit amounts to €2 per week which Barnardos said last night would not buy a loaf of bread and a pint of milk. Some 5,000 people will be cut from the public service, the same number which has been cut from the CE schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The most infuriating aspect of this dramatic reversal of engines is that the Minister for Finance has the gall to continue using language about "fair budget" and "protecting weaker sections of society", a mantra repeated on radio this morning by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. What is fair about a social welfare provision which barely keeps pace with inflation before ESB, bus fare and fuel increases? What is fair about breaking the Government's contract with the recipients of child benefit but keeping its contract to take 3.5 percentage points off the corporation profit tax regime? The Minister made choices and he chose to keep the contract with business but to abrogate it with parents eligible for child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The last page of the Taoiseach's speech was devoted to lefty bashing which is unusual for him because he usually presents himself as one of us. It implies that somehow we are hostile to some of the tax structure for business. Nothing could be further from the truth. Deputy Quinn was the main author of the corporation profit tax rate which I enthusiastically supported after much examination. I was persuaded, having argued through the system for a 15% regime, that one could not increase the profit tax regime from 10% to 15% because that would be a 50% increase for those who located here in terms of foreign direct investment under the 10% enclave arrangement. I do not know how that implies hostility on our part to the corporation profit tax rate which, undoubtedly, gives us competitive advantage and is a valuable instrument of industrial policy attracting jobs and investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">All we recommended was that given the mess the Government created, the last step of it might be postponed for one year – the further reduction of 3.5 points. What harm would that have done? It cost €305 million at a time when times are tight. It would not have affected those on the 10% rate because they are on that anyway. All it would have done would have been to maintain the rest of the corporate sector paying at 16%.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Down from 40%. Where is the great sense of grievance there? That could have been borne for one year and given some latitude. The Minister for Finance had to impose a levy on the banks and financial institutions. If anybody in this House or outside thinks the financial institutions will pay the €100 million, they should have second thoughts. It will be passed on to the consumer just as the stamp duty is directly levied on the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Language has no meaning for the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As families are hit at every turn and they prattle on about being fair, the Taoiseach joins them in the other mantra about all this pain being due to world conditions. It is due to no such thing. It is due to the mismanagement of the public finances deliberately engaged in by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance in order to win the election. They go on about maintaining sound public finances as if the Opposition or someone else was responsible for the reckless mismanagement we have lived through and which, to some extent, was camouflaged by the inordinate growth rates of recent years. There were several patches in the Taoiseach's speech this morning and in the Minister for Finance's last night which talked about the need to get back to sound finances as if we were responsible for the mismanagement. One would think this was a new Government coming in taking over from some Government which had made a bags of it and that it had to get back on the straight and narrow. This Government has to get back on the straight and narrow because it created its own mess.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_310">They talk about consolidating gains but what they really mean is cutting the tripe out of public services. The truth is straightforward. For blatant, partisan and political advantage, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats – the Progressive Democrats no less than Fianna Fáil – embarked on a spending spree to win the election. Now they have embarked on a reversal of engines not because of any fundamental weakness in the underlying economy but because of their earlier recklessness. They talk about it as if it is a new Government which had identified mismanagement by parties opposite. They made the mess and now ordinary people are being asked to pay for it. Having spent their way through the last election, they want to build up a war chest for the next one so they can do it over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were scarcely back in Government Buildings when we had the first mini-budget which led to an array of charges set out by my colleague, Deputy Burton, yesterday. Education registration fees are up 69%, VHI has increased by 17%, ESB charges will go up by 13.5%, the disregard in respect of drugs charges is up from €53 to €70, €5 of which was added the night before last, charges for casualty visits are up 25% and effective bus and rail fares are up by 14%.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The mini-budget was then followed by a savage Book of Estimates which unashamedly tore up these parties' election manifestos and programme for Government. They insulted the intelligence of the public with pedantic games about adjustments and reductionism in the rate of increase. Major commitments were casually shredded, including 2,000 gardaí who were not provided for in the Book of Estimates. We now have an embargo. There will be no more gardaí and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform laughs his way through the Order of Business. The only real acid test of a Minister is whether he or she can get money at the Cabinet table. If 2,000 additional gardaí were considered necessary last May, they are more necessary now but there will not be one extra garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Some 200,000 low income earners had the prospect of medical cards held out to them but that prospect is gone and there is no hope of delivering on it. Parents were bombarded with cynical letters from Fianna Fáil and PD candidates in the election saying that their rundown dilapidated school would be refurbished, that work was approved and in the pipeline and had they not talked to the Minister directly. That promise is gone at the stroke of a pen. Nothing will happen in respect of 398 of the 400 primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The health strategy is in tatters. It was announced yesterday that €2.8 million will be provided for health. That is what "Steve Silvermint" got for his Department. Some €7.7 billion is to be provided for the health strategy, but the "Dauphin" came in with €2.8 million yesterday. Some €1,100 million has been promised in additional health capital funding for 2003, but only €3.8 million will be delivered. The Taoiseach wanted to get in on the act of eliminating hospital queues. He told us that hospital queues would be eliminated in two years.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_316">These were major promises affecting many ordinary citizens as the Government parties continued to waltz through the boom scattering taxpayers' money at every problem with no plan to get value for money or reform the services. There is a great line in the Taoiseach's script. The loyalty of civil servants is marvellous and their facility with the English language knows no bounds. The Taoiseach said in his speech that nearly every sector had benefited from huge increases over the past five years and the tighter situation that exists now with spending levelling off on a high plateau would be an incentive to ensure concentration on the essentials and the more important priorities rather than to behave as if money were no object. What is he implying? Is it that Deputy Kenny or one of his predecessor's behaved as if money were no object? He is the one who behaved as if money were no object. It was the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister, Deputy Harney, whose Department is awash with money, who behaved as if money were no object.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The bad news is that these three phases, the mini-budget by stealth, the Book of Estimates and the budget, is not all there is. There is more to come as forecast in the report by the three wise but orthodox men. The motto of the Government has moved from "a lot done, more to do" to "a lot done and more to come". The real story of this budget is in "An Bord Snip Mark 2", that this may be only an interim budget and another may be on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The report, published on the website yesterday while we were in the Chamber, states that if in the light of a deteriorating budget situation further substantial savings are needed, the following options may have to be considered: reduce numbers in the Defence Forces – that will get the Minister for Defence off his alcopops; review pupil-teacher ratios; reduce compensatory allowances for farmers; further increase third level fees; review universality of child benefit; transport – phasing of capital programmes over a longer period; introduction of water charges in 2003; reduction in allocation for child care initiatives; reduction in allocation for housing; and further increase the drugs refund threshold. We have already seen the implementation of that recommendation on Monday, although maybe there is more to come. When will we see the implementation of the rest of the "An Bord Snip" menu? Is there a second budget to come? Is there another budget in the offing? Yesterday the Minister promised that he will initiate such a review as is recommended starting in January 2003. That is next month. The signal is clear. If there is an international downturn, the Minister for Finance will be back for more. There is one simple response to the budget, its partner, the Book of Estimates, and the second budget that may be in the offing, it is to ask the question, where has all the money gone?</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Our Constitution includes a provision that the State shall provide for free primary education. Our Government has decided regardless of that, it intends to slash the primary school building programme by 4% next year and in this respect we have now learned that 400 school building projects are effectively frozen.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">In addition to the big slash and burn and stealth features, the Government is engaged in pettiness. The allocation for the library grant for primary schools for next year is a mere €1.5 million, the same as for this year. There is also a budget full of stealth cuts and increases in living costs and public service charges. In the small print in the accompanying documentation there is a reference to third level tuition fees. It is stated that the most significant proposal put forward by the committee – the three wise orthodox men – is to introduce a student contribution to third level tuition fees in addition to the student registration charge. It is also stated that this would bring the composite fee from €670 to €1,000 in 2003. It is further stated that having regard to the overall cost of providing places at third level, the committee feels this is a reasonable proposal. Does the Government consider this is a reasonable proposal? That is the question the Minister must answer. From the point of view of justice and equity, is an annual combined fee of €1,000 a year reasonable? Where is the recently stated qualifier of the Minister for Education and Science in respect of those who can afford it? It is not there. There is no sign of it in the same way as there was no sign of the 70% increase in the registration fee in the Government parties' election literature and just as there is not any sign of the 200,000 medical cards. As for the delivery of public services generally, "An Bord Snip" says there is a need to review the number of Defence Forces barracks, Garda stations, schools and health service facilities. What does this mean if not barracks, schools, Garda station and health centre closures accompanying the job cuts that have been announced?</p>
          <p eId="para_321">With regard to water charges, it is stated that drinking water quality and sewage treatment requirements are becoming more stringent and water sanitary services are becoming more expensive to provide and operate. It is also stated that the absence of a charging regime on domestic consumers will continue to put pressure on the Exchequer. It is further stated that a charging regime could contribute to more efficient use of what is becoming an increasingly expensive resource. It is stated that Ireland is unique among OECD and EU member states in not charging domestic consumers. It looks like billing is on the way and no doubt metering will follow close behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, put forward a proposal to reintroduce tuition fees – it appears he is serious about it – on the basis of equity. The Education Welfare Board was set up in 2001 by the then Minister, Deputy Woods. The idea was to provide a system of education welfare officers who would invigilate school attendance in disadvantaged areas where high absenteeism is the norm. I recall that a survey of 2,000 pupils in Killinarden in my constituency showed that on average on any given day 20% of pupils were absent. There is no school attendance inspection arrangement in the county of Dublin or in several other areas. The Education Welfare Board was established to put in place this system of education welfare officers. I do not know about what my colleague, Deputy Stagg, said this morning concerning the resignation of the chairperson of the board, but I would not be surprised. Neither the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, nor the Minister for Finance has told the House that the provision of €13.6 million to enable education welfare officers do their work has been cut to €3.2 million, and this is from the man who has a commitment to equity in education. This money was set aside to put in place a system to provide for children in disadvantaged areas who because of dysfunctional or other factors in the home do not attend primary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Six months ago the Taoiseach was walking on water, today he is up to his knees in it. Some 18 months ago this Government cynically set out to buy the election. Ministers promised the sun, moon and the stars. They outrageously wasted and misspent our money in a splurge for power. Now the kitty is near empty and we are being told that we have to pay for their scandalous waste. That is what lies behind the cuts. That is what is behind the meanness of vision underpinning this budget and the Estimates. The Government is imposing the cost of its abuse of power on ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Minister for Finance professes a deep commitment to sound money and an abiding opposition to borrowing. Where was this alleged commitment for the past two or three years? Where was it when the Government set about buying the election? Where was the opposition to a return to borrowing as the Minister watched the enormous budgetary surpluses that accrued from the economic boom evaporate before his eyes? Where was this opposition and the commitment to sound money when fellow Ministers squandered the people's money in their blind ambition to buy a general election? Where was it when, in the midst of this abuse of power, the prospect of a return to borrowing loomed larger every day? The present Minister for Finance is the most irresponsible holder of the office in the history of the State. Where was the Minister's sense of responsibility and duty to his office when he wrote the famous letter to the then leader of the Fine Gael Party promising that no cutbacks whatsoever were being planned, secretly or otherwise?</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Minister's self professed obsession with resisting borrowing is a sham. It also does not make common sense, whether it is in terms of an economy or a household. Everybody borrows – nations, people and households borrow. They borrow for the future and against future income. Borrowing is an essential part of life and living. The real test is whether the borrowing is sensible and prudent. That ought to be the test. What does this budget do? It shows a deficit for this year of €193 million, a deficit for next year of €1.8 billion, a deficit for 2004 of €3.4 billion and a deficit in 2005 of €3.7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The borrowing that is now a reality is not the result of prudent decision making but of a disgraceful, sustained and massive exercise in vote buying, the most serious abuse of power by a Government in the history of the State. At the end of it all, social welfare recipients get 30 cent, which would not buy a box of matches. This is a matchbox budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">Dúirt an Taoiseach go raibh an buiséad seo de dhíth ar an tír agus go mbeidh pian éigin i gceist. Nuair a dúirt sé sin, bhí sé ag cur leis na bréaganna atá ráite ag an Rialtas faoin bhuiséad agus faoi na polasaithe atá aige. Dúirt an Taoiseach gur buiséad cothrom agus forásach seo a thugann aire do no daoine is boichte sa tsochaí. Seo bréag agus cruthaíodh sin inniu agus inné nuair a léadh an buiséad. An dream is laige atá thíos sa bhuiséad seo, mar atá siad thíos le gach buiséad ón Rialtas seo le cúig bliana anuas.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, began his speech yesterday by stating that he had three clear objectives in the budget. The first one, protecting the weaker sections of society, was laudable. It was good to see that for once the poor came first in the Minister's budget but that is where it ended. What we saw afterwards was nothing less than a continuation of the sustained and vigorous assault that this Government has mounted over the past five years on the less well off in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Since 1997, McCreevy economics have seen the richest 10% of the population receive over a quarter of the benefits of budgets. At the same time, the poorest 20% of society have received a mere 5%. The Minister is clearly a firm believer in the redistribution of wealth. However, he is obviously no socialist and neither is the Taoiseach. In his speech this morning, the Taoiseach attacked left-wing and socialist Members. The Taoiseach and the Minister want to add to the wealth of the wealthiest in society. The gap between the rich and the poor in Irish society has been systematically and deliberately widened to a point where it is now one of the most unequal societies in the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The price increases have hit hardest the households which are dependent on social welfare payments. In recent times they have seen numerous other increases, such as the increase in fares on public transport, increases in the cost of private rented accommodation, the 22% increase in the monthly drug payments scheme, the 26% increase in the cost of casualty department fees and, incredibly, the 21% increase in the cost of electricity since 2001. To add to that, the Minister has announced a VAT increase which will affect everyone in society, especially those who have little disposable income. With the highest inflation in the eurozone, the cost of living has risen throughout the past six years of champagne Charlie's economics.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Families struggling to get by have been pushed harder and harder. Those who manage to set aside a euro or two find their meagre savings disappearing fast as costs increase across the board. The undeclared ideological war that this Government has been waging against the poor and less well off in society continued in yesterday's budget. Children in this State are twice as likely as adults to experience poverty and a quarter of them are living in relative poverty. Children are going to dilapidated schools—</p>

          <p eId="para_333">Yes. Anybody who is living in poverty will show, if the Minister is willing to spend a couple of weeks with them, how hard it is to get by on the meagre bits the Government throws at them with one hand and takes away from them with the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The Government has betrayed those children to such an extent that many still go to school hungry. It has betrayed them by targeting the most vulnerable members of society. Nowhere is this more obvious than in child benefit. If the Government had done the unthinkable and lived up to one of the pledges it gave during the election campaign this year, there would have been increases of between €30 and €40 in the two levels of child benefit. Instead the increase was €8. The Government committed itself in the past to a three stage implementation of increases in child benefit costing €1.2 billion. It has reneged on that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Compare that with its commitment to reduce corporation tax to 12.5%. It fulfilled that commitment. The choice was simple, support the corporations and big business or support the poor. Charlie McCreevy made his choice and I hope he finds it easy—</p>

Bíodh an tAire agus Rialtas ar rabhadh and I hope he and his colleagues in Government find it easy to sleep at night while they prolong the suffering of tens of thousands of children so that their friends in business can continue to fumble in the greasy till.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Child benefit is the most scandalous element in the Minister's budget. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness called for a minimum welfare payment of €127 by 2003. Even the Fianna Fáil progress report in 2001 said that would not be enough and that it should be increased. The increase the Minister granted yesterday and his paltry increase to pensioners will be wiped out by inflation. His gesture and his utter contempt are like giving the two fingers to the less well-off in society, the unemployed and the disabled. Does the Minister truly expect us to believe that the target of €150 a week as the basic welfare payment by 2007 will ever be achieved? We should bear in mind that €150 is inadequate and far from enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">These people have been denied full participation in society and the gap between rich and poor has widened daily. This should be the greatest single issue facing the Government. It is a pity its members do not have the eyes to see it. The inequality the Minister for Finance has fostered over five years is set to continue and will be the lasting monument of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The child dependant allowance has effectively been frozen since 1997. These payments are vital and target the most needy children for assistance. The allowance rates available are inadequate and, despite a recommendation from the commission on social welfare eight years ago, there are still three distinct rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The back to school allowance for primary school children remains untouched. Is the Minister so out of touch that he believes €80 will go far in paying for a uniform, footwear, books and equipment for children returning to primary school? Is he clapping himself on the back because he gave an additional €30 for secondary school students? Does he believe he has accomplished something by doing this? This is nowhere near enough for those families struggling every September to try to ensure their children have at least the basic uniform, footwear and schoolbooks to take part in the education programme, despite all the disadvantages thrown at them.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">For the fifth year in a row there will be no increase in the payments made under the infamous direct provision system for asylum seekers. Inflation has decreased the value of this allowance which makes it a hidden cut. This makes a nonsense of the Minister's claim that the budget would protect the weakest in society. It is hard to know who in society could be more vulnerable than refugee women and their children yet they will continue to suffer in 2003. I challenge the Minister or any members of the Government to attempt to live in dignity on €19.10 a week and to care properly for their children with only an extra €9.55 per child.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">If we were to double the current direct provision pittance it would cost us a little more than €4.5 million. The grant to the horse and greyhound racing fund costs the Exchequer €64 million. Surely the Minister does not intend to send out the message that Ireland cares more for horses and hounds than for those fleeing persecution. We know the Government is cynical. Perhaps it is because asylum seekers cannot vote that the figure for direct provision has not been raised in five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">No increase in funding is being made available to tackle the education infrastructural deficit. There is also the fact that the Minister announced 5,000 job cuts in the public service and a further 5,000 in community employment schemes. This will probably be added to next year when "An Bord Snip" gets its way and announces another 4,000 job cuts. If the Minister or anyone else saw 10,000 jobs going overnight there would be an outcry, but the Minister is getting away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Minister had a choice yesterday. He could have made the well-off in society pay their share but he chose not to honour his commitment to children or the less well-off. Buiséad an slíbhín é seo. Bhí deis ag an Aire inné agus níor thapaidh sé é. Tá sé ag iarraidh an dallamullóg a chur ar an bpobail, ach ní éireoidh leis mar níl an pobail chomh dall sin.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_346">Bhí a fhios ag an Comhaontas Glas roimh an olltoghchán nach raibh aon flathúlacht ann don Rialtas. We predicted a 3% growth rate whereas other parties playfully predicted 5%. We knew it would not be a generous budget. We also knew, following his legacy as Minister for Social Welfare, that the Minister for Finance knows how to do one thing, namely, not to flinch when it comes to marginalising the marginalised. Gandhi was famous for wise quotations such as the greatness of a nation is to be judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable. If greatness is what Gandhi had in mind in this regard, the Government is not great by a long shot.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Deputy Rabbitte said earlier that the three wise men, "An Bord Snip" as they are known colloquially, will be the bearers of the real cuts after this budget. We have read about the prospects in the future of no grants to youth organisations, fewer services to schools, less funding for health services, increased bed charges, cuts in community jobs from 24,000 to 15,000 and cuts in environmental funds. Many other areas are mentioned in reports today and we look forward to the Government refuting these and saying they are nothing more than idle speculation.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Minister is set on a course of keeping borrowing low at 0.7% of gross domestic product, but this is a fig leaf for the real borrowing in the form of public private partnerships. These will involve many areas such as schools, hospitals, road building projects, Luas and what are known as environmental services. PPPs are entertained by companies because they are lucrative, not because they are charitable. A PPP for a sewage treatment plant is not as lucrative as one for an incinerator. People are not charged every time they flush the toilet but they are every time they put out their bins. One is able to make a huge profit from building an incinerator. When I see environmental services, I read "incinerators" and "super dumps" because they are the most profitable areas in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The knock-on effects for people in this case are not just the costs and charges which are in the long grass and will be excused by the Government as not being public but private charges, someone else's business, not the Government's, and I hope people make the connection that the budget is laying the foundation for that type of Pontius Pilate act, but the foundation is also being laid for other knock-on effects involving considerable problems in terms of the impact on farming and health when and if incinerators are built, which I hope they will not be.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Farmers are already reeling from the effects of the ongoing difficulties in farming which have many causes. The national development plan with its road building programme gets another shot in the arm from the Minister and even in the form of capital gains, which rightly should be increased for those who are wealthy. However, taking it from farmers who are presented with a CPO and cannot afford to buy land to replace the land they have lost in my constituency and others around the country, then we are kicking those who are already in a vulnerable position. The Government does not seem to have a problem doing that, but the Green Party certainly has a problem with that level of inequity and unfairness. It is kicking those who form and will continue to form the backbone in providing food in this country. The Government needs to reflect seriously on its mistakes in that regard and should introduce a scheme to allow for land to be swapped. If there is a CPO on land, we should not simply give it a valuation and take money in tax, we should determine the acreage that was compulsorily purchased and let people continue with their livelihoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The National Roads Authority programme is in direct conflict with the spatial strategy we heard about last week. We have two governments. We have the spatial strategy government that told us last week it was important not to have a magnet in Dublin with everything drawn to it. This week we have the budget, which recommends full speed ahead with the roads programme at the expense of many other things, including health, and we are told this is the implementation of the spatial strategy. This budget is in direct conflict with the spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The fundamental problems will not be addressed by the spatial strategy. In the housing area the mortgage interest relief represents little more than a press release in terms of its value to many people who will not get anything worth talking about in their pockets once VAT and the other clawbacks from the budget kick in. It takes the heat off the question for the Government and the heat needs to be put back on the Government in relation to house prices. The 1973 Kenny report needs to be brought out, dusted down and its recommendations need to be examined. If a constitutional amendment is required to have it implemented, then let us do that. We are facing a crisis in terms of homelessness, difficulty in finding housing, rack-rents and the widening gap between rich and poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Students in particular are caught up in that. We hear the Government wants to eliminate the student accommodation tax break. I did not believe that tax break was a great idea, but if we are to abolish it, let us replace it with some form of campus or student accommodation capital investment. We are at the bottom of the EU league when it comes to student accommodation. Students are already suffering in terms of maintenance grants and difficulties in getting by in their educational as well as their day-to-day needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">There is a lack of long-term thinking in this budget. That is unfortunate, because if the Minister was not going to be able to give away a significant amount of money, at least he should start to strategically plan for the long-term. For many people education represents their hope for the long-term, but yet there are still 5,000 early school leavers, another 1,000 leaving after primary school and 8% consistent child poverty according to Focus Ireland. So the long-term under this Government does not look good. It has not introduced quality of life indicators in terms of energy use, waste, water and food miles, which is a concept the Government needs to embrace in terms of energy and sustainability. It has not narrowed the gap between rich and poor, which is still widening and biodiversity is suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Government needs to have a think tank to determine a long-term vision. It needs sustainability and to embrace the whole climate change issue, which it has again sidelined in this budget. Scientists are now being forced to reject the view of climate change as a problem that gradually builds up until we clean up our act. It is still the Government's view that we can get around to it sooner or later. Things will not simply return to normal when that happens. In the new model, once we exceed a critical threshold in terms of CO2 emissions, the planet's ecosystems begin to amplify rather than buffer climate change, leading to havoc on a global scale. We can be fairly certain it will not be the end of life on earth. It might not even be the end of humanity, but our western free market economy with its emphasis on globalised distribution systems, into which we have put all our eggs, will be the first casualty.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">In light of recent evidence and the flooding, our current emissions target of 13% increase on 1990 levels by 2010, which is generous internationally, is looking sadly past its sell by date. I wonder whether the Taoiseach took stock of anything that was said when he attended the Johannesburg earth summit. It needed to recognise that a 60% to 80% reduction in emissions is now urgently required. This might allow developing nations to get through the carbon intensive stage of building the schools, railways and hospitals they urgently need to stabilise their populations without global net emissions passing their critical runaway point. Scientists have put this analysis to us and we ignore it at our peril. I hope the Government will have time, but that time is running out and putting off a carbon tax into the never-never is staring into the abyss. This Government is irresponsible and criminally negligent in doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Government seems to be frozen in a business as usual mode. Having crashed the economy, it now appears to be in a daze. The flooding has not helped because when one is wet and cold it is very difficult to think where one's best future interests lie. We need to put in place a transition to a low-energy, high-efficiency society, which will create a safety net in the event of global marketplace collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">When the Taoiseach spoke earlier the only international crisis he mentioned was Iraq. Undoubtedly Iraq will have a major economic as well as humanitarian impact on this country if war goes ahead there. However, the real war, which has not been confronted or even recognised, is the war in terms of climate change. Nature is fighting us in terms of the floods and the havoc that is being wreaked. It is easy to overstate this matter because the scenarios are so devastating when one considers hurricane Mitch and other such catastrophic so-called natural disasters. This country is wide open to this by embracing globalised distribution systems, in which the Deputy Harney takes great pride. If that is her agenda, it is being well done, but it leaves us exposed to a significant extent and we do not have the self-reliance that will provide the safety net if, for example, fossil fuel is no longer available and if our markets are hit either through war in Iraq or the climate change devastation, which is war by another name. I ask the Government to take stock of our inability and unpreparedness for those eventualities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_359">Yesterday when I listened to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, deliver his budget I thought of the phrase, "A week is a long time in politics". Five and a half months is a lifetime. As the great Sligo poet, W.B. Yeats, said: "All is changed, changed utterly". I can still hear the echoes to the pre-election statements which promised: no significant overruns; no cutbacks, planned secretly or otherwise; an extra 200,000 to be given medical cards; hospital waiting lists to be eliminated within two years; an extra 2,000 gardaí on the streets; a significant increase in child benefit; and the list goes on. However we must remember what P. J. Mara told us: "That was showtime".</p>
          <p eId="para_360">What is the reality of yesterday's budget? As ordinary citizens go about their daily lives this morning, what has the Minister delivered? First-time buyers were dealt a bitter blow. There were considerable expectations among this group that the Minister would reconsider his position and ease the financial pressure. What did he do? With one hand he gave a miserly increase in mortgage interest relief while with the other he took more away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">An increase in VAT of 1% will push up the cost of the average house by approximately €2,000. Coupled with the loss of the first-time buyer's grant this means that new house buyers will have woken up this morning with an even bigger headache than yesterday as they realise their financial position worsened overnight. Investors, on the other hand, with money to invest in residential property will have woken up with a smile on their faces. All is well with this group which remains the big winners as first-time buyers are further squeezed out of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I was struck during the Budget Statement by some of its inherent contradictions. The Minister informed us that one of the key objectives was to protect the weaker sections of society. What is the reality for these people this morning? Those on the minimum wage are still being taxed. In my constituency and all over the country primary school children and their teachers will continue to sit in substandard classrooms. Many schools, including Riverstown school in County Sligo and Mohill school in Country Leitrim which were highlighted by RTE on Tuesday evening and Brockley national school in Coolaney, will wait. On arriving in my office this morning a voice mail message awaited me which expressed the anger and dismay felt by so many parents over continuing delays in upgrading our primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The carer's allowance is still means tested. Those who look after the weakest and most vulnerable in society are still subjected to a means test or as it is correctly described by many carers, the mean test on carer's allowance. Farmers are being asked to protect the environment yet are denied the means of doing so. Rural renewal schemes designed to maintain and, hopefully, increase the population in deprived rural areas are being discontinued. Thousands of workers on community employment schemes, the lifeblood of many urban and rural communities, today face a bleak future. Youth work services, services for the elderly and disabled and community services will evaporate in the coming months. The weaker sections of society the Minister promised to protect will know the difference and most will suffer in silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Those who require medicines on an ongoing basis will know the difference now that the threshold for the drugs refund scheme has been raised for a second time this year. Those who are on hospital waiting lists will have woken up this morning to the reality that promises made last May have been broken. As of today, there are 629 people on the in-patient waiting list in Sligo General Hospital, an increase of 83 since the end of June. This is the reality of the budget for these people. The Minister has not protected the weaker sections of society, he has betrayed them in the most cruel way because he and the Government raised their expectations and then utterly failed to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Today and yesterday we heard a great deal about the areas of the economy in which the Government is investing. As somebody who is new to politics I sometimes feel certain politicians lose the run of themselves when speaking about the money they have given to health, social welfare or education. Politicians do not give money, they manage our money. This is how we judge them, not by the millions or billions they spend. Taxpayers and workers, in other words ordinary individuals, are the people who generate this money and they judge politicians by results.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">While spending on health has increased substantially, waiting lists, certainly in Sligo, are growing. Investment in education is also increasing. The Taoiseach cited a figure of €5.6 billion. However, many school children and their teachers are still enduring Third World conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">If we are to judge the Minister on delivery, how will we judge him with regard to the treatment of the regions? There another contradiction emerges between the Estimates, the budget and the national spatial strategy. The spatial strategy unveiled last Thursday named Sligo and Letterkenny as new gateways and Ballina and Castlebar as hubs. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, informed us that this is a 20 year strategy. Which elements of the Estimates and the budget will kick-start the spatial strategy and show good faith and intent? Will the Taoiseach explain how he was able to envisage a strong developmental role for the western investment fund during his meeting with the Western Development Commission when the true intention of the Government towards the west is revealed in a massive cutback in the fund of 68% and a 25% cut in the much over-hyped CLÁR programme?</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Will the Minister explain how he was able to commit funds to the mid-block route so vital to freeing up Sligo's traffic and starting the process of developing the town into a gateway city on the eve of the general election only to withdraw the funding in the Estimates two weeks ago? Will he guarantee that the extra allocation to roads yesterday will be targeted at building the mid-block route or the Carrick-on-Shannon bypass in order that we can begin to get adequate access to the new gateway of Sligo?</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Will he also explain another broken promise, namely, the severe cuts in the money allocated to the roll-out of broadband to the regions? Before the election the Government announced a programme of €300 million which was to be its contribution to kick-starting private sector investment in broadband in the regions. Phase one has been cut by almost 30%. The Minister had an opportunity to show good faith and reverse the cut contained in the Estimates. He could have kept to his pre-election promises, but he did not and, instead, let us down again.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I return to the question of how the Minister manages our money. This morning the Taoiseach stated resources must be prioritised and specifically mentioned transport and infrastructure. I ask the Minister to re-prioritise within the infrastructure budget. The national development plan contains a commitment to spend vast sums of money on five motorways which will run from Dublin to Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Belfast respectively. According to Mr. Michael Tobin, Chief Executive of the National Roads Authority, the decision to build these motorways was a political one. Political decisions can be changed in light of changed circumstances. Instead of spending a disproportionate amount of already scarce resources on motorways I ask the Minister to spend it more equitably across all regions, including the west and north-west. High quality roads, dual carriageways, bypasses and passing lanes, where appropriate, are required. Such a strategy would underpin the promise of balanced regional development contained in the national development plan and national spatial strategy. Otherwise balanced regional development will become another empty promise, of which we have had too many in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Another issue connected with money management is the Minister's increasing reliance on public private partnerships which have just delivered a new, state-of-the-art school in Tubbercurry in my constituency. Nevertheless, I advise caution. It is clear public private partnerships provide a short-term fix to the challenge of accelerating large, public capital projects. This has enormous short-term political appeal. The estimated cost of the five group schools is €80 million, yet payments by the Government, hence the taxpayer, will amount to approximately €244 million over 25 years. This is borrowing by another name. Surely the State can borrow at a more preferential rate than the private sector? If we are to build roads using public private partnerships, why can the State not benefit instead of the private sector? We are in a position to borrow yet we are allowing the private sector to reap the rewards which should rightly accrue to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I question the Minister's allocation to the pension fund. At first glance it seems reasonable and prudent to put money away for pensions. However, when we dig a little deeper and examine some of the figures we find the pension fund allocation is almost ten times the sum allocated for the national schools building fund. We would be much better off spending this money on the national schools building fund than putting it away for pensions. We do not have the demographic time bomb that exists in the UK and the rest of Europe. The birth rate here has increased enormously, with 60,000 births for every 30,000 deaths. Inward migration this year is of the order of 25,000. Instead of an ageing population, for now and the foreseeable future, we will have a young, active population that is working and creating wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">In the UK, a third of the population is over 50 years of age while a quarter is under 20 years. That is the reverse to Ireland where a quarter of the population is over 50 while a third is under 20. For every nine people over 50 we have 12 people under 20. Instead of investing this money in a pension fund, we should invest it in capital infrastructure projects, rather than in some of the public private partnerships. If we do this, we will get a double return on our investment. We should use our own money for investment in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In the final analysis, budgets are about managing taxpayers' money wisely. The Minister for Finance has failed this test.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_375">The present coalition Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fail has now delivered six budgets. Through all those budgets we have pursued a very clear strategy. We have reduced corporation tax in order to encourage enterprise; we have reduced capital gains tax to encourage investment, and we have reduced personal income tax to encourage employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We did so, while still providing substantial additional resources for the improvement of public services. We managed to achieve all that, while running a substantial surplus on the Government's current account in every single year. The Government's tax strategy has worked and the figures are there to prove it.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">There are many measures for assessing social and economic progress but I wish to focus on three, in particular, which highlight the Government's record since it took office in mid-1997. The number of people at work has risen by more than 400,000, to 1.8 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen from 10.3% to 4.6%. The number of people in long-term unemployment has dropped from 90,000 to less than 22,000. The rate of long-term unemployment now stands at just 1.2%. Given that long-term joblessness is one of the most important contributors to persistent poverty, reducing the rate to such a low level represents a remarkable achievement in terms of social progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Some of the more cynical commentators question whether the boom years of the Celtic tiger have left any monuments. The achievement of full employment and the effective elimination of long-term unemployment are the real monuments to our recent economic success. However, those achievements are not necessarily permanent. We live in a very competitive and challenging world and unless we pursue the right policies, we can easily slip back into the economic mire from which we have only recently emerged. There can be no room for complacency. Not now, or ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">It took the Government just two years to bring the unemployment rate down from 10% to 5%, to shift Ireland from mass unemployment to near full employment. However, if the right policies can drive us forwards very quickly, the wrong ones can drive us backwards with equal rapidity. That is why it is vital for the economy that we persevere with the pro-enterprise, pro-employment policies that have served us so well over the past five years. Budget 2003 consolidates and copperfastens the progress that has been made in the five previous budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">We have reached our target of getting the standard rate of corporation tax down to 12.5%. We have maintained the incentive to invest and take risks by holding the standard rate of capital gains tax at 20%. The rates of personal income tax have been held at 20% and 42%. The increase in tax credits in this year's budget ensures that 90% of the increased minimum wage is kept out of the tax net, a very significant achievement at a time when resources are limited. It should also be recognised that there have been dramatic increases in the level of tax credits and tax bands over the past five budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">When the present coalition took office, a single person started paying tax at an income of less than €98 per week. Today, a single person can earn €223 per week without paying income tax. When we took office there was no national minimum wage. Since it was first introduced, we increased the rate substantially. In the past, a single person reached the top rate of tax, which was then 48%, at an income of just €17,270 per year. Today, a single person does not reach the top rate, which is just 42%, until his or her income exceeds €28,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Prudent management of the public finances has been central to our economic success of recent years. Tough decisions were required to reduce the rate of growth in public spending in 2003 and bring it down to a more sustainable level. Despite this, the Government has still provided the resources necessary to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients. I am particularly pleased that we have been able, once again, to deliver very significant increases for old age pensioners. Before this coalition took office, pensioners were at the end of the queue when it came to sharing the fruits of economic growth. All that changed in 1997. The Progressive Democrats set a new target rate of £100 per week for the old age pension. We not only reached that target, we exceeded it.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Taking the budget increase into account the value of the weekly old age contributory pension has risen by almost €60 since the Government took office. That is an increase of nearly 60% in six budgets and it provides real evidence of the Government's commitment to pensioners. The Government parties committed themselves at last summer's general election to a €200 a week target for the old age pension by 2007. With yesterday's increase, that target is now within affordable reach during the lifetime of the present Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Tough decisions were also required to ensure that the national finances were kept in sound balance. This has necessitated certain increases in taxation, but we have avoided increases in direct taxation, which might threaten the great progress which was made in generating employment. Increases in indirect taxes were necessary and they have been designed to have the least possible impact on the consumer price index. The Government does not have any apology to make for imposing a significant increase in tobacco taxation. The evidence shows that demand for tobacco products is not elastic and that increasing taxation can play a role in decreasing consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Some people would have us believe we are in the midst of a fiscal and economic crisis. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us look at the public finances. Our debt to GDP ratio, which stands at 34% after this budget, is the second lowest in Europe. Our current budget is in surplus again, as it has been every year since the Government took office. Our performance, in terms of general Government deficit, is one of the best of any EMU country and is fully in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Challenges still remain, such as controlling public spending and finding the resources to fund a massive infrastructural development programme. However, talk of a crisis is simply not supported by the evidence. With regard to the economy, international factors have ensured that our growth rate has moderated significantly compared with the past five years or so. We are a trading nation, reliant on others to buy our exports. This is an open economy with a high reliance on foreign direct investment, particularly from the United States. Like all free market economies, we depend on that precious commodity, confidence, both domestic and international, to sustain economic activity. Given all that has happened in the US economy in the past two years or so, it is not surprising that Ireland should be adversely affected. Yet, we are still growing. We will grow at 3.5% next year in real terms. That is still a good performance by international standards. Some people here seem to be almost oblivious to international standards. They use every opportunity to talk down our economic success, social progress, and achievements as a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">If the power of negative thinking could achieve things, the country would be even more successful than it is. The true context for the Irish economic performance is as a small, open economy in Europe. We stand at near full employment and we are looking at economic growth of more than 3% next year. This compares favourably with the serious challenges facing other countries in the European Union. For example, in Belgium unemployment stands at almost 12% and growth next year will be approximately 1.8%; in Italy unemployment stands at 9% and growth next year will be approximately 1.8%; in France unemployment stands at 9% and growth next year will be approximately 1.8%; and in Germany unemployment is almost 10% and growth next year could be little more than 1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Germany has been supportive of Ireland in the past, funding much of the EU transfers that were so important to our development in recent years. Today it is more important to us as a market for our exports. It is also by far the biggest economy in the EU and, operating to its full potential, it should be the powerhouse of Europe. A vibrant and successful Germany, returning to strong and sustained growth, is essential for a vibrant and successful Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">We all have a powerful vested interest in the success of the German economy and those of the larger EU member states and a strong interest in the achievement of the goal set at the Lisbon EU summit to make the EU "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."  I am deeply convinced that this goal will be best served by low burdens of tax on job creation and enterprise and not by tax harmonisation in Europe. Given the choice between tax harmonisation and tax competition, I believe, as an economic liberal, that the interests, not just of Ireland, but of Europe will be best served by tax competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Tax competition will act as a force to keep tax rates down, and low tax rates encourage job creation and enterprise. The spectacular increase in employment in Ireland in the past number of years demonstrates how successful a low tax policy can be. Tax harmonisation would act as a force to increase tax rates and, therefore, a burden on job creation and economic growth. It is fundamentally important that individual member states should retain control over their own taxation policies and the Government will continue to argue its case in this regard at the European convention and at the subsequent intergovernmental conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I ask the business sector and all those concerned with sustaining employment and growth to bear in mind this fundamental building block of the Government's economic strategy in their assessment of this year's budget and the achievement of a 12.5% corporation tax rate. It is important that there should be an appropriate balance between income tax and tax on capital in total tax revenue and that there should be public understanding of that balance. The result of our tax reforms of recent years is that income tax as a percentage of total tax has fallen steadily and consistently from 36% to 31% in 2002. While we cut corporation tax and capital gains tax, their share of total tax revenue has substantially increased. Corporation tax provided 11% of the tax yield in 1996 whereas this year it will provide almost 18%. Capital gains tax provided two thirds of 1% of total tax in 1996 whereas now it provides 2.5%. These are the facts. Our reforms to cut taxes on income, enterprise and investment have stimulated jobs and growth. At the same time these reforms have increased the share of overall tax provided from capital, and decreased that provided by workers. This is a fair and sustainable fiscal and enterprise strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">There is no room for complacency in Irish economic policy. We have to be vigilant if we are to preserve and improve our competitive position in international markets. Fiscal policy has a key role to play in that process and yesterday's budget, like the five previous budgets, will help to secure the gains of recent years. The issue of competitiveness goes beyond fiscal policy, however, and a coherent approach to economic management is essential if we are to protect our prosperity and sustain our success.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">The Deputy knows as well as I do that we are the best performing economy in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">We are asking the taxpayer to fund a generous and significant increase in public service pay in 2003. The public service pay bill will increase by the order of €1 billion next year. The Government has a duty to taxpayers to ensure that full value is secured for that money and the report of the public service benchmarking body made it clear that implementation of its pay awards, apart from the first quarter, should be made conditional on agreement on modernisation and change issues in the public service. We need a public service that is efficient, flexible and responsive to the needs of a fast-changing and rapidly developing modern economy. The Government will, therefore, vigorously pursue a reform agenda with the public service unions in the context of the benchmarking negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It has become almost a cliché at this stage to say that investment in infrastructure is critical to the long-term success of the economy. Yesterday's budget included a major package of funding for infrastructure. Combined with the substantial allocation in the Book of Estimates this will push total financing for the national roads programme to record levels over the next three years. This represents a major boost to the national programme and it means that a significant portion of the new national network will be completed within the next three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Investment is not just about infrastructure, roads and railways. We must also invest in people and ideas, promote research and development, encourage better links between the academic world and the business world and ensure business and industry moves up the value chain, producing high-tech job opportunities for a highly qualified workforce.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">The benefits of market liberalisation are apparent in the economy.

The process of liberalisation still has a long way to go in this country. There is still considerable room for market opening in many sectors of the economy. The greater the progress we make on the liberalisation agenda, the more we will boost our international competitiveness and reduce inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">This is a fair and reasonable budget. It consolidates the progress of the last five years, copperfastens Ireland's position as the enterprise economy of Europe and puts the public finances on a sound and secure footing.

          <p eId="para_423">Nevertheless, we have kept very close to what we had forecast.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Deputy Broughan is right in one respect. The first step in framing this year's budget was the publication of the Estimates. The Government had two choices. We could dramatically raise taxes and therefore raise expenditure or we could control expenditure. There was no third choice, as is glibly and easily put forward by those on the other side, to get involved in an immense amount of borrowing. That choice did not exist for two reasons. First, it would be spending tomorrow's money today. Second, we are restricted by the rules of the EU growth and stability pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We did the prudent thing. We have increased public expenditure next year by 5.7%, which is ahead of the inflation rate, and we have managed to control it at that level. This is the most sensible thing to do when the economy is growing at a slow rate because world economies are totally stagnant. To do anything else would have been foolish.</p>

Therefore from the 1950s it was inevitable that the population of the west of Ireland would drop. We are now getting near to stability.

          <p eId="para_488">One of the most frightening comments yesterday was the Minister's admission that we have lost competitiveness in recent years. Our priority must be to halt the slide and maintain our position. Who was in Government in the past few years and who was in charge of finance but that same Minister, Deputy McCreevy? The Taoiseach says that the budget has to be understood in the context of two key facts. The first is that there are difficult economic circumstances. Only five months ago the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance made it clear that there were no problems and that there would be no cutbacks, either then or in the future. The Minister then said that, in a difficult time, we must fully protect the position of the weaker members of society, a point to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Consider Deputy Ó Cuív's comments on the budget. We all know, on the basis of his own admission, that he told the public of the dire straits the economy was in and that all sections had to cut back. What sections suffered most? Let me give the example from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan of an aged person in a private nursing home. The home was forced to do some repairs to satisfy the North-Eastern Health Board that its premises was up to the required standard and, as a result of that, had to increase its charges. An old age pensioner, an old lady at home in a country cottage, now has to pay €60 out of her pension to maintain her husband in the nursing home which, under normal circumstances, would be paid for by the health board. The health board told her it accepted that her case was beyond question but it was prevented from paying that €60 by the State and the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Another case relates to a poor lady who had a visit from a health board official to see if she was in continuing need of home help. She decided to show some pleasantness and courtesy towards the official so she made an all-out effort to make a cup of tea, thus proving that she was capable of doing so and therefore the decision made was that the ten hours of home help that she had been getting should no longer be made available to her. That gives some idea of how this Government brought the budget back into line. I wonder if that health board inspector's expenses or anything else were curtailed or if there were any cuts at a higher level in the health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I will make no apology for considering the position with regard to farming. I was born and reared on a farm and I declare my interest in farming. I was involved with farm organisations for 20 years and I am appalled when I see what is happening to farmers today. I do not blame the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, but I blame the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for either not being at the Cabinet or, if he was, for sitting back idly. The farming allocation has been cut by 9% overall. The 1% VAT increase hits farmers in the same way as everybody else. If there is an increase in VAT there should also be an increase in the VAT refund to unregistered farmers. When I asked the Minister about that yesterday he gave a clear "no", demonstrating total ignorance of the problems facing farmers today. The VAT increase will cost farmers and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In the Book of Estimates there was a 44% cut in the allocation for farm development and a 19% cut in the allocation for the REPS. The story now being put about by Fianna Fáil backbenchers is that it is not really a cut, the moneys were not taken up last year so we will have the same as what was spent last year or maybe even more. That may be so, but the reason that money was not spent last year is the system is tied up with red tape making it completely unworkable. When a farmer got a form to apply for a grant in the past, he or his wife could fill it out in five minutes. Now he must employ somebody to fill it, which costs money. This prevents people applying. For others, the difficulty in getting through regulations prevents them from applying. That must be re-examined</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Money must be made available for both farm development grants and REPS because if we are to deal with our commitments to Europe, as agreed in 1992, we will have to curtail pollution and deal with all the other issues pertaining to environmentally friendly farming. We should encourage those schemes, not take away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">One question that cannot be answered is why there is a 13% reduction in the allocation for Teagasc and Bord Bia. Teagasc, the advisory service, is facing this reduction at a time when farming is on its knees. I talked to one young farmer last Saturday week who has difficulties with red tape in terms of getting his installation aid. He is the only one of 13 in his group who has taken up farming at a time when five agricultural colleges have closed in three years. Does that show that we have ideas for the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In the Book of Estimates the levy for disease eradication has doubled. The cost of meat and bonemeal and BSE tests will be carried by the industry. On 9 December, next Monday, the Minister will call together the representatives of the meat industry but he should have done that at least three or four months ago when he might have put some money into farmers' pockets if he had been able to broker a deal between the two organisations rather than have pickets on factories. What he is doing is a cynical exercise when all the cattle are gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Over the past few days Ministers have asked us to suggest areas where savings can be made. As one who deals with the health section of farming, I believe there is one area which must be examined, and I requested this many months ago both through the committee structure and this House. BSE continues to be a major problem. Three hundred plus herds have been bought out this year. We no longer have markets in Egypt or many other countries. Therefore, where there is a breakdown of one animal in a herd, it cannot be justified that the State buys out the total herd. That herd may be replaced with animals from another country and we would have no knowledge of their health status. We know the health status of the other animals, at least the younger ones, and if those up to two years of age were left on the farm it would be easier for the farmer to get back into business. That whole area must be examined, and I do not say that for political reasons. I have seen the trauma experienced by those herd owners. It is worse than a death in a family to see one's whole herd going out the gate because one animal, which may not have even been reared on the farm, is infected. In the current economic downturn we should examine how we deal with problems instead of imposing increased disease levies on farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The rollover relief measure is another anxiety for farmers this morning. I am told there are whispers going around the House that land under compulsory order may not be included but I read the Minister's statement carefully and he said that rollover relief or loan notes would not be allowed for any purpose. In a radio interview with me this morning, my colleague in Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Brendan Smith, said that would be sorted out. I hope it is, for everybody's sake, because it was none other than the then President of the IFA, Tom Parlon, who won national acclaim for the great deal he brokered for farmers between the IFA and the Government in the run up to the election. He then went forward as a candidate and is now in this House as a watchdog. The Progressive Democrats said Fianna Fáil was not to be trusted and that it needed the Progressive Democrats in Government with them. The Progressive Democrats are with Fianna Fáil and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, if he is acting as a watchdog. Will he make sure that the promise he got from the then PD-Fianna Fáil Government is kept and that farmers will get their entitlement?</p>
          <p eId="para_498">There are also major implications arising from the drop in indexation in capital gains tax and the increase in stamp duty. Stamp duty increased automatically over the past number of years because of the massive increase in the value of property. I would have thought that was enough but to see it increased to 9% for virtually all significant property is an added burden on the transfer or purchase of property.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I welcome the €209 million granted to the National Roads Authority yesterday but €100 million or more of that will go back to the Government through increased VAT. We are looking at somewhere in the region of half of that amount in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Areas were selected under the national spatial strategy last week. My own towns of Cavan and Monaghan were included in that and they have requested funding from the National Roads Authority. If the national spatial strategy and the peace dividend to the Border region are to mean anything, moneys must be spent out of that €209 million in the Border region of Cavan-Monaghan. Of the three proposals in County Monaghan, Monaghan town is the most urgent, and I have already indicated that to the National Roads Authority. Obviously Cavan needs more funding to finish the bypass but if the junction from the roundabout to the Granard Road were completed, it would be a major boost. I urge that be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">It was interesting to hear the Tánaiste say that there was a commitment for a three year programme in the budget. I did not see that in the budget and I hope that matter will be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The 1% VAT increase will have other implications. It will have a major effect on house prices. A total of €3,800 was taken from first-time buyers last week and we now have €2,000 extra in VAT on the average first-time buyer's house. That means an increase of €5,800 in the cost of a house for first-time buyers. The small benefit in tax relief on interest will be welcome, but it is a long way from what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The 14 cent increase in diesel costs will have major implications for the haulage business and bus companies. These issues affect rural areas where there are no train services or other alternatives. This measure could put more hauliers out of business in addition to those who have already gone out of business because of increased insurance costs. The Minister concerned needs to seriously examine that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">On the schools building projects, <i>The Irish Times</i> named 400 schools the other day which will not be dealt with in the foreseeable future. They are “on hold”, to use the Civil Service language. These schools received promises last May that they would be dealt with quickly. They had no anxieties about cutbacks then but there are other schools which are not even on a list, and I will name some of those. Drumacruttin national school, on the edge of a major regional road, is working from a Portakabin and a hallway. Rackwallace is another school which does not even have an inside toilet. These are two-teacher schools in rural areas, so they do not matter. Knockconan school, in Emyvale, received a guarantee that it would be funded the week after the election, but that funding is now on hold. Ballyconnell school has operated for 35 years in a wooden hut, there is still no hope of a proper school being built. Darley, in Cootehill, desperately needs new structures. There is also Cavan No. 1, Lisboduff, in Cootehill, County Cavan, and the list goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Increases in various charges will be imposed at council level because of the cutbacks in funding to councils. What will happen as far as those in need are concerned? Five thousand civil servants will lose their jobs. Five thousand places on community employment schemes have already been cut. Will those who suffer most from those cuts be the disadvantaged? Will the cap on the recruitment of civil servants stop the appointments of all necessary personnel, including nurses, physiotherapists, etc.? What about the care of the disabled? Widows under the age of 66 are being badly treated. I could say much more about this harsh and uncaring budget. While the Minister has a commitment to the bloodstock industry and to others it does not extend to the poor.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_506">It is clear from their speeches that the members of the Government are using 1997 as the barometer by which to measure their record. At the time I was a Minster of State and I recently came across the budget speech I made at the time. It is revealing in the context of the position today. At that time the growth in output was more than 7%, compared with an output of 2.5% in the OECD. This year the growth in output will be 1.8% and it is expected to be 3.5% for the next two years. These figures reflect the buoyancy of the economy in 1997 and the prudent policies pursued by the rainbow coalition Government, which provided the platform for the many tax reductions and reforms implemented since then. In 1997, Ireland's GDP per head was approximately 100% of the European Union average, up from 76% in 1991. The effectiveness of the rainbow Government is clear from these statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The binge spending of the past two years has had a serious impact on the long-term competitiveness of the economy. People are paying with their jobs. The global employment figures, highlighting public sector recruitment, conceal the underlying picture of rapid employment losses in the private sector. In 1997, employment was growing at the rate of 1,000 jobs per week whereas today we are losing 500 jobs per week. Furthermore, because there is a credit squeeze, many companies will have to shed jobs in the coming year if they are to survive. I hope this will not happen but it is the feedback I am getting from various sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In a small open economy the Government's overriding duty is to protect competitiveness. This Government is in denial about its central role in allowing the erosion of competitiveness. Inflation here is double that in the eurozone. Approximately four or five years ago, when I was my party's junior spokesman on finance, the Minister was flippant in response to my concerns about rising inflation. He predicted that it would not rise. Yet, the increase in inflation has eroded our competitiveness, which, according to the OECD, has slipped by 11 places to 24th, or fifth from the bottom of the table. That is a serious situation, especially in terms of attracting international mobile investment. Much of the increase in inflation has been driven by increases in Government spending and the activities of the sheltered services sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">There is widespread evidence of the Government's failure to deliver on its central priority of maintaining economic progress. Ireland is way behind in terms of broadband connectivity and congestion costs are rocketing. For example, parcel delivery times in Ireland are the worst in Europe and are only exceeded by parcel delivery times in Calcutta. In addition, in the European Union, Ireland is generating the highest volume of waste per head and the lowest level of recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">There is mismanagement in all areas, accompanied by growth in spending with no results to show for it. Our quality of life has deteriorated and the prudence in evidence under the rainbow coalition Government has been dissipated. Had that Government been re-elected to office we would not be in this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Even before the budget the Government had increased numerous stealth charges. College registration fees have been considerably increased, excise duties on ATM and credit cards have increased, as has VAT on heat, housing and entertainment. The failure to index link income tax bands will result in inflation taking €500 from taxpayers. For example, a married person's tax credit should have increased by €152 to keep pace with the Minister's anticipated rate of inflation of 4.8% for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I am pleased the Minster for Social and Family Affairs is present. The Government has failed dramatically to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion persisting in the country. The budget has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, a gap which, according to Fr. Seán Healy of CORI, is now the worst in the European Union. Allowing for inflation, an unemployed couple with one child will be 25 cent better off in 2003 than in 2002. In 2002, they had an income of €241.43 per week and to compensate for the expected rate of inflation of 4.8% in 2003 they would have required a weekly increase in income of €11.59. Following the budget the income will increase by €11.84 per week. However, this does not take account of the stealth increases introduced by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The poverty gap between a single unemployed person and a person earning €50,000 per year will widen by more than €25 per week while the position of those living in relative income poverty will deteriorate. Unemployment assistance for single people will rise by €6 per week. The minimum rate of unemployment assistance in 2003 will rise to €124.80. It is not possible to live with any kind of dignity on this amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Children in receipt of child benefit will get a real increase of 54 cent per week. The child benefit increase of €8 brings that payment to €125.60 for the first and second child. However, the real value of the increase can be judged after taking account of the expected rate of inflation for 2003 of 4.8%, which erodes €5.64 from the overall increase. Consequently the post inflation increase in the monthly payment for children is €2.35 per month. This is equal to an increase of 54 cent a week or less than 8 cent a day. That will not buy much for those unfortunate children.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">My area of responsibility is tourism. The increase in VAT by 1% will have major effects on the tourism industry. The VAT rate in France is 5.5%, in Portugal is 7% and is about 5% across the eurozone in general. Because our rate is now 13.5% we will be less competitive for accommodation and meals. Ireland will be a less attractive destination next year. Electricity costs went up 14% and there will be an 8% increase next year. Insurance costs have risen from 40% to 200%, six times higher than the eurozone. Rates will be increased because of the rates support grant. Water and refuse charges will be increased. The tourism industry will be hard hit.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to take up the issue of capital allowances for hotels. That should be restored to a period of seven years so that owners can write off capital allowances over seven years. It is now extended to 25 years. It will be a total disincentive. I am involved in creating a package for a hotel in Ballybunion. One of the reasons we were pushing it was the capital allowance. This will stop it in its tracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The Minister of State was involved in negotiations for national primary roads in Kerry and he did a good job. The people who benefited through the sale of their land will not be allowed to roll it over. They will have to pay capital gains tax and I ask the Minister of State to examine this.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_518">Today is a good day to reaffirm my belief and commitment to what is the republican ideal and our resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts and cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The last Government led by Fianna Fáil oversaw monumental social and economic change in our country. We saw a huge appreciation in our economy and we spread those benefits among the people. We are caring for those less well able to look after themselves and cherishing the people who built our State by dramatically increasing pension payments. Health spending has doubled. Infrastructure spending resulted in new roads and the implementation of improved transport systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">What sort of a republic do I dream of? I dream of a republic that we are working to create for today and for our children tomorrow, one which is economically prosperous and yet socially just; a humane republic which serves the individual and which therefore holds the hope that citizens will serve it in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Those are the hopes I share with the playwright and first president of the Czech Republic, Mr. Havel, which he expressed in the springtime of nations as communism fell. He spoke of a republic of well-rounded people, "because without such it is impossible to solve any of our problems, human, economic, ecological, social or political."  When Fianna Fáil was founded 75 years ago those aspirations were in the minds of our founders. Those aspirations shape our political thought and that in turn shapes the policies and actions we implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">There has been a lot done. In my Department this budget will copperfasten social welfare payments and deliver increases to every weekly social welfare recipient. It will help to build further achievements. I agree that more has to be done. When we refuse to acknowledge that fact our country will stagnate, our economy will fall into decline and our country will be cursed with blight and decay. The day that happens I will say to the Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn Féin and Green Party coalition Government of the day that they were again given a chance and they failed to deliver to the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The spectacular economic performances of recent years have allowed us to make significant headway in many of the tasks that we set for ourselves and in promoting a caring society and the social inclusion of those who are weak and vulnerable. The progress which we have made is well worth protecting.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Social welfare spending rose by over €3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, well in excess of the rate of inflation—</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_526">When the Opposition had its opportunity it did not deliver either. There were false words and false pretences. Payment rates for recipients and their families have improved very considerably in real terms. Between 1997 and 2002 we increased the main payment for a pensioner couple by 50%. We started an unprecedented strategy to increase the level of resources devoted to child benefit so as to target the ills of child poverty and to allow parents to make their own choices. Significant structural improvements have been made to the social welfare system in the areas of unemployment and carer's allowances among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Our social inclusion strategy has borne fruit. Unemployment fell rapidly as economic growth and employment soared. The real incomes of those who were not able to avail of the increased opportunities from the Celtic tiger because of retirement, unemployment, sickness or disability, increased very significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Real improvements in social welfare in recent years have led to a halving of the consistent poverty measure. In 1994, the level of consistent poverty was 15.1% and this was reduced to 6% in 2000, the latest year for which figures are available. This Fianna Fáil Government is most anxious to protect the weak and vulnerable in our society and to safeguard the gains in building social inclusion. The Government is delivering an additional €833 million in social welfare spending next year, bringing the projected level of spending to over €10 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be €4.5 billion higher than it was in 1997, an increase of nearly 80%. The objectives of the social welfare package are to increase and maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms; to give additional increases to those aged 66 and over, in particular those on widow's and old age pension; to continue to increase pensions in line with the programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to €200 per week by 2007; to increase or maintain the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and to ensure that they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate; and to make significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">To this end, social welfare rates will take effect from the beginning of January 2003, providing an increase of €11 a week in the personal rate for widow and widower's contributory pension for people aged 66 and over; a €10 per week increase for all other pensioners aged 66 or over and 65 in the case of retirement and invalidity pension; and an increase of €7 for recipients of invalidity pension aged under 65, widow and widower's contributory pension, death benefit pension, carer's allowance for those under 66 years, carer's benefit and disablement benefit. There will be a €6 increase for all others aged under 66 and a proportionate increase for persons in receipt of reduced rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As I said, in our programme for Government we placed particular emphasis on payments to pensioners. There have been significant increases to date and we have made a commitment to reach €200 by 2007 for the lowest pension. This year the €10 increase makes a substantial first step towards meeting that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">We have also sought to assist the vulnerable older group of widows by giving an increase of €11. This targets resources at a group of older women where the risk of poverty can be high. A further priority in this budget was to protect the position of the less well off and we have sought to do this by ensuring the lowest payments are protected in real terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Child benefit will increase by €8 per month for each of the first two children in a family and €10 per month for the third and subsequent children bringing the rates up to €125.60 and €157.30 per month. By the spring of next year, child benefit rates will have risen by €71.64 per month since 2000 for each of the first two children and by €86.20 per month for the third and subsequent children. Due to budgetary circumstances, the planned increase in child benefit will be completed in 2004 and 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">This Government also sought to target resources at young families with children on low incomes, a group where the risk of poverty is high. We are doing this by increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by €30 for children aged 12 and over. We will also meet our PPF commitment to pay child dependent additions to persons in receipt of short-term payments for 26 weeks or more where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22. This is estimated to cost over €600,000 in a full year. We have also increased FIS income limits to ensure there remain incentives for people with families to take up employment. This will have a €5 million cost in a full year. Personal retirement savings accounts will be available early next year and this will provide a suitable opportunity to promote and encourage supplementary pension provision among workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">This budget has allocated resources with a view to running a Government sponsored information and awareness campaign to support the overall pensions strategy targeted at those most in need of cover. The campaign, which will be undertaken by the Pensions Board on behalf of the Government, will start next summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Over the past five budgets tremendous strides have been made to develop supports for family carers. I and my colleagues in Government are determined to keep moving forward, to continue to recognise the valuable work being done by family carers and to continue to build on the foundations put in place over the past five years. The means test for the carer's allowance has been eased significantly in recent budgets with the introduction of and numerous increases in the income disregards. I intend to again increase the disregards so that a single person can have a disregard of €210 and a couple can have a joint income disregard of €420. This measure will benefit 4,500 carers. It will increase the allowance currently received by 2,800 carers and will ensure that an additional 1,700 carers will qualify for a payment. This measure will come into effect in April 2003 at a cost of €5 million annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In October 2000 we introduced an innovative new social insurance scheme for carers. The carer's benefit scheme is for those who leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. This scheme is continually being reviewed, monitored and improved. It has already been relaxed this year by changing the definition of full-time employment from 19 hours per week to 17 hours per week. Another condition for receiving carer's benefit is that while the carer may work up to ten hours per week, he or she may not earn more than €95. I now intend to further improve the carer's benefit scheme by increasing the income ceiling from €95 to €150 per week. This measure will serve to provide additional income for carers and will keep the carer in touch with his or her workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Introducing the annual respite care grant was an innovation greatly appreciated by many of those who benefit from it. The grant which currently stands at €635 or €1,270 for carer's caring for more than one person will increase by €100 to €735. Carers caring for more than one person will now receive €1,470. The grant will be paid in June 2003 to recipients of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and carers who are providing full-time care and attention for those who are in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or the prescribed relative's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Recognising that next year is the European Year of People with Disabilities, I want to make further progress in the area of payments of disability allowance to persons in residential care. One of the qualifying conditions applying to the former disabled person's maintenance allowance was that the payment could not be made to people in residential care or in hospital. People in these situations had their maintenance costs and, in some cases, an allowance met through funding from the Department of Health and Children and/or the appropriate health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">In the case of all other social welfare benefits and allowances, including payments to people who are sick or disabled such as disability benefit and invalidity pension, entitlement to payment is not affected by the residential status of the claimant. Therefore, on the takeover of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme in 1996, claimants of disability allowance in residential care were treated differently from other categories of social welfare recipients in similar circumstances. Since the takeover of the DA scheme a number of measures have been introduced to progressively relax this disqualification, including an improvement introduced in 1999 whereby existing DA recipients living at home can retain their entitlement when they subsequently go into hospital or residential care. The net effect of these changes is that many of those previously disqualified for payment under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme because they were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the disability allowance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The complete abolition of this disqualification would be difficult to achieve in one single move and it also has implications for the health board funding arrangements for people in full-time residential care. However, as a way of making further progress in this area, it has been agreed in principle that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will now take over responsibility for the allowances currently being paid or funded by the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I propose to establish a working group representative of the various interests to examine the issues that would be involved in the takeover from the health boards of the allowances paid to persons with disabilities in residential care, including the possible standardisation of such allowances. The budget has provided for additional funding to facilitate this process. In view of the level of work necessary to identify the people involved, I envisage that I will not be in a position to announce a specific timetable in this area until the end of 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">It was not that long ago. The Deputy is not that much younger than me.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Having put in the time on this worthy, if somewhat heavy tome, it seems thoroughly appropriate that I should now be the Minister to tackle one of the last remaining outstanding recommendations of the report – the benefit and privilege rule. Currently, the assessment of means for unemployment assistance for claimants living in the parental home takes account of the value of benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant. In practice, the value of board and lodging is taken into account. The CSW recommended its abolition for persons aged 25 and over. I am taking a first step in this direction by the abolition of this assessment for persons aged 29 and over. It is estimated that the cost of this measure will be in the region of €750,000 and will benefit 1,300 persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Voluntary housing bodies play an important role in providing rental housing throughout the country for people who could not otherwise afford to provide suitable accommodation from their own resources. In many cases the tenants are pensioners, disabled or unemployed people. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, through the local authorities, operates a number of schemes to assist voluntary housing bodes. In determining the rents they charge, voluntary housing bodies are expected to have regard to the tenants' means and the cost of providing and maintaining the dwelling after allowing for the substantial funding provided by the State. Rents are, therefore, below market rents. SWA rent supplement may be payable in these cases subject to the standard means test and also subject to a maximum payment of €36.82 per week in the case of a single person and €39.36 a week in other cases. This in turn limited the level of rent that could be charged by voluntary housing bodies with a consequential negative impact over time on their financial viability in some cases. This measure will increase these limits to €40 and €45 per week. Up to 1,500 tenants, mainly pensioners and single unemployed people, will benefit in the first instance. However, the longer-term impact will be to improve the financial viability of voluntary housing schemes operated by voluntary organisations. This will encourage more provision, enabling these and other voluntary housing bodies to provide a service to a greater number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">An additional €1 million has been allocated in the budget to the Family Support Agency bringing the total budget to €17.25 million on a full year basis. This new agency, which I propose to establish shortly, will provide a comprehensive response for families in need of support services and for families generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Government initiative in establishing the Family Support Agency and the passing of the legislation was widely welcomed and I am delighted that the expectations about the role of the new agency and its role in enhancing national and local provision for families are high.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">This additional funding which I am providing will ensure that the agency is well positioned to develop the functions for which it has statutory responsibility and to inform the development of Government policy in family matters. I will announce at a later stage the specific details of the improvements that underlie the budget package.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">While the circumstances in which I formulated my first package as Minister for Social and Family Affairs have been far from auspicious, we have sought to protect the less well off in our society while making progress towards our objectives. We have sought to increase or maintain the value of all personal rates of payment in real terms by increasing them by a minimum of €6 per week and in many cases by more.</p>

According to the model, the budget measures result in falls in the numbers below each of the main relative income poverty lines. Similar results were also found by the Department of Finance in its analysis of the entire budget package.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">If an old age pensioner happens to like a tipple of spirits, which he or she would be quite entitled to do at this time in his or her life and which is good for the soul as well as the body, the increase in the price of a measure of spirits will cut into that pensioner's increase in benefit. The increase in the widow's and widower's contributory pension is only €1.55 per day. The increase in the maximum weekly personal rate for recipients under 66 is only €1 per day. All these increases contained in the glossy budget document sound great, but one must break them down in terms of what they will mean to the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">There is also the increase in VAT and how it will impact on a series of services. When account is taken of the 1% increase in VAT, the increase in the price of diesel and the series of increases across the board, people will end up not getting an increase but a reduction in their income. It is sad that should be the case at Christmas. Normally people get an increase in terms of the delivery of some promises but unfortunately on this occasion promises have not been delivered, they have been scuppered.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The increase in the qualified adult payments works out at about 55 cent or 56 cent per day. With regard to the increase in child benefit, I know the Government espouses the great importance of the family.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">—I would not allow myself to dwell too long on taking that course.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Essentially, the budget piles more taxation on people who are now about to experience an economic downturn which was brought about by the mismanagement of the country's finances. That is the short and simple reason for it. We should be cutting taxes to restore and boost the economy when it is faltering. Government Members have told us how bad the world economies are, so now is the time to boost our economy by cutting taxes. Now is the time to give the financial injection that is required and to restore the people's confidence in this country, its economy and, dare I say it, in this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The Government, however, has decided to penalise the people. It has penalised the consumer by increasing VAT. It has also penalised the motorist and the transport industry. With regard to agriculture, it is amazing that the main Government party, which would claim to be the farmer's friend, gives just one line in the budget to training young farmers for the future. I do not know what that future is. I have been putting down parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the last ten years about the future of agriculture but the Minister does not seem to have an answer. I am sure the two Ministers who are present would like to get the answer to that question. If they have it, I am sure we will hear it before the debate is over. We have not heard it yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">One of the most glaring issues to face this country in the last five years is housing. Over 100 years ago Michael Davitt fought a land war to achieve for people the right to own their own home. This right is indelibly imprinted in the minds and hearts of Irish people. I do not know how we have lost our way so soon in that regard. We have become the victims of an attempt by Government to change the philosophy of the Irish people away from the right to owning their own home to paying rent to some investor or landlord.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_610">That is the privilege facing the new generation. In my constituency at present no middle income person has a hope in hell of buying his or her own home. The budget underlines this yet again. Their only hope is to pay the mortgage of a financial institution which owns a property or block of apartments or to pay a landlord who is an investor. There is no other way of getting a home. The maximum loan available through the local authorities or through a combination of the local authorities and some other system is at least €70,000 short of the market price of a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I have sought an explanation for this through parliamentary questions. Ministers raise their eyebrows and look at me as if I had two heads. They do not seem to understand that in the greater Dublin area at present the only recourse the young generation has, and this includes people on middle incomes, is to leave. Some of them have gone to England, to Liverpool and other places, to buy homes and commute to Ireland to work. I do not know why that has happened. If Michael Davitt were alive, he would have something to say about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">It is amazing that the Celtic tiger seems to have generated something that is totally alien to our culture. When there were no jobs at home we went abroad to work. We had homes but could not live in them because there were no jobs. Now, we cannot exist at home because we have no home. We must live abroad and come back to this country to work. It is crazy. The Minister seems to dismiss what I am saying. She should do some research. She will find that what I am saying is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">In the greater Dublin area, which includes Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, people in the middle income bracket are now applying for council houses, which the Government is not providing. The Government does not seem to think that people need housing any more. If that is not bad enough, there are now more homeless people in this city than in the city of London. Surely somebody in the Government can explain that. Surely one of the various handlers, spin doctors, experts and therapists of every description which the Government employs should be able to study the statistics and arrive at the reason for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I can give the reason. There has been a deliberate policy to exclude people from the market. The people who were usually able to buy or build their own homes or to otherwise house themselves are no longer wanted. That generation has been frozen out of the market and has nowhere to go. Unless the Government cops onto itself, these people will have to leave the country permanently. That is a disgrace. We have heard a great deal about so-called affordable housing. The policy never worked. There were 300 or 400 houses built in five years. That is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">There are simple ways of solving the housing problem. What the Government has forgotten and under-emphasised over the last number of years is the price of housing. It has forced the unfortunate people who did buy houses and spent between €200,000 and €250,000 for them into a situation where they have a millstone around their necks for the next 20 years. It is a millstone that is twice the cost of the average house in most neighbouring jurisdictions. Why is this so? Is it because people feel better or the Government believes they should feel better if they live in a more expensive house? It makes no difference to the people living in the house. However, it is important for investors and the Government has based its economic policy heavily on low interest rates, which should be of benefit to the country, and the recognition that investors will invest in property. Investors will be happy because there will be a huge recompense from investment in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">In my constituency, an ordinary, basic three bedroom house can cost up to €2,000 per week to rent and a four or five bedroom house up to €3,000 per week. There is nothing unusual about this. Those afflicted by the shortage of housing are the only people who understand this. I cannot understand why the Government has done nothing about it. If this happened to any other sector in society, there would be marches in the streets and everything would come to a halt. The Government has failed dramatically to respond in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I am saddened by the issue of the health service, although I should not be sad at Christmas. Despite the fact that we have been told that expenditure in this area has been massively increased in recent years and we have a ten year plan to improve it further, for some unknown reason the number of administrators in the service has increased dramatically and their pay and conditions have also been similarly improved. Some of the positions did not exist before but they do now and in large numbers. However, the delivery is worse than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Various people have examined our health service. The French are supposed to have the best health service in the world. The Government should send some of the spin doctors in its employment to France to examine the system there to discover how it is done so that we can cut out the nonsense in which we have been engaged of placating those in the service here and not improving delivery to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">A considerable period was spent earlier discussing education. This area is a disgrace after five years of unprecedented economic growth. Children throughout the country attend substandard schools where health and safety requirements are not observed because the Government has decided to ignore them. Would any Member live and work in the conditions in which teachers and children must live and work in some schools throughout the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The Minister for Education and Science was asked before the election what he would do for such schools and the reply was that the Government had spent more in this area than any other since the foundation of the State. We thought after the general election that money would flow again from the coffers to improve the pupil-teacher ratio. We thought it was a natural follow-on from the Celtic tiger. In the run-up to the election, all indications were that this was what one could expect. We were sorely disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">What followed the general election was a flop. The Fosbury flop technique developed by a certain gentleman in the high jump in the Olympics has been surpassed by the Government. After the general election, not only did the suggestions of the Government, veiled and otherwise, fail to come true, they were reversed. I do not understand how any Government in an economy which was supposedly the envy of the world failed to recognise the importance of the pupil-teacher ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I am sad for the Government, although I know one should not be, because it has whittled away and spent the surplus. However, I feel sad for its members, individually and collectively, and I know my sadness will grow as time goes by. I know one should not feel sad for people who had so much to give and gave so little, especially at Christmas. I know we should not feel sad about that, but a tear runs down my cheek when I think about them.</p>

He is no longer the quiet Minister in that Department who, like other Ministers, confines himself to his portfolio, dealing with crime on the streets, muggings, killings, rapes and shootings. We expect the Minister to confine himself to that area but he has decided to deal with the country's finances and the broader landscape. He is encompassing within his portfolio issues that were previously only spoken about in hushed tones by Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">What makes this a sad time after five years of Government by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is not only that they have failed to deliver but the way they have failed and the way they conned the people into believing there was more to come.

I know she loves to hear this issue raised, especially in the context of the cost to industry, householders, the country and the economy in terms of competitiveness. I know this issue is not straightforward, but something is wrong. Unlike Europe or America, we are not required to be to the fore in terms of world defence, yet for some unknown reason, if something happens elsewhere, we are suddenly in the frontline in terms of increases in insurance costs. Something more must be done. The Government's slogan, "A lot done, more to do", never applied more aptly to this issue. The Tánaiste will deal with it in detail on Question Time so I will not pursue the matter further. I raise it because it is hugely important and critical for the economy and our competitiveness in international markets. Nothing has been done to address the issue although it could have been done in the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">They informed me of Elan's intention to purchase the site, which subsequently happened in March 2002 for a sum of €6 million. I was advised of the company's plans to expand its manufacturing facility into Macroom. That was good news because we had been endeavouring to find a suitable investor for the Macroom facility following the closure of General Semiconductor.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">Was the Minister aware that a couple of days before the general election, there was an article in the local newspaper – and I am aware of the ruling in the House in the matter – in relation to the fact that Elan was to create 200 jobs in Macroom? The Taoiseach made a fast car journey to Macroom in order to make sure he announced these jobs. These jobs were announced in the presence of a well-known friend of the Taoiseach, Elan's Mr. Geaney, and in the presence and with the collusion of the director of elections for Fianna Fáil, Mr. P.J. Mara, who is a public affairs consultant for Elan Corporation. In view of the fact that the board of Elan Corporation had not approved the project, does the Minister think this is unusual practice? Given that she knew this project was going to happen in Macroom and that she was notified by the Taoiseach's Department that he was going to make this announcement, what did she do about stopping him from doing that because it was not a bona fide announcement <i>per se</i>? No approval was given by the board of Elan Corporation. It was unusual that the company did not apply to the IDA for any grant assistance. It was at a time when the shares of Elan Corporation had plummeted.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">I would not be privy to what decisions have been made by the board of a company. Frequently the board of a company would not be aware of plans made by part of its operations. Subsidiaries of companies can invariably make decisions in relation to their activities that would not formally go to the board. In January 2002 the IDA made the company aware of what kind of grant aid might be available in the event of a business plan being forthcoming. I do not accept a company would spend in the region of £5 million or about €6 million to become part of a PR stunt.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">When Mr. Geaney came to see me I was in no doubt it was a bona fide project and it was treated with the kind of seriousness that a project of that kind should receive. The chief executive of the IDA would not lightly bring a person to see me to discuss a project if we did not believe it was a serious project. It was a serious project and that is why the company acquired the site. It has not disposed of the site yet. A site in Macroom is not as lucrative or as easy to dispose of as a site in a more populated area.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Circumstances changed enormously for the company between the initial intention in the earlier part of this year and subsequent events that occurred over the summer and since then in relation to the company's fortunes. I hope that Elan Corporation recovers, because it was a successful company, employing huge numbers of people in this country. It reached high levels on the stock exchange both here and elsewhere. It was a flagship as far as Irish enterprise was concerned.</p>

      the main features of the redundancy and severance package offered to employees of Irish Fertilizer Industries; if her attention has been drawn to the serious disappointment expressed by the employees at the contents of the package; the steps she intends to take to address these concerns; the reasons it was decided to place the company in a voluntary creditors' liquidation, rather than a members' voluntary liquidation, as recommended by the board; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [25189/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_668">Former workers in IFI will get their full statutory redundancy entitlements and I can confirm that my Department is aiming to issue payments in respect of such entitlements before Christmas in respect of valid claims received to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">In addition, the shareholders have established a special <i>ex gratia</i> severance fund with almost €24.5 million for the workers. When combined with statutory entitlements there will be a total of more than €35 million available. This is sufficient to provide average payments of about €57,000 per worker. At this stage, most of the workers have received an interim payment of €5,000 from the fund to help them in the short-term pending the determination of the basis for the distribution of the available funds. It will be for the <i>ex gratia</i> fund's trustee to decide, after consultations with employee representatives, how payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">While I am aware of the workers' views on the adequacy of the package, both the Government and ICI believe that in setting up the <i>ex gratia</i> fund they are providing severance arrangements which are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Employees are also free to pursue with the liquidator any legal entitlements, which they may feel they have to redundancy payments, though any payments in that respect would be offset by the amount of any payment from the <i>ex gratia </i>fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">In order to allow it to opt for a members' voluntary liquidation, the IFI board concluded that it would have needed the shareholders to provide, in effect, an open-ended guarantee in respect of the payment of all liabilities, including any contingent or prospective liabilities, within a period of 12 months. Apart from covering any deficit, regardless of size, which might arise in the liquidation, this would also have required the shareholders to provide significant funds to the liquidator pending the realisation of assets. In the circumstances, neither shareholder felt it could provide such an open-ended commitment on top of the significant support given to the company over the years, including the provision of €34 million recently. In any event, ICI was of the view that it would have had to put a proposal for such a form of indemnification to its shareholders for approval and the State would have needed legislative approval for such a course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">However, it should be noted that by agreeing in principle, to subordinate loans of more than €34 million in favour of the other creditors, the position of those creditors is significantly improved. In addition, the provision of funds for <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payments should also help ensure an orderly liquidation, which is in the interests of all parties.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_674">Is the Minister aware that workers employed in the Belfast IFI plant have a binding and legally enforceable contract, which has been accepted by Mr. Jackson, the receiver, as entitling them to between three and four and a half weeks' payment per year of service?</p>
          <p eId="para_675">This contrasts with the two weeks per year of service being offered in the so-called package put together by the Government and its co-owner, ICI. Does she accept there is clear discrimination between workers in the same company who happen to live in a different jurisdiction? Specifically, what plans does she have to ensure all workers are treated not only fairly but equally? Does she not accept that it is an unsustainable position to allow workers in the Belfast plant to get between three and four and a half weeks severance pay per year of service while workers in the Republic receive a mere two weeks severance pay?</p>

          <p eId="para_676">The workers in the Republic, to use the terminology used by the Deputy, will get three to three and one quarter weeks severance pay, inclusive of statutory pay.</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_678">Most workers in the North are entitled, inclusive of statutory payments, to three weeks severance pay – four and a half weeks in certain circumstances – subject to a maximum of 90 weeks. On this basis, the balance due, if any, after the statutory <i>ex gratia</i> payment is likely to be small in most cases. As the Deputy will be aware, there are also significant differences in pension entitlements. I am not certain workers in Arklow and Marina Point would wish to substitute their pension entitlements for those the workers in Belfast are likely to get. I am aware of the information to which the Deputy referred regarding the legal advice obtained by the workers in Belfast and I understand it has been accepted by Mr. Jackson.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_679">The Minister has now accepted there will be a disparity between the severance package available to workers in Arklow and Cork and that available to former employees of IFI in Belfast. Does she accept that this is not a sustainable position? Does she further accept that the notion that people whose pensions are now in jeopardy should feel better off in the Republic because they have a slightly greater prospect of their pensions being funded than their co-workers in Belfast is an appalling reaction given that the people in question are being put out of work after decades, in some cases, of loyal service to a company?</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_680">As I stated, I am not certain the workers in Belfast will receive much more than workers here once the statutory payment is included. In any event, they will become unsecured creditors and will have to pursue their entitlements in the context of what the liquidator may have left over after the secured creditors have been dealt with. While we all wish circumstances had been different with IFI, unfortunately this was not to be. However, given the circumstances, the Government and the other shareholder, ICI, have made a reasonable sum of money available to pay on average about €57,000 per worker. Some will receive much more than this while others will receive much less. In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I find this fair and reasonable. I gave an undertaking to the trade unions during our meeting that if there are moneys left over after the liquidation has been completed we will be willing to reconsider the position as regards the workers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_692">The whole objective of community employment schemes is to allow for progression to sustainable employment. We are anxious that everybody on community employment schemes, irrespective of his or her age or level of disadvantage, is given the training and the opportunity to progress to a full-time job. We accept there are people who face a more difficult challenge in terms of progression due to age, disability or another disadvantage. Part of the review will be to consider alternative opportunities for such people. As I stated in a recent debate, the review is examining ways of keeping people over the age of 55, particularly those living in areas where there are no job opportunities, on community employment schemes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_693">My point is that the only progression these people are making is to return to the live register. Another type of scheme is, therefore, essential. Does the Minister of State realise that most available jobs are in larger centres and people in rural areas with no access to public transport find it extremely difficult to get jobs when they leave the community employment scheme? Due to the new restrictions being introduced in the area of social welfare they also find it difficult to get unemployment assistance. Given the significant cutbacks imminent in local government it is important that we have schemes to support the voluntary work of community groups. Does the Minister consider that a new form of social employment scheme would offer a way of addressing this major problem?</p>

          <p eId="para_694">I do not accept additional restrictions are being imposed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The same criteria apply to people coming off community employment schemes as have always applied. We must remember that community employment schemes are temporary contracts, not full-time jobs for life. The success of community employment has been that it is flexible and that people must leave it, which may mean going on the live register for a period. All of this is under review. Moreover, the labour market programme will no longer be the only policy area as the review will, for the first time, examine the potential for community employment schemes to provide a proper community service on a long-term basis. We have to ensure this community service is provided effectively and cost efficiently. This area will form part of the review and will be a feature of the policy change being undertaken by my Department in association with other Departments and FÁS.</p>

      <b>Mr. Howlin</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
      the reason for the cuts of ?100 million in the FÁS training and integration supports and employment programmes in regard to her Department's Estimates for 2003; the way in which this major funding cutback will impact on FÁS services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [25190/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_700">The overall allocation to FÁS in 2003 for training and employment measures is €660 million compared to an allocation of €714 million in 2002, a reduction of just under €54 million, not €100 million as suggested in the question. In 2003 the direct Exchequer contribution of €73.518 million is complemented by a €222.055 million contribution from the national training fund, bringing the overall investment in FÁS training initiatives to €295.573 million. This compares to €301.018 million in 2002 which means that overall investment in this area is being maintained at close to 2002 levels. This will result in a modest reduction in training places in 2003. FÁS will prioritise, in so far as possible, the training and employment supports for the disabled within their overall allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Government's commitment to the central role played by training in underpinning competitiveness is further demonstrated by the recently launched in-company training scheme which will provide €45 million between now and the end of 2006 in training and upskilling the labour force. This ESF funded initiative will be co-financed mainly by the private sector. The allocation for 2003 to FÁS employment programmes, which includes community employment, is set at almost €365 million as against €413.4 million in 2002. The 2003 allocation will support an average community employment participation level of around 22,000 throughout next year with a closing participation rate of about 20,000. It also includes an average job initiative programme participation level of around 2,500 throughout the year with an end of year participation level of about 2,200. Commitments entered into in respect of social economy programmes approved to date are also included.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The board of FÁS, taking account of Government policy guidelines, will decide on the detailed priorities and breakdown of funding between schemes and activities from within these overall allocations.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">Does the Minister accept that with an inflation rate of 5%, in order to stand still the real requirement amounts to a cut of €100 million for this year? Does she also accept that her personal antipathy and that of her party to community employment schemes has reduced the total numbers in the current year by 5,000? Does she further accept that it is her intention to reduce it by a further 5,000 places next year? Within a two year period that amounts to a reduction of a third. This will have devastating effects on communities and individuals whose dignity has been restored by these schemes. Will she explain her antipathy to one of the most important and universally applauded schemes since it was introduced to the labour market by my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Quinn?</p>

          <p eId="para_704">I do not accept what the Deputy says. I work very closely with a large number of community employment schemes both in my constituency and elsewhere. I witness at first-hand the enormous work that is being done. Essentially, today it is a community service.</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_706">It is no longer merely a labour market measure. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has already dealt with the issue in reply to a previous question.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">We are putting more people through training, particularly more young people, so they can access a job in the labour market at a time when there is huge pressure here to bring in immigrant labour, an area I will deal with in the next reply. It makes more sense to put people through formal training where they can access a job. The Cabinet recently established a sub-committee of which the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is a member. It reviews not just the operation of community employment but of other schemes of this kind so that we can have a sensible policy as we go forward. The aim is to maintain community services and provide much needed activity and experience as well as some element of training for those in our society who are not in a position to access a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">In the past five years, the number of people on long-term unemployment dropped from over 90,000 to just under 22,000. When the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, introduced community employment as a successor to social employment, there was one community employment place for every six long-term unemployed people. Today there are more people on community employment, thankfully, than there are on long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">We have to respond to these changes in the context of the budgetary situation in which we find ourselves. If we had not got money from the training fund, the numbers might have gone down further. There are very few discretionary elements in my Departments budget. In the initial round of funding that was suggested for my Department by the Department of Finance for next year we were faced with a scenario where we might not have succeeded in getting money out of the training fund to give to FÁS to support some of its activities. I am delighted we were successful in doing that and I hope we will be able to keep as many people as possible on community employment and also in training.</p>

       her views on the fact that 200,000 immigrants require to be facilitated in order to fill job vacancies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_720">The figure of 200,000 immigrants from overseas being needed in the period 2000-06 originated in the report of the interdepartmental group on immigration policy presented in early 2000 based on the growth projections contained in the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Rates of economic growth, employment growth and immigration have been higher than expected in the early years of the national development plan. Immigration has taken place on a very large scale in recent years. A total of 105,807 work permits and working visas were issued to non-EEA nationals in the period 1999 to 2002 to date. This is in addition to inward immigration from elsewhere in the EU and Irish nationals returning from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Inward migration in the next few years will clearly be governed by the rate of economic growth. All indications suggest that there will be a continuing need for overseas workers but not at the rate experienced in the period of exceptionally high growth. We are continually monitoring developments in the labour market and adjusting the criteria and procedures for the issuance of work permits and visas to reflect changing conditions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_723">The Minister announced on 4 March 2000, that 200,000 extra workers would be required to implement the national development plan. There may be some duplication in the figure of 105,807 she has given as people have to re-apply for their permits. That is my understanding of how the system operates in regard to work permits.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">When will the Minister have an immigration policy in place? When will the statutory footing for the work permit system be introduced in the Dáil? Does she have any plans to bring forward the introduction of the skills-based selection system?</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_725">The skills-based scheme is already in place. Some 6,000 to 7,000 have come on to it. They are people in the ICT sector, nurses and building professionals. Clearly, there have been fewer in the ICT sector in recent times because of the downturn in the area but we have had a large number of nurses and other medical workers from overseas. It has been extended to other medical categories as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The Deputy is correct in what he said about the number of work permits. The number of renewals is rising all the time and this year may be in the region of 40%. The figures I gave do not include those who are coming from other European countries. It is suggested that we have as many as 80,000 foreign workers in this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The legislation is imminent and should be ready in the early part of next year. We have an immigration policy. I recently got FÁS involved because of the huge growth in the number of work permits so that we could have a system on the ground to assess whether people were available in localities to fill the jobs. I intend, shortly, to make it even more strict to ensure that employers use locally available labour.</p>

Much of the reform involves the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport. The recommendation on renewal notices has been implemented and the penalty points system is in place. The insurance companies themselves have implemented some recommendations but the timeframe for the implementation of all the recommendations is the middle to end of next year. By this time next year I hope the vast majority of the recommendations will be in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">Will the Minister agree to an independent examination by an Oireachtas committee of the proposal to establish a personal injuries assessment board? My concern is that we may drive up a blind alley and I am not sure whether it is a good idea. There is a danger it might be a bad idea as it could add to the cost of insurance. No cost benefit analysis supports the case for a PIAB. The only economic analysis has been conducted by Dr. Peter Bacon, who has suggested the cost of claims and, therefore, the cost of insurance will be higher if such a board is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I make a plea to the Minister to have the issue examined by an Oireachtas committee and the heavyweights from the interim board, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Irish Insurance Federation, can be brought before it. If the proposal stands up to rigorous scrutiny I will run with it but, in the meantime, I remain a sceptic. I emphasise that I am a non-practising lawyer. There are dangers in this proposal that have not been adequately examined and if it stands up to scrutiny I will support it. However, until it does I consider it a dangerous course of action to follow.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">The PIAB is only one minor part of the overall solution to the problem. If it was not accompanied by the other reforms, it could add to the cost of insurance, as the Deputy suggested, and make it easier for people to make claims. All paper-based systems have such potential. I have no problem with an Oireachtas committee examining the proposal but we are proceeding with it. We have set up an interim board and a great deal of work has been done by Dorothea Dowling and her colleagues in preparation for the establishment of the board on a statutory basis. I do not accept it will add to the cost because, if it did, we would not proceed. Without the other reforms, the proposal could not succeed on its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I accept the Deputy's bona fides, notwithstanding his professional background, and I am aware the legal profession has raised significant objections. However, a non-court based procedure for the settlement of claims, 40% of the cost of which is accounted for in professional fees, would be more successful and less expensive.</p>

      asked the

      her views on whether a strategy which allows tax breaks for corporate research and development expenditure would have significant benefits in promoting higher value added industries here; and if her Department will initiate a study to show the way in which such tax breaks could be operated.
      [25109/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_768">The level of research and development undertaken by business in Ireland is low for an economy whose output and exports are dominated by high technology sectors. Ireland's business expenditure on research and development (BERD), at around 0.9% of GDP (1% of GNP), is well below the OECD average of 1.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Ireland's manufacturing output is now dominated by sectors that require high research and development intensity to remain competitive. As regards the foreign-owned sectors, it is clear that much of the research activity which underpins the employment, output and exports in Ireland is conducted overseas and not in Ireland. This is a significant weakness that I believe must be addressed. The share of indigenous manufacturing output devoted to research and development has remained static at 0.9% between 1995 and 1999 compared to an OECD average of 2.4%. However, within that overall number eight indigenous sub-sectors have research and development intensities that exceed the OECD average.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I am very conscious of the need to foster a more knowledge-intensive economy in order to provide a sustainable long-term basis for growth in employment and incomes. I accept that this will require, among other things, a substantial increase in public and private investment in research and development. The major State investment now under way to strengthen public research infrastructure and capabilities needs to be complemented by a sustained rise in business research and development expenditure, particularly among foreign firms in high-technology sectors whose research intensity lags far behind that in other advanced economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Tax incentives are widely used to stimulate business research and development in other advanced economies, and their effectiveness in doing so has been established by a series of empirical studies, particularly among large firms in high-technology sectors. Internationally, the provision of fiscal incentives for research and development has increased significantly in recent years, and 18 OECD member states now provide tax credits or enhanced tax allowances for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Against this background a group involving Forfás, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and my Department, with commissioned input from KPMG, has, over the course of this year, undertaken a detailed analysis of strategic and operational issues surrounding fiscal incentives for R&amp;D in Ireland. This has now come to hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">I thank the Minister for her reply. I did not mention the issue of the corporation tax rate in my question. I was afraid I might scare some of my Opposition colleagues. Rather than relying on a low corporate tax rate as our investment and enterprise strategy should we not take a more flexible approach and mix a higher corporation tax rate with grants or tax write-offs for research and development expenditure? This would be a better long-term business investment strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Does the Minister agree that this route should be considered and possibly supported? Will the Minister give more details of the report she received from the study group? Will it be made available to the House and will Members have an opportunity to discuss the issue? This is one of the key issues in our long-term industrial development strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Does the Minister agree that a higher rate of corporation tax, if it were flagged in advance and introduced gradually, might be a successful long-term tax strategy? This may be a strange thing to ask the day after corporation tax was lowered from 16.5% to 12.5%.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_454">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_776">No, I would not agree with that but I agree with much of what the Deputy says. Low corporate tax rates tend to discourage research and development which tends to take place in countries which have higher corporate tax rates, for obvious reasons. Our low corporate tax rate delivers approximately 18% of the tax take. Rates three times higher in the rest of Europe on average contribute approximately 5% or 6% of the tax take. We get more from the lower rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Having a lower corporate tax rate as standard is not inconsistent with having tax credits for research and development. The study was undertaken to see how we could introduce it in a way that was additional and would not merely allow companies to move work over that they would do anyway. When the Government and the Minister for Finance have considered the matter I will be delighted to make the study available to Deputies. It is a matter which would have to be considered in the context of the Finance Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I cannot understand the Minister's logic in bringing in tax credits as well as maintaining the low rate of corporate tax which could, in effect, give some businesses a zero rate. In the interest of equity and revenue raising we must take some tax from corporate profits. We cannot provide tax credits without increasing the tax in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Nineteen or 20 other countries are doing this at present. It would not be a significant scare to international investors if it were flagged and gradually introduced. I find it hard to believe the Minister is considering bringing in further tax credits as well as the low rate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_456">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_780">The United Kingdom, which has a low rate of corporate tax although higher than ours, recently brought in a tax credit system for research and development. We must have flexibility in this regard. I am not talking about companies paying no tax. The introduction of a tax credit would have to be ring-fenced around additional expenditure in genuine research and development, which is extremely expensive. It is, perhaps, more expensive in Ireland than in some countries because of our higher wage costs. That is why we must engage seriously in research and development if we are to remain successful in the future. We will not be successful simply making other people's products or converting other people's ideas into products. We must generate and innovate.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">That is one of the reasons Science Foundation Ireland was established. Notwithstanding the cuts in expenditure in my Department this year of more than 5%, Science Foundation Ireland's budget has doubled for that precise reason.</p>

      <b>Mr. Hogan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
      the action she will take to ensure a company (details supplied) continues to trade at Castlecomer, County Kilkenny and Bunbeg, County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [25105/02]

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_457">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_783">On 28 November 2002, the company announced the closure of its manufacturing unit at Castlecomer with the loss of 160 jobs. However, the Castlecomer operation will continue to provide work for about 20 employees who will operate the group's accounts, sales and administration centre which handles the distribution of products for both its Asian and European activities. There is a possibility that up to 50 or 60 people could be re-employed in the new year. This cannot be clarified until market demand for the new season is established in January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The future of the plant at Bunbeg remains in question pending the outcome of further negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The company has endured extensive short-time working this year and has concluded that there is not a sufficient volume of business to sustain two plants. Also, increased manufacturing costs are putting the company at a further disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The company specialises in wool/polyester stretch yarns for use in fabrics. However, in recent times retailers have turned increasingly to cheaper products as a means of generating better revenue. The company has tried to develop new products but their efforts have proved insufficient to date, resulting in the closure announcement last Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Every effort is now being made to keep the Donegal plant in business. The managing director met with the workforce on 29 November 2002 and a further meeting is scheduled for 6 December 2002.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_788">I am sorry 160 workers have been laid off in Castlecomer. There has been criticism of the fact that a meeting arranged with the Tánaiste to discuss a viability plan before the announcement was made did not take place. It had been hoped that management, unions and public representatives could have examined the possibility of keeping the firm in operation and maintaining the 160 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Was a viable alternative to closure mentioned in the Tánaiste's discussions with the management of the company? I was disappointed that she made no mention of a task force in her reply to the matter I raised on the Adjournment last week. Will she agree to establish a task force in Castlecomer, where employment is needed? Is there a different form of funding, directly or indirectly, by Údarás na Gaeltachta, in respect of the plant in Bunbeg?</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_790">The meeting did not take place at the time suggested because management had not informed the workers of their plans so it would have been an unreal meeting. It is not the job of a Minister, or indeed a journalist, to tell workers what their future is. Too many workers have heard their fate on radio or television programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">Mr. Brooks came to see me with Mr. Dan Flinter. The company's problem is one of working capital. We are prohibited by law from giving companies assistance with working capital so help was not a possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The situation in Bunbeg is by no means certain. The survival of that plant depends on a number of matters, waiving the rent for three or four years because the company does not own the building; reduction in the cost base through wage reduction and cost savings; closure of the Castlecomer plant; and the agreement of Ulster Bank which is owed approximately €13 million. These requirements would have to be met before we could be satisfied that the plant can stay in operation. The waiving of the rent would be in contravention of EU guidelines so that is probably not a runner.</p>

          <p eId="para_794">Would the Minister agree to the establishment of a task force for Comerama in view of its significant contribution to employment in north Kilkenny and the fact that there is little other employment in the same area? Who owns the factory in Bunbeg? Is it being given rent free? The Minister mentioned that there might be some rent subsidy possibilities in respect of Bunbeg and that there might be some other assistance given through Údarás na Gaeltachta that would not be available to Comerama in Castlecomer. Will she clarify those issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_799">I am aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and that insurance costs in other EU member states are lower than here. However, in some of the other member states, compensation for personal injuries is paid largely through the social security system rather than through private insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">On 25 October 2002, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by me, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">Of course I am concerned about home insurance. My colleague, Deputy Parlon, has arranged to have discussions with insurance companies in respect of this issue. There are issues for the State in relation to remedial action that needs to be taken. Certainly, it would be unthinkable if vulnerable householders in Dublin or elsewhere were not to get insurance cover from the insurance sector. We expect insurance companies to cover them, provided that the State takes every action to make sure that it or its authorities are not negligent in respect of drainage and other issues.</p>

Will she publish or make available comparative data concerning the cover and premia available in all other EU member states?

Will the Minister outline what particular supports her Department gives to prospective or new small companies or individuals that want to provide enterprise in a community but are prohibited from doing so simply because of their inability to obtain affordable insurance? Is there an advisory system, a support system or a mentoring system run by her Department that assists in difficulties of this kind? Has she quantified in any way the impact of unaffordable insurance on the small and medium-sized business sector?</p>

          <p eId="para_820">The Department gave some funding to ISME to carry out research in this area. It published its findings some time ago and the evidence suggests that many jobs are being lost as a result of the high cost of insurance, perhaps in ones and twos and small numbers so one does not always hear about them. There is no doubt that this is making Irish companies uncompetitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">With regard to support, both Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards have packages of support for people who want to start their own businesses. We do not have specific insurance-related support, but the HSA is involved on an ongoing basis with established companies regarding the best practice to ensure that we can minimise the number of accidents that take place, thereby reducing the cost of employer liability insurance in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">With regard to other European countries, I would be delighted to make available and publish any other information I have. The system in many other European countries is different in that compensation is paid through the social security system. That is a fundamental difference and it impacts upon the premium prices. If the State carries the compensation cost, the market for the insurance companies is a lot more lucrative.</p>

      asked the

      the reason for the cuts of 18% in the allocation for Enterprise Ireland grant to industry; the reason for the cut of 84% in the allocation for IDA Ireland grants for building operations; the implications of these cuts for job creation and industrial development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [24853/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_484">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_824">The reduction in Enterprise Ireland's allocation for grants to industry must be viewed in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland's overall capital grant budget. Enterprise Ireland's capital grant budget is made up from three different elements, namely, Exchequer moneys from subhead D on grants to industry; Exchequer moneys from subhead F on grants for R&amp;D and own resource income. In 2002 the estimated total for these three elements stands at €165.075 million. The estimated total amount of expenditure by Enterprise Ireland in 2003 will increase to €168.283 million. The reduction in the Exchequer contribution to Enterprise Ireland's grants to industry is balanced by the increase in grants for R&amp;D in line with Government policy in this area. The shift in focus will be reflected in the 2002 out-turn whereby €6.7 million was moved from Enterprise Ireland's grants to industry to grants for R&amp;D. The €6.7 million was available due to less than expected draw downs in 2002, partly as a result of decreased draw downs by Enterprise Ireland clients of approved employment grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The reduction in Enterprise Ireland's grants to industry for 2003 will result in a reduction of new approvals of grant aid and equity as well as some re-prioritisation of other measures. As can be seen from this year's draw down however, it is expected that the impact on job creation in Enterprise Ireland client companies will be minimal as companies are generally making the business decision not to increase staff numbers in order to better protect themselves in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The cut of 84% in the allocation for IDA Ireland grants for building operations is somewhat misleading as is it made up of two elements, these being the completion of the payments for a specific project for the provision of interconnectivity capacity and a cut to the industrial property budget of €517,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The 2002 provision included non-recurring expenditure in respect of the development of broadband infrastructure, amounting to a total of €15.529 million. The contract for the investment in expanded large bandwidth telecommunications assets foresaw that payments should cease in 2002, obviating the need for further allocation of Oireachtas grants in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"><i>Additional information</i>The grant for the building operations aspect of the budget amounted to €3.517 million in 2002 and will amount to €3 million in 2003. This is a cut of 15% in the Exchequer allocation to the budget. An Exchequer grant is provided on an annual basis for cash-flow purposes, given the uncertainties of the conveyancing process. However, the building operations budget of IDA Ireland is mainly funded from own resources, through the buying and selling of industrial property at market rates. As such, the consequences of the cut of 15% in the allocation for building operations are not significant in view of the fact that most of the needs of building operations are met from the sale of industrial property – own resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">Does the Tánaiste accept that we need to be particularly vigilant now in terms of providing infrastructure not only for job maintenance but job supports in a time of worsening economic fortunes globally? One of the most important measures we can take is to ensure that our broadband infrastructure is adequate. The contract for the roll out of broadband in the six major towns in the south-east was to be signed in January but I understand it is now on hold. Will the Tánaiste intervene to ensure that basic technology which allows for employment to be generated on a regional basis, which is the intent of the spatial strategy, will be fulfilled? That is a critical element. Will she further accept that cuts in programmes like that and in building projects, particularly for vulnerable areas, are a major attraction in getting an employer to come to areas where they are needed?</p>

          <p eId="para_836">No, it is not under that heading. It is from Enterprise Ireland's budget. The number of venture capital funds we have got involved in with the private sector in recent times was a new initiative introduced precisely for the reason mentioned by Deputy Howlin, namely, to make it easier for small companies to access the finance, which is often one of the main obstacles to starting a business. Infrastructure is key. I do not have responsibility for broadband but I share the view expressed. Recently the Government asked Ira Magaziner to help and advise in this area and he has just reported to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure so perhaps some new insights have been provided on the most effective way a small country like Ireland can roll out the necessary broadband infrastructure for the country at large.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">The Tánaiste has responsibility for employment. Will she undertake to talk to her colleague with responsibility for broadband roll out about this matter? Broadband enters this country at two points through County Wexford. It actually ends at the end of Wexford bridge and there is a project to simply roll it out on a loop across the town. A small investment of €2 million is now in jeopardy. It is absolutely daft that potential development in employment would be put at risk for that hap'orth of tar. Will the Tánaiste undertake to talk to her colleague to ensure that the projects for the south eastern towns and the other areas for broadband roll out will go ahead as planned?</p>

I am active in making that happen and I will undertake to discuss the particular needs of Wexford with the Deputy. Obviously everything is subject to budgetary provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">In regard to Deputy Hogan's comments, it would be wrong to assume that grant aid is a crucial factor in job creation. In the mid-1980s we spent a lot of money on grant aid and we were very unsuccessful at generating employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">In fact, of the approximately 100 manufacturing companies that were given grant aid in 1973, none of them exist today. The strategy now is to help sustain companies, not just to help start them. Deputy Howlin made the point that with the current global economic downturn, sustaining existing companies is a crucial part of the current focus because there have been a large number of early warnings. Many companies are under pressure and many employees are taking wage cuts to save their jobs in this economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">I am not familiar with the details of this study or the conclusion that there are high margins between retail and wholesale prices for lamb meat. If market participants feel, however, there are anti-competitive practices obtaining in the market they should make these concerns known to the Competition Authority, the independent body charged with enforcement of the Competition Act, 2002. It will investigate any such complaints. In 2000, the Government established an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry. The group reported that it found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, either in the pattern of cattle prices or in profit levels obtaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">In relation to prices generally, I intend in the near future to introduce new price display regulations that will clarify and reinforce the responsibilities of the retail trade towards consumers. Retailers are currently required to display the selling price, and in certain circumstances the unit price, in a legible manner on or near all items offered for sale to consumers. All products sold by quantity, in the case of meat products by weight, must be labelled to indicate a selling price as well as a unit price, for example, a price per kilogram. The purpose of these regulations is to enable consumers to make informed choices between products and outlets and get maximum value in the purchases they make. The revised regulations in preparation will seek to give additional impetus to the realisation of that objective.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">The day before the general election the Taoiseach distributed a circular throughout the relevant parts of my constituency outlining his and the Government's commitment to the establishment of a major development on the lands at St. Brendan's, Grangegorman. Approximately 70 acres of prime land in the heart of the city was to become the campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology and a smaller portion of land was to be allocated for health board purposes. This commitment was given with the intention of persuading the voters of the Dublin Central constituency to support the Government and vote for the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">In his circular the Taoiseach indicated that the first footprint on the proposed new campus would be in place before the end of 2002. To date, while there have been footprints from trespassers and others, there has been no activity by the Government. Two months ago the Taoiseach organised a launch to indicate his intention to deliver on the commitment. Officials from the health board and the President of the Dublin Institute of Technology jointly presided and a great plan was presented. Since then nothing has happened. No funding has been made available and there appears to have been no planning. Legislation was to have been introduced to enable the envisaged development to proceed but this has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">Everybody is at a loss to know the Government's intention. The Dublin Institute of Technology has been involved in a ten year old campaign to secure a consolidated campus for its faculties. There are three on the north side, at Bolton Street, Cathal Brugha Street and the College of Marketing and Design at Mountjoy Square and three on the south side, at Kevin Street, the College of Music at Chatham Street and the College of Commerce at Aungier Street. These six faculties, based on ten acres of land throughout the city, require consolidation in a single campus. The proposed development at Grangegorman would, therefore, be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">In the Grangegorman area there are also approximately 30 acres of recreational grounds which the college authorities and health board would make available to students and the local community. This is another commitment which was made and which the local community is waiting to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The multidenominational school, Educate Together, has been going from Billy to Jack over the last number of years and it is now accommodated in Henrietta Street. St. Joseph's School for the Blind on the Navan Road was expecting to get a couple of acres as a permanent base for its activities. Dublin City Council had an interest in the development. It was looking for a portion of land for a senior citizens' development. We are talking about 70 acres of land. Half of the land is proposed to be developed by Dublin Institute of Technology, another few acres by the health board and the playing fields and some acreage for Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">We have not heard a word since then. No money was made available in the recent Estimates and nothing appeared in the budget. We do not know what the Government's intention is and whether promises made in the heat of the election are going to be delivered. No hard commitments have been made in terms of funding or a schedule of works. When will Exchequer funding be allocated for the development, when will the development commence and will all the types of development I have outlined be catered for?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_874">I am pleased that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House details of the proposed development of lands at St. Brendan's, Grangegorman. I will outline the background to the proposed development.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">In May 2001, following the Government decision, an interdepartmental committee was established comprising representatives from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Finance and the Taoiseach. Its terms of reference were to examine how the Grangegorman site could best be developed to achieve Government policy priorities in meeting educational and social service needs in a way which takes into account the overall development of Dublin and leverages the strategic location and commercial potential of the site to attract private involvement on a PPP basis. This was to be done having particular regard to: the provision on a staged basis of modern campus facilities needed by Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of Government policy for third level education; the provision in the short term of non-acute units needed by the ERHA on part of the campus but also on other sites in the region, taking account of the investment in kind by the authority; arrangements to afford the local community access to playing fields on the campus; the integration of the proposed campus development with Luas and other relevant public transport provision; and an approach to financing that includes leverage of the site's strategic location and commercial potential in order to lessen the burden on the Exchequer and avoid circular transfer of funds between Votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">In April this year, the Government agreed that a statutory Grangegorman development agency be established to commence work on an integrated urban design and land use framework plan for the Grangegorman site and to manage the development of the site. Preparation of the necessary scheme of legislation by the Department of Education and Science has been initiated and will involve consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">This will pave the way for phase one of the development of a modern new campus at Grangegorman for Dublin Institute of Technology and upgraded facilities for the ERHA to meet the needs of the vulnerable group of patients under the care of the Northern Area Health Board at Grangegorman. These latter facilities will be on the site and at other authority sites in the region.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">Phase one will involve relocating to the new campus some of the Dublin Institute of Technology facilities and office which are at present spread over 39 buildings on 30 different sites in the city. The Grangegorman site is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole and this will be recognised by the Grangegorman development agency which will ensure that its strategic location and potential is unlocked to best meet the Government's objectives in the provision of high quality health and education services, while facilitating access by the local community to sporting facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The Minister for Education and Science hopes to introduce a memorandum and heads of the Bill in relation to the establishment of the Grangegorman development agency in the new year. The development of the project will be considered in the context of available overall resources in the education and health sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Officials from the Department of Education and Science will commence a series of meetings in the near future with the Higher Education Authority and each institute of technology to review the entire set of capital requirements in the third level sector with a view to re-establishing priorities and re-phasing projects in the context of future funding expectation.</p>

        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_520">
          <from>Mr. Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I wish to protest that the Minister did not come to the House to answer the matter directly. I do not wish to cast any aspersions on the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce and I am sure he is very capable in his area, but he does not have a clue about the subject of my question. The Minister should be here to answer what is asked in the House rather than having a prepared script which is read in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I was born and reared beside the River Robe and I spent many happy days fishing there in my youth. The river has come to a sorry pass now. The River Robe drains the south and east Mayo basin and runs into Lough Mask on its western shore.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The western shore shallows of Lough Mask are the main area for wild brown trout angling on the lake. The lake comprises 20,000 acres and has depths of up to 150 feet. Because of its shallow nature the western shore area of the lake is particularly prone to pollution. There is now moderate or slight pollution in 70% of the river. On a recent visit I observed a yellow scum from bank to bank of the river about one inch thick which was waiting to fall to the bed of the river and cause further havoc. Not only is this filth being dumped into Lough Mask, the Robe is also the primary spawning river for the Lough Mask trout and the particularly unique gillaroo trout. Already stocks in the lake are adversely affected and a collapse in the brown trout stock in the river has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">This is a crisis in one of Europe's prime wild trout fisheries. The stakeholders are Mayo County Council, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, Carra Mask Anglers Federation, Clar IRD, the Department of Agriculture and Food, Teagasc, the Office of Public Works, Farm Development Services, the Irish Farmers Association, the Forestry Service, Dúchas, the Central Fisheries Board, the EPA, TAFI and Ballinrobe anglers. The Minister launched a catchment management group on 25 February 2002. A statement issued by the Department stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Speaking over the weekend at the launch of the River Robe Catchment Management Group in Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo, Minister Frank Fahey stated that "pollution is the biggest threat to our salmon, trout and coarse fish resource and the state of fish stocks is the first barometer of water quality in our rivers and lakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">According to Fahey, the state of the Robe River in Co. Mayo is "frankly depressing". A recent survey carried out by the Western Regional Fisheries Board found that nearly 70% of the river as surveyed is now classified as slightly or moderately polluted.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Increases in algal growth as a result of enrichment have occurred in the river and in recent years this has been coupled with a deterioration in the diversity of insect and other forms of animal life. These problems have also been coupled with a collapse in the wild brown trout stock in the river and an associated decline in Lough Mask. He said "it is imperative that we move now to put in place collective action to turn this unacceptable situation around".</p>
          <p eId="para_890">On that day he sanctioned a €100,000 start up grant for the group. I will quote from his statement in case there is any doubt:</p>
          <p eId="para_891">This year there is €1 million available for projects to be delivered by local clubs and associations acting in co-operation with the fisheries boards. The Minister said that in relation to the Robe River Catchment, "I have sanctioned a €100,000 start up grant", adding that "I am requesting the Western Board, together with the local stakeholders, to complete the planning work necessary to support an application for further NDP funding as soon as possible".</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The statement went on to read:</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Concluding his remarks, Minister Fahey said "it is important to recognise that we are committed to the recovery of the catchment over the long-term and that there is important work to be done to build trust among all the stakeholders and to foster a new ethos of environmental awareness in the catchment area".</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Not one cent of this money has been paid to the group and it has now been informed that no money is available and that there never was. The question must be asked, and I want an answer, was this another pre-election false promise, a gimmick to deceive the group and buy votes? What happened to the money the Minister officially sanctioned that day at a public meeting? He issued a public statement to support what he said. Do not tell me the western board applied for €10,000 and it is now on its way. That allocation has nothing to do with the start up grant for the Robe catchment group but is for other ongoing work on the river. It is completely unrelated to the €100,000 grant which was sanctioned but which disappeared after the election. It was most timely from that point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I call on the Minister's successor to honour the ministerial sanction of funds. The group cannot operate without them. Lough Mask and the River Robe cannot survive without the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Pollution is a serious problem. Cattle numbers in the catchment area have increased by a factor of 25 since 1975. Septic tanks are also a problem as are silage pits and the spreading of phosphates and nitrates on the land. There is not a town sewerage problem as that has been resolved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in all the towns in the catchment area. For future generations, present economic considerations and the sustainability of the area, the promise made to these 14 groups which came together must be kept.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_521">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_897">The concept of fisheries management on a catchment management has been operational since 1997 when it was launched by former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, in a bid to improve the water quality of rivers and lakes. The aim was to ensure that the resources of the fisheries service and all relevant agencies and interests are deployed and mobilised to best effect to prevent pollution and to develop rivers and lakes to their full potential in the interests of all who use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The initial approach involved six pilot river basin projects strategically located around the country. These included: the Vartry catchment, County Wicklow; the Barrow catchment; the Mulkear catchment; the Killarney catchment, River Luane; the south Donegal catchment – Drouse-Lough Melvin-Pettigo; and the Moy. The catchment management approach involves and empowers anglers, environmentalists, farmers, tourism and community groups in securing the potential of the fisheries resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Under this approach the main objectives in a catchment management strategy for a particular water basin should be to prevent and abate pollution of waters, protect and where necessary improve the ecology of the waters, and to provide a framework for water quality management on the basis of which the development of the catchment can proceed in a balanced and sustainable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Through the regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute funding of €600,000 has been provided this year by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for catchment management projects around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">In regard to the River Robe catchment management initiative, a survey carried out by the Western Regional Fisheries Board found that nearly 70%, as Deputy Stagg stated, of the River Robe was slightly or moderately polluted. I am advised that increases in algal growth as a result of enrichment have occurred in the river and in recent years this has been coupled with deterioration in the diversity of insect and other forms of animal life. These problems have also been coupled with a collapse in the wild brown trout stock in the river and an associated decline in Lough Mask.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">To address this issue, the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Fahey, asked the Western Regional Fisheries Board to convene all the relevant parties to agree locally based strategies for tackling the problems of the Robe catchment.</p>

          <p eId="para_910">The amount of funding secured will depend on the evaluation and assessment of projects put forward compared to other competing projects and the general availability of resources under the measures for 2003 and subsequent years. I will bring the comment Deputy Stagg made to the attention of the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">The Companies Report is an annual report on matters relating to the Companies Acts presented to the Oireachtas under section 392 of the Companies Act 1963. As the report covers a wide range of matters and includes a very substantial amount of information, it is difficult to make anything other than a very general statement. If the Deputy has a particular concern, I would be glad to answer a more specific question at a future date.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Companies Report 2001 highlighted a number of significant developments in the company law area during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 was enacted. This was a landmark development in the Government's efforts to combat corporate crime and malpractice. One of the main initiatives covered in the Act was the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The effectiveness of the Government's recent efforts to improve compliance with company law was reflected in the fact that 85% of companies filed their annual return in the CRO compared to only 36% in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">In December, 2001, the Government approved the draft scheme of the Company Law (Audit and Accountancy) (Amendment) Bill, the main purpose of which is to establish the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IASSA) and the transfer to IASSA of the Minister's current role in the regulation of auditors under the Companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">In October, 2001, the regulation to establish a European Company Statute was finally adopted by the EU Council of Ministers. In the same month, the Company Law Review Group was established on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">On 26 July 2002, the Government approved the drafting of the general scheme of a Companies Bill to replace the existing companies code. The new Bill will replace 40 years of companies' legislation. The objective is to bring the general scheme of the Bill to Government for approval early in 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_41">The guiding principles behind the reform are that company law should be effective, intelligible to directors and shareholders, and that the law should reflect how business is transacted. Flowing from this, the principle innovation at the heart of the reform is to replace the public company or plc by the most common type of company, the private company limited by shares, as the standard type of company upon which company law is based.</summary>

          <p eId="para_922">The issue of job creation through the attraction of foreign direct investment is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland, for which it is a day to day operational issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Even at the beginning of 2001, it was clear that the year would be very different to the previous ones, in terms of foreign direct investment markets, including IDA Ireland's work in this area. As the Deputy is aware, global circumstances, particularly in the dotcom and information technology, IT, sectors, had changed investor mood considerably. International business confidence ebbed as 2001 progressed and the awful events of September 11 in the US added to concerns. This exceptional set of circumstances resulted in one of the toughest years in a long time for FDI globally, including IDA Ireland. Overall, as quoted in the World Investment Report 2002: Transnational Corporations and Export Competitiveness, published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the value of non-IFSC foreign direct investment inflows into Ireland in 2001 measured €8.2 billion, down from €11.4 billion in 2000. A decrease of 28% in the same period the decline in worldwide FDI flows was more than 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The significant global economic slowdown, especially in IT, impacted on the agency's results for 2001 and it ended the year with a small net loss of 2.8% in IDA assisted jobs in overseas companies – the first such loss in fifteen years – despite the positive performance in other sectors. This was acknowledged in the agency's annual report and accounts for 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">In absolute terms the number of jobs created in 2001 was still very high at 13,514, higher than every year prior to 1997. The period from 1992 to 2001 inclusive saw increases of almost 44% in the number of foreign direct investment companies operating in Ireland, and more than 75% in permanent employment in these companies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_42">Ireland's recent economic success has changed its profile as a location for investment. The IDA is now competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing which we so successfully won over the past four decades, because we were a largely low cost location. Basic operative skills are now available at lower cost throughout the developing world. Improving communications facilitate businesses to locate parts of their value chains in distant locations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_43">The IDA needs to continue with its existing priority work; first, with current clients to move them up the value chain; second, to achieve better regional balance in new investments; and third, to influence improvements in infrastructure and skills. The objective must be to place Ireland at the leading edge of the global economy in some specific competencies or industry niches.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_44">I am confident the measures outlined which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development will bring positive results to the country. Along with the industrial development agencies, I will continue to promote Ireland with international firms for suitable industrial development projects.</summary>

Overall, approximately 800 community employment places are currently providing labour market services to persons recovering from drug misuse. I have no immediate plans to increase the number of places reserved for the drugs task force as the current allocation of places has not been filled.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">The Estimate for enterprise development in 2003 has been structured specifically to encourage growth in the economy while at the same recognising the overall imperative of reducing the growth in public expenditure. While we must acknowledge the changed economic circumstances in which we are currently operating, it is equally vital that we protect our economic competitiveness and retain the capacity to generate employment in key sectors. The estimate achieves that balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The reduction in Enterprise Ireland's allocation under subhead D2, grants to industry, must be viewed in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland's overall capital grant budget, which will increase from €165.075 million in 2002 to €168.283 million in 2003. Enterprise Ireland's capital grants budget is made up from three different elements, namely; Exchequer moneys from subhead D2 on grants to industry; Exchequer moneys from subhead F1 on grants for research and development and own resource income. The amount allocated to grants to industry has decreased and will result in a reduction of new approvals of grant aid and equity as well as some re-prioritisation of other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">However, in 2002, the estimated total for these three elements stands at €165.075 million. The estimated total amount of expenditure by Enterprise Ireland in 2003 will increase to €168.283 million. The reduction in the Exchequer contribution to the agency's D2 subhead is balanced by the increase in the F1 subhead, which is aimed at increasing support for research and development in industry, in line with Government policy in this area. The new shift in focus will also be reflected in the 2002 outturn whereby €6.7 million was moved from D2 – grants to industry  –  to F1  –  support for research and development. The vast majority of Enterprise Ireland's activities are focused on developing indigenous industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">While the proposed cuts in the Exchequer contribution to Shannon Development's budget are unfortunate, the company's view is that with careful management and targeting capability programmes for indigenous industry clients, the direct impact of the cuts on the company's Irish enterprise client portfolio can be minimised. Shannon Development also has overall responsibility for the promotion and development of the Shannon Free Zone, which is largely made up of multi-national companies. While the proposed cuts in grant expenditure will require careful management of the grant budget in the course of the year, it is not expected that the cuts will impact negatively on the new investment promotion effort.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_45">The Estimate for County Enterprise Development (the City and County Enterprise Boards) for 2003 is €31.015 million. The figure for the current year is €35.805 million. I am satisfied that, while it will be necessary for the boards to base their plans and priorities for the year on a reduced overall allocation, they will be able to continue to provide a comprehensive range of services in supporting micro-enterprises at a local level under the Micro-enterprise Measure of the Regional Operational Programmes, 2000-2006.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">Despite the reductions being imposed on the agencies, close examination of the individual elements of those reductions shows that the agencies can continue to fulfil their mandates successfully in 2003, albeit with a need for a re-prioritisation of tasks and measures. In light of what I have said, I am confident the Deputy will agree that indigenous development strategies remain a priority of the Government's job creation strategy.</summary>

          <p eId="para_938">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment (CE), participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">I consider the reduction of the order of 5,000 in the participation rate on CE in 2003 to be appropriate in the context of the current tight budgetary position, and the continuing low level of long-term unemployment, currently in the region of 21,800 persons or 1.2% of the labour force. Persons on the Live Register are a key target group of the programme in addition to lone parents, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_47">The Government is very much aware of the important contribution CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the Job Initiative programme, which will include an assessment of the role of the programmes in regard to provision of community services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.</summary>

While we must acknowledge the changed economic circumstances in which we are currently operating, it is equally vital that we protect our economic competitiveness and retain the capacity to generate employment in key sectors. The Estimate achieves that balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The cut of €16.046 million in the allocation for IDA Ireland – grants for building operations is somewhat misleading as is it made up of two elements, these being the completion of the payments for a specific project for the provision of interconnectivity capacity and a cut to the industrial property budget of €517,000. The 2002 provision included non-recurring expenditure in respect of the development of broadband infrastructure, amounting to a total of €15.529 million. The contract for the investment in expanded large bandwidth telecommunications assets foresaw that payments should cease in 2002, obviating the need for further allocation of Oireachtas grants in 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_49">The grant for the building operations aspect of the budget amounted to €3.517 million in 2002 and will amount to €3 million in 2003. This is a cut of 15% in the Exchequer allocation to the budget. An Exchequer grant is provided on an annual basis for cash-flow purposes, given the uncertainties of the conveyancing process. However, the building operations budget of IDA Ireland is mainly funded from own resources, through the buying and selling of industrial property at market rates. As such, the consequences of the cut of 15% in the allocation for building operations are not significant in view of the fact that most of the needs of building operations are met from the sale of industrial property i.e. own resources.</summary>

          <p eId="para_945">However, the Department is well advanced in its implementation of the Management Information Framework. This project, which is part of the current modernisation programme across the Civil Service, will result in the establishment of a full accrual based internal management accounting system that will strengthen the Department's capacity for evidence-based decision-making and enable managers to make more efficient, effective and economic use of the resources at their disposal. It is envisaged that the service-wide process will be completed by 2005. Many Departments, including mine, will have completed their individual projects well in advance of that date.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">I welcome the annual competitiveness report 2002, and associated competitiveness challenge document which was recently submitted to the Taoiseach and myself. The main report provides a statistical analysis of Ireland's competitive performance from an international perspective. The report establishes that Ireland has improved its ranking in 24 indicators, disimproved in 29 and remained constant in a further 14. The report confirms many of Ireland's strengths while the challenge document highlights the many challenges we face and the difficult choices which we have to make as we face an uncertain economic environment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">The National Competitiveness Council believes that both the domestic Irish economy and the global economy face difficult times ahead. Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">Recent price and cost developments are highlighted in the annual competitiveness report and it is vital that these are factored into the current social partner discussions. The council also highlights the matter of escalating insurance costs as well as advocating policy measures to increase competition across the services sector to lower costs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">Tackling the insurance issue is my number one priority. Deputies will be aware that I have recently introduced a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the insurance market. On services, we have strengthened the powers of the Competition Authority and fully support its current focus on the level of competition in the non-traded sector. We are also committed to a vigorous programme of regulatory reform to remove unwarranted constraints on competition.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">Apart from those specific issues, the Government is determined that the conditions for enterprise operating in Ireland should be as favourable as possible. This encompasses the costs that business face, the skills level in the population, the physical infrastructure, the regulatory environment and other factors. These reports and the comprehensive list of policy actions designed to enhance Ireland's competitive position will be to the forefront in our policy formulation.</summary>

The purpose of this grant is to enhance the capacity of the association to act as a consumer watchdog and advisory body.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The CAI has a central role in developing a much stronger consumer lobby. Consumers in Ireland are not at all as organised as in other member states. As a consequence they do not have the same impact as other interest groups in informing the policy process. When I addressed the members of the CAI at their AGM last month I told them I want this situation to change. I would like to see the CAI strengthened and expended and a far greater level of co-operation with other consumer organisations. The development of effective policies requires the input and critical analysis of all those who can articulate the views and concerns of consumers. The CAI has been advised that the issue and level of future Exchequer funding will be addressed on receipt from the organisation of a three year strategic plan for their future development.</p>

          <p eId="para_957">The various views put forward recently are not in conflict with setting up the PIAB. Those views have in essence focused on the need to reform the court system and court procedures. I would have no problem in accepting that such reforms are needed – the key reforms advocated have already been recommended in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB. I would see the establishment of the PIAB and the introduction of court reforms not as alternative approaches but, rather, as going hand-in-hand and being mutually re-enforcing.</p>

      [24892/02]

          <p eId="para_993">The development agencies – Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the IDA – have adopted a co-ordinated approach in response to the closure of the major IFI plants in both Cork and Arklow, and the approach is directed at assisting all employees affected by the closure. These supportive efforts have been agreed with the management of IFI who are facilitating the process at both plants. The co-ordinated approach has two objectives; to enhance and facilitate the future employment prospects of the IFI workforce and to identify and support any individual who wishes to start his or her own business.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_61">With regard to the first objective, the process being undertaken involves registering the occupation and assessing the skill level of all ex – IFI employees. In conjunction with this, the job prospects and skill requirements in Cork are being assessed and Enterprise Ireland are encouraging local companies to consider IFI employees for job opportunities. Guidance interviews are being provided by FÁS for all ex-IFI employees. FÁS is also providing retraining courses to facilitate future job prospects of IFI employees, with course content devised to match existing and projected local requirements and job vacancies are continuously being notified by FÁS to the IFI human resources manager in Cork.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">With regard to the second objective, presentations have been made in both Cork and Arklow by Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Board executives on starting your own business. These courses detail the range of supports available from EI and the CEBs. In addition, follow up one to one interviews have been offered to employees interested in starting their own businesses.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">With regard to Cork specifically in early November Enterprise Ireland wrote to its client companies in the areas of east Cork and Cork city advising them of the pool of labour that had become available from the IFI closure. The letter outlined the range of skills involved and a contact point.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">For its part, the IDA south-west office is continuing its focus of attracting new business to regional locations such as Macroom, West Cork Technology Park, Clonakilty and Charleville and to continue to promote the IDA site at Ringaskiddy. East Cork is promoted by the IDA as a unit, comprising Cobh, Youghal, Midleton, Carrigtwohill and Little Island. There has been steady development in Carrigtwohill through new investment and through the expansion of existing industries there. Overall, ten new IDA projects in Cork have been announced in 2002 which will create some 1,120 jobs. A significant proportion of these jobs will be in the international traded services sector.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_65">Sixteen investigations into company law related matters have been initiated by me since I came into office in my previous term as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The High Court Inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday 10 June 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">The National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited section 8 inquiries are continuing. A further interim report was presented to the High Court on 24 July 2002. It is anticipated the final report will be submitted to the High Court in first half of 2003. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court. The High Court ordered the publication of the Ansbacher report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Five of these have been concluded. Of the five investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and has been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. My Department is considering whether this report should be referred to other authorities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">Four investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of two of these four investigations are at a very advanced stage of completion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June 2002. The High Court ruled on certain constitutional issues which had been referred back to the High Court by the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to €9.6 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this €9.6 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 – National Irish Bank €4.8 million, and Ansbacher €3.5 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. In respect of the Ansbacher investigation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented a motion to the High Court in July 2002 seeking to have Ansbacher and seven other companies dealt with in the Inspectors' report made liable for the costs of the investigation. Consideration of this motion is ongoing before the High Court.</summary>

          <p eId="para_998">The Labour Inspectorate is actively pursuing this case, at present. Inspectors have interviewed the employer and examined records in accordance with the appropriate employment legislation. The inspectorate is also seeking statements from several persons concerned and when these matters have been finalised a decision will be made as to the appropriate next steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The High Court award in this case arose from a civil action by way of a plenary summons. In such civil cases solicitors for the plaintiff may execute the order of the High Court by way of sending in the sheriff. Alternatively, the resulting award may be pursued by registering the judgment as a mortgage against the property of the company and later enforce that by way of separate proceedings in the High Court. The judgment is enforced under Order 42 of the Superior Courts.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_75">In the event of any company being declared insolvent in accordance with the requirements of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984-2001 which are administered by my Department, these Acts provide for the payment of certain wage-related entitlements, subject to certain limits and conditions, including time limits. These debts include arrears of wages-salaries, sick pay, holiday pay, minimum notice, etc. They are subject to a maximum of eight weeks and the statutory ceiling of €507.90 per week and would have to have arisen in the 18 months prior to that company being formally declared insolvent.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">In the case of the company in question my Department has no record of it having been formally declared insolvent and therefore, at this stage, the former employees would not qualify for payment under the insolvency payments scheme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1001">The Interdepartmental-Agency Review Group on Public Safety examined the State's approach to public safety and the adequacy of the existing approach. The group also sought to identify deficiencies in this approach and to develop a co-ordinated approach to the subject. Consultations with Departments and public bodies were undertaken and more than 50 submissions were received from interested parties. These submissions primarily dealt with road safety, licensing of events, the regulation of the electrical industry and building controls. The group also carried out research as to how public safety is addressed in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I am concerned about the necessity for the establishment of an agency to deal specifically with public safety regulation. The issues concerning the regulation of public safety are already being dealt with by a number of Departments and public bodies. It may well, therefore, be a matter for some form of a more co-ordinated approach to the issues involved rather than setting up a brand new agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">The current level of job losses flow, not from any inherent fundamental weakness in the economy, but from the continuing impact here of a combination of circumstances, especially the downturn, over the past two years or so, in the international economic environment, and the effect of the events of 11 September on global trade and investment flows.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">While the international economic outlook remains uncertain, some pick-up can be anticipated in 2003 which should lead to a modest acceleration in Irish economic growth in 2003. The Government continues to address the costs and other factors which impact on our competitiveness, so that we will be in a position to reap the benefits of the forecast global economic recovery, when it happens.

          <p eId="para_1014">I can only repeat what I said to an identical question on 5 November. Retailers are required to display the selling price and in certain circumstances the unit price in a legible manner on or near all items offered for sale to consumers. New regulations are also being drafted that will clarify the obligations of retailers and other traders in this area. I do not believe that it would facilitate consumers in comparing prices between different retail outlets and different product brands and sizes to require that excessive amounts of information be included on a label on each product.</p>

      the implications for industrial development and job creation of the recent figures showing that Ireland suffered the sharpest drop in industrial production during September 2002 of all Eurozone countries; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [24882/02]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1016">According to the latest statistics from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the volume of industrial production for manufacturing industries in September 2002 was 13.2% higher than in September 2001. The seasonally-adjusted volume of industrial production was down by 6.3% for the three month period July to September 2002, when compared with the previous three-month period. This relates predominantly to a fall in the production of basic chemicals over the summer months, possibly relating to a number of company closures. Other sectors, such as food and beverages, clothing and textiles and electrical machinery, including semiconductors, have also suffered small declines in output over the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The decline in industrial output has also been accompanied by a small decline in industrial employment. Industrial employment was 258,700 in June 2002, the latest data available, a decrease of 10,300 from June 2001. Despite the employment decline in industry, unemployment, estimated at just 4.3% of the labour force in October 2002, remains low.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The decline in industrial production in the July-September period is of concern, and is regarded as relating primarily to two factors, the slowdown in global demand for manufactured goods, and fast growth in costs for Irish manufacturing industry. Over the past 18 months, the global economy has undergone a marked slowdown, and industrial production throughout Europe and the USA has slowed over the same period. According to data from EUROSTAT, the volume of industrial production, seasonally adjusted, in the eurozone declined by 1% in the year to the second quarter of 2002 – the latest data available. The slowdown is not just an Irish phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">Given the current global economic climate, the Government and the development agencies are concerned at the impact of fast growth in wage and non-wage costs on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of investment in manufacturing industry. Nominal wage costs in Ireland are rising at around three times the EU average. While, in the past, gains in labour productivity justified significant growth in incomes and wages, recent falls in productivity growth indicate that wage inflation will have to ease if low unemployment and competitiveness are to be sustained, both for manufacturing and other industries. Growth in non-wage costs, such as office rental, electricity, insurance and telecommunications also needs to be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_79">The development agencies, IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, continue to promote investment by both multinational and Irish-owned companies in manufacturing industry, particularly in high value-added activities that are suited to the changed cost environment in Ireland and to the aspirations of workers for better jobs and higher wages. My Department continues to work closely with the development agencies in responding to the needs of manufacturing industry and to ensure that Ireland continues to offer a business environment that is conducive to industrial investment, expansion and employment creation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1021">Digital content is emerging as a new economic sector with tremendous enterprise and creative potential for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Based on available data, indications are that the market size for digital content was worth at the very least, $178 billion in 2001, and will be worth, at a minimum, $434 billion by 2006, representing an average annual growth rate of about 29%, and a highly attractive market. The projected growth of the industry between now and 2006 gives Ireland a window of opportunity to carve out a place for itself in new areas of potential strength and expertise and establish a significant presence in a number of high growth digital content sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">For the opportunity to be exploited to the full my Department requested Forfás to develop a co-ordinated strategy for the promotion of the digital content industry. As a first step in that process Forfás in conjunction with the Department, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland commissioned a review of the relative stage of development and potential of the digital content industry in Ireland and internationally. Published in November of this year, the review pinpoints future opportunities and identifies priority actions to achieve a co-ordinated and strategic approach to the promotion of the digital content industry into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">My Department in association with Forfás will establish a digital content steering group, comprising the industrial development agencies and relevant Departments to guide and co-ordinate the development of the sectoral strategies and to progress the implementation of the actions in this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Already, Ireland has strengths in the software, e-learning and wireless sectors both in terms of the enterprise base and specialist research activity in the third level sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_80">Ireland also has a strong creative tradition and a track record of partnership between industry and university in the development of skills and research and development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">The digital hub is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector. The project intends to cluster Irish and international digital media companies, research and development and educational initiatives. MediaLab Europe, the educational and research facility established as a joint venture between the Irish Government and MIT, is already operational in the area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Government funding for the project amounts to €130 million. The bulk of the funding has been allocated to property purchase in the area which is now complete. Refurbishment of property will be undertaken mainly by the private sector using the PPP model.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">Construction of a 3 km high speed, fibre broadband network in the hub at a cost of €2.29 million was completed in September 2002 and a network operations centre is scheduled to be in place by the first quarter of next year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">In addition, Enterprise Ireland is at an advanced stage of development of its major new regional web works initiative. This initiative is being developed in association with the private sector and local authorities. Web works are technology hubs designed to generate a critical mass of high potential start-ups in a region.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1030">Responsibility for the enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 rests with the Labour Inspectorate of my Department. Inspectors carry out both day time and night time work as part of their normal conditions of service. The night time element of their duties is almost exclusively related to the work of the enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. Targeted inspections by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels are a regular feature of the work of the inspectorate. During 2001 some 1062 inspections under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 were undertaken. Of these, 768 were day time inspections while 294 were undertaken at night time. To date some 1,070 inspections have been carried out. Of these, 786 were day time inspections while 284 were night time inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">In addition, the employment rights information unit of my Department concluded a pro-active awareness campaign earlier this year whereby all secondary schools were circulated with information on all aspects of employment law, including details of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.

          <p eId="para_1037">The Estimate for enterprise development in 2003 has been structured specifically to encourage continued growth in the economy while at the same time recognising the overall imperative of reducing the growth in public spending. The fact is that we must acknowledge the changed economic circumstances in which we are currently operating. I am conscious, however, that it is equally vital that we protect our economic competitiveness and retain the capacity to generate employment in key sectors.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Shannon Development has overall legislated responsibility for the promotion and development of the Shannon Free Zone, which is largely made up of multi-national companies. The expenditure cuts relate to the grant moneys available to Shannon Development to support both new greenfield projects and capability/capacity development for the existing portfolio of companies in the Shannon Free Zone. A particular focus for the Shannon Free Zone executive is the promotion of new higher value and knowledge intensive activities in line with my Department's policy. The view taken by the agency is that the proposed cuts in grant expenditure will require careful management of the grant budget in the course of the year but that, with careful management and the targeting of capability programmes mentioned, the direct impact of the cuts on the company's Irish enterprise client portfolio can be minimised. Furthermore Shannon Development does not expect that the cuts will impact negatively on the new investment promotion effort.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">For these reasons, I believe that close examination of the individual elements of those reductions shows that Shannon Development can continue to fulfil its mandate successfully in 2003, albeit with a need for a reprioritisation of tasks and measures.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1039">I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on IDA Ireland the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment in regional locations as opposed to Dublin and its environs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">IDA Ireland markets north Cork as one area, which includes Charleville, Kanturk, Newmarket, Mallow, Millstreet, Fermoy and Mitchelstown. Since its inception, the agency has been marketing the BES building in Charleville through its network of overseas offices and project divisions. As no interest has been expressed in the facility there have been no site visits to date. However, while the agency will continue to actively market the facility to potential clients from a complete range of IDA target sectors in either manufacturing or internationally traded services through its project divisions and overseas offices, it is the client company that makes the final decision on where any project will locate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">In relation to Macroom, IDA Ireland has designated the town as a priority location in the south-west region and it is committed to securing a new project for the town. The agency aims to attract projects from a complete range of IDA Ireland target sectors such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, ICT and international services, and it is actively marketing both the location and the former GSI facility though its project divisions and its network of overseas offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">While Elan had purchased the former GSI facility in April 2002 it is currently on the market again. IDA Ireland works in co-operation with the Elan facilities manager in Macroom when site visits are scheduled. Since the facility has gone on the market, one company viewed the site as part of a national site selection process.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_88">IDA Ireland owns a 4.4 acre site in Macroom, which is available for suitable inward investment or indigenous projects and this is also being actively promoted by the agency. IDA continues to work closely with the existing base of companies by encouraging them to add new functions to their operations such as research and development, marketing and customer support. In this way, companies can continue to develop, grow and add higher quality jobs in their current locations. There are currently 11 IDA Ireland-supported companies employing 2,500 people within a 30 minute commute of Macroom, including two companies in Macroom itself.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1049">The annual Forfás employment survey, which is currently under way, will provide a clear picture as to the employment changes in clients of IDA, Enterprise Ireland, EI, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">With regard to EI, it is anticipated that gains will be more modest than last year and losses greater as companies continue to downsize. The key factors underpinning job losses in EI clients are: the weak international trading environment, the weakening competitiveness of companies and costs pressures on wage bills, packaging costs, insurance premiums and oil prices, all of which continue to undermine competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Notwithstanding this, EI continues to work with new high potential start-up ventures through its specialist regionally based teams to ensure the seedbed of development clients going forward. Furthermore, EI continues to work closely with existing clients on developing exports, increasing innovation and improving competitiveness. EI also assists in the provision of business infrastructure and has a number of initiatives well under way in this area such as Webworks in key locations, IT incubation centres and community enterprise centres. Furthermore, the new seed and venture programme established by Enterprise Ireland is focusing on new regional funds, funds for new technologies, for example, biotechnology as well as continuing to support high growth companies. It is anticipated that these funds will leverage of the order of €200 million of private venture capital in support of SMEs in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">For their part, the city and county enterprise boards will continue to encourage and support the establishment of new micro-enterprises and the expansion of existing ones, particularly in the less developed areas within their boundaries. The boards will give priority to identifying micro-enterprises that have the capability and potential for substantial and sustained growth.

        <summary eId="sum_90">While the current economic downturn has impacted on the level of job creation in many parts of the economy, new foreign direct investment job creation is still happening on a significant scale. IDA is competing strongly at present for a range of valuable investments in the pharmaceuticals, healthcare and international services sector. Meanwhile, major investments are proceeding such as Intel's €2 billion spend on FaB 24 at Leixlip and Wyeth's €1.5 billion biopharma development in Grange Castle.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">It is worth recording that, despite the worst downturn in the history of the ICT sector, the five leading companies in the sector in Ireland – Intel, Dell, IBM, HP and Microsoft – continue to employ between them as many people in Ireland as they ever did. In October 1999, just three years ago, these companies between them employed just over 13,000 people in Ireland. Our current estimate for October 2002 is that they employ just over 16,000 people.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">Furthermore, there is still considerable interest in Ireland among many leading international companies for higher level activities. This interest is spurred by our successes over the past decade and our newer offerings both in skills and the 12.5% rate for all corporate trading profits. Ireland's future success will be dependent on our ability to achieve an environment where research and knowledge, high level skills and expertise, high quality infrastructure and business services, are combined in that flexible and creative way which is almost uniquely Irish. Foreign direct investment will feed into that future operating model and will be essential to its success, but it will be increasingly integrated and interwoven with Irish business which is itself ever more international. The further transformation to being innovation-driven will not be instant, but it will need to progress quickly so that we are recognisably different, yet again, by 2010. In the meantime, we need to continue winning foreign direct investment at higher value levels using some of the advantages and tools that have been so successful for us to date.</summary>

Since its inception, IDA Ireland has been actively marketing the BES building in Listowel through its property division and its network of overseas offices. There have been four site visits by overseas companies to the building, as well as viewings by members of the agency's international services division who have also met the promoters of the building. While these efforts have not yet resulted in the securing of a suitable inward investment project, IDA Ireland is continuing to actively market the BES facility and Listowel to potential clients. However, it is the client who makes the final decision on where any project will locate.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">Figures for 2001 indicate that, unlike other locations in Ireland which would have seen a decrease in employment in IDA Ireland-assisted companies, north Kerry experienced substantial growth of 16% through the agency's existing base of companies.

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1060">I share the Deputy's concern at the increase in the level of job losses in Donegal in recent months. These events are a consequence of the slowdown over the past year or so in the world economy, the most severe in almost 30 years and, as one of the most open economies in Europe and the world, Ireland has been particularly exposed to this downturn. However, I would point out that the live register statistics supplied by the Central Statistics Office for December 1998 for County Donegal were 13,485 and the most recent statistics of October 2002 are 9,355, a reduction of 4,130 in the intervening period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I would also make the point that job creation is a day to day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and one, for which I, as Minister, have no direct involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. The county and city enterprise boards are also actively involved in supporting the creation of employment in micro-enterprises, that is, enterprises employing ten people or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Enterprise Ireland, EI, is proactively adopting a structured approach to driving growth in Donegal and provides preferential funding for companies with detailed export plans expanding or establishing a business in the county and throughout the BMW region. The support of EI's specialist teams in the region, in Dublin and in 30 overseas locations is being used for Donegal companies seeking to grow their businesses in international markets and progress is being made in this regard. EI has approved almost €755,000 to client companies in the county already this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">In 2002 significant progress has been made in the provision of seed and venture capital, additions to space for community enterprise activities and the development of an innovation strategy for Ireland north-west. Ten community enterprise centres, CEC, have been funded in the county to date, the most recent being Erne Enterprise Development Limited who were approved a capital grant of €300,000 and the Donegal Town Community Chamber Limited who received a feasibility grant of €6,500 under the new CEC programme for 2002. The 10,000 square foot Moville CEC, approved in 2001, is due to open in 2003 and the 25,000 square feet Letterkenny CEC approved under the 1999-2000 scheme opened late last year and is almost full.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_97">A number of other companies continue to recruit in the county, including Kirchhoff Ireland in Letterkenny – automotive components, Boston Scientific Interventional Technologies in Letterkenny – medical devices, and Claddagh Resources in Buncrana – executive search company.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">In addition, the Letterkenny Business Park has been completed and plans are well advanced to extend this park, following the acquisition of 90 acres of land. Work has now been completed on the provision of a second 25,000 square foot advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance facility. In addition, planning permission has been sought for a new facility in Ballyshannon and a 20,000 square foot factory in Buncrana. The agency is also continuing to market the factories vacated by Fruit of the Loom at Milford and Buncrana.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">FÁS actively supports the IDA and Enterprise Ireland by providing training and recruitment support to new and expanding companies and in response to the job losses throughout the county in 1999-2001, FÁS Employment Services conducted quality registration interviews with each affected employee. This intervention was additional to the many services that FÁS provides for all unemployed people at the various outreach centres and at the FÁS training centre in Letterkenny and Gweedore.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">Donegal County Enterprise Board has in recent years approved 26 projects with 59 potential new jobs and an additional potential for a further 35 new jobs from one of the projects.

In this regard the labour inspectorate of my Department monitors certain employment conditions of the various categories of all workers in Ireland, including non-EU workers. The inspectorate pursues allegations of worker mistreatment and in the event that evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">Most firms, and in particular most small firms, using e-commerce business techniques can develop quite well over the coming years on the basis of digital subscriber line or DSL broadband technology which uses the existing telecom copper cabling to subscribers. The bandwidth needed by businesses varies. It is not uniform. Where higher data capacities are needed such as by large firms or projects requiring intensive Internet use, high capacity leased lines can normally be provided as required by the telecommunications firms. The current roll-out of DSL will enable many businesses and consumers to upgrade their current narrowband and ISDN connections to broadband. From the industrial strategy and competitiveness viewpoints, the primary challenge at this point is to ensure that Irish firms and investment locations have a broadband option such as DSL.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">In an ideal world, broadband services would be delivered on fully optical networks designed to meet demand and capacity needs well into the future. The advantage in access speed that optical has over broadband using existing copper-wire connections would create efficiency gains and help in attracting investment. While most of our network is already fibre-based and is expected to evolve more fully over the next decade in that direction, we also must remember that the cost of rolling-out any form of broadband is substantial and upgrading from copper obliges the firms in this privatised sector to weigh the business case for doing so, including the digging up of roads or the putting up of masts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Because this Government is determined to ensure that Ireland retains the capacity to attract a high volume of foreign direct investment, the country needs to move progressively into higher value activities as Ireland is no longer a low wage economy. The availability of broadband such as DSL or optical fibre is now of key importance in this regard. The Government has taken a number of measures to address this issue. In March 2001, we announced a regional broadband programme under the 2000-06 national development plan which will deliver fibre optic networks in key centres regionally. This is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities, with 90% funding from the Exchequer. This initiative is aimed at addressing the Government's medium term aim of having broadband speeds of five megabits to the home and substantially higher for business users. Construction on phase one of the initiatives will begin shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">In an earlier round of national development plan funding, Government assisted the development of a new national fibre-backbone owned by the ESB, and the roll-out of DSL services by both Eircom and Esat.</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 78 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">In deciding on the 2003 allocations for labour force development and related areas, difficult choices had to be made given the changed economic environment in which Ireland is operating. However, the Government was conscious of the need to maximise, within the current constraints on public expenditure, investment in measures that have a primary focus on employability. These include the provision of training and employment supports for the disabled and for those experiencing difficulty in entering the labour market.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_102">The allocation for 2003 to FÁS employment programmes, which includes community employment, CE, is set at almost €365 million, as against €413.4 million in 2002. The 2003 allocation will support an average CE participation level of around 22,000 throughout next year with a closing participation rate of about 20,000. This reduction of approximately 5,000 on the end 2002 participation level is in line with Government policy to reduce CE numbers in recognition of the significant reduction of long-term unemployed. Over €30 million is being made available for the social economy programme, an increase from €20.55 million in 2002. This will be sufficient to fund commitments to the projects approved to date but will not allow for the approval of new projects in 2003. The job initiative programme will have an average participation level of around 2,500 throughout the year with an end of year participation level of about 2,200. The end 2002 participation level is expected to be in the order of 2,800.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">FÁS training and integration supports programme is funded by a combination of Exchequer and NTF finance. In 2003 the direct Exchequer contribution of €73,518 million is complemented by a €225.055 million contribution from the national training fund, bringing the overall investment in FÁS training initiatives to €295.573 million. This compares to €301.018 million in 2002 which means that overall investment in this area is being maintained at close to 2002 levels. This will result in some reduction in training places in 2003. FÁS will prioritise, in so far as possible, the training and employment supports for the disabled within their overall allocations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">The board of FÁS, taking account of Government policy guidelines, will decide on the detailed priorities and breakdown of funding between schemes and activities from within these overall allocations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">The allocations in 2002 for FÁS training and integration supports programme and its employment programmes have not been reduced. FÁS estimates that the outturn for the year will be broadly in line with forecasted activity levels.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1092">Employment rights legislation has grown in volume, scope and complexity since the 1970s and that complexity extends also to the mechanisms for inspection, enforcement and the resolution of conflict. Without in any way eroding the protection of workers it is timely to look at the roles and the procedures of such bodies as the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal; the mechanisms to deal with the resolution of conflict where for example workers feel that they are unable to exercise those rights; and the appellate mechanisms which come into play after the rights commissioners or the tribunal have made their recommendations. It is timely, in short, to look at a system of rights and responsibilities which has grown up very often in response to EU initiatives and been grafted on to existing institutions to ensure that the system is clear, coherent and user-friendly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">The position in relation to task forces, including their evaluation, is set out at some length in a reply which I gave to a question tabled by the Deputy on 5 November last. I do not propose to undertake further evaluation of the 19 task forces but the general conclusion, based on the operational experience with the task forces, is that, overall, they provided an effective co-ordinated response to major company closures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">Extensive monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the enterprise development agencies under my aegis – Forfás, IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards – is carried out through a number of channels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The overall framework for the work of the agencies is determined by the Oireachtas and is set out in the Industrial Development Acts and the science and technology legislation. The performance of agencies is measured in relation to performance indicators such as cost per job created, as well as client company performance on matters such as employment, training, research and development, and the level of sales and exports. Performance in these regards is reported in the annual reports of the agencies which are laid before the House. The board of each agency has a crucial role in ensuring effectiveness, efficiency and value for money in relation to the agency's work. Cross-agency co-ordinating mechanisms are in place. Forfás is responsible for policy advice across the spectrum of enterprise, science and technology policy matters, and it also carries out extensive ongoing analysis and evaluation of agency policies and programmes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_106">Individual industrial projects receiving State support are subject to prior cost benefit analysis using an economic model developed and regularly updated, in the light of economic developments, with the help of external economic expertise. In circumstances where project targets are not achieved, State aid is subject to recoupment under the terms of the grant agreement in each case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Budget and policy programme proposals in respect of each agency are subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas, notably by the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and the Public Accounts Committee. Each spending subhead involved, is, of course, subject to annual approval by the House and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who also audits the annual accounts of each agency and who carries out value for money evaluations of programmes, for example a report on the provision and management of industrial property by the agencies was completed in 1998. A value for money examination of local development programmes, which included county enterprise boards in its scope, was carried out by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1999. These reports are presented to the House.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">Delivering Better Government, 1996, envisaged programme reviews as constituting a central element in financial management under the strategic management initiative. To this end, a programme of expenditure reviews is carried out and the performance of the agencies is included in this programme. Reviews were completed in respect of IDA in 1998 and Forfas in 2001. Reviews of aspects of Enterprise Ireland's and IDA's work are to be completed in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">The main programmes of the agencies are included in the Structural Fund operating programmes for the period 2000 to 2006. These programmes are subject to extensive monitoring and analysis by the monitoring committee for each operating programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1106">In April 2002 the Government established a review group, in the context of social partnership, to examine the operation of the redundancy payments scheme to ensure the scheme best meets the requirements of employers and employees. The review group consisted of representatives of the social partners – IBEC, CIF, ICTU – the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The redundancy review group commenced its work in April 2002 and the Government considered the report in October 2002. The report has been published.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Agreement was reached in a wide range of practical areas, which will contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the scheme. To give effect to these efficiency measures the Government has agreed to prepare legislation that will reflect the conclusions of the redundancy review group and other minor changes in redundancy legislation and to proceed with planning a new IT system which will implement the legislative changes proposed by the review group and make the delivery of the redundancy scheme more efficient by maximising the use of e-government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Agreement could not be reached within the group on a range of improvements in the level of benefits payable under the scheme. Therefore, it is expected that any improved benefits will be negotiated within the current round of social partnership discussions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1110">The WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement provides for a review of Article 27.3(<i>b</i>) four years after the agreement entered into force, i.e. review in 1999. This review is under way and is continuing in the WTO TRIPS Council. Paragraph 19 of the Doha Declaration instructs the TRIPS Council to continue the review of Article 27.3(<i>b</i>) and to, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity, the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore, and other relevant new developments raised by members pursuant to Article 71.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">Ireland, along with its EU colleagues, is participating in the review on the basis that it is addressing the manner in which the provision has been implemented and is not an attempt to re-write the scope of the provision. The Irish and EU position is that Article 27.3(<i>b</i>) of TRIPS provides for the necessary flexibility for WTO members' implementation and that UPOV and other similar harmonised plant variety systems provide effective models for implementing Article 27.3(<i>b</i>).</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">In the context of the mandate provided at the fourth WTO Trade Ministerial Conference at Doha, in November 2001, the European Communities and its member states have recently submitted a concept paper to the TRIPS Council on the review of Article 27.3(<i>b</i>) of the TRIPS Agreement, and the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore. The paper deals with, <i>inter alia</i>, issues such as farmers' right to save, use, exchange and sell farm-saved seeds and sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. The EC paper and similar such papers communicated by other non-EU WTO members were circulated for consideration at a meeting of the TRIPS Council on 25 to 27 November 2002, and are to be again considered at the next meeting of the TRIPS Council in early 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">On the question of the TRIPS Agreement and access to essential drugs, the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health recognises the rights of WTO members to grant compulsory licences and to determine the grounds for granting these licences, in particular when public health is at stake. Paragraph 6 of the declaration instructs the TRIPS Council to find a solution to the problem faced by WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector under the TRIPS Agreement.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_110">The EC, in June 2002, submitted a detailed proposal for a solution to the problem at stake. While the EC and member states remain open to examine and discuss other solutions trading partners may propose, the EC in its communication proposes to add a new paragraph to Article 31 relating to the granting of compulsory licences that would carve out a clearly circumscribed exception to the restriction imposed by Article 31(f) of the TRIPS Agreement, with a view to facilitating the export of pharmaceutical products to, for example, developing countries. The EC proposal and those of other WTO members are currently the subject of detailed consideration and debate at WTO fora in Geneva.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1122">The current position in relation to the transposition of EU directives for which my Department is responsible indicates a total of 42 directives to be implemented, including 12 for which the deadline for implementation, in full or in part, has passed. Details of the directives, including, in so far as it has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives. The website also contains information on directives in respect of which infringement proceedings have been commenced. A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of the Treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of two, and a reasoned opinion in the case of another two, of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed. I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing the provisions of EU directives, in light of the available resources.</p>

I also understand that the workers are co-operating fully with the liquidator. It will obviously take some time for the liquidator to realise the various assets of the company and to pay creditors whatever is due to them out of the available funds. As the Deputy will probably be aware, the shareholders have agreed to provide nearly €24.5 million to fund <i>ex gratia </i>severance payments to the workers. This is separate from statutory redundancy payments which my Department is aiming to issue before Christmas in respect of valid claims received recently. The basis for the distribution of the <i>ex gratia </i>funds will be determined by Mr. Jackson, in his role as the trustee of the trust fund established for this purpose, following consultations with workers representatives. While this process has not yet been completed, interim payments of €5,000 have now been paid to most workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">Even though it is now over a month since the company announced that it was to close, the position in relation to the various pensions funds covering IFI workers remains unclear. This is unavoidable given the complexity of pensions issues generally but it is unfortunate that there still appears to a lot of incomplete and sometimes conflicting information circulating at present in relation to the position of each of the various schemes involved. Nevertheless, it is understood that the funds do face potential difficulties, which, in the case of Belfast, seem to be particularly serious. For a number of reasons, such as the different regulatory environment, the position of the schemes covering workers at the other locations may be somewhat better.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_113">However, the problems seem to stem mainly from the impact of adverse stock market movements on the pensions funds investments which are managed by boards of trustees acting independently of the company. IFI has been meeting its obligations to the various schemes on an ongoing basis. The estimated statement of affairs presented by the IFI board at the creditors' meeting showed that the company owes the pensions schemes just £178,000, which should be paid in full in due course because this debt ranks as a preferential creditor in the liquidation. I am not aware of any obligations on my part or on the part of ICL, the other shareholder in IFI, in relation to the pensions funds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_114">It is clear that the uncertainty surrounding the state of the various schemes is giving rise to serious concerns on the part of employees, concerns which may or may not be well founded. Accordingly, it is critical that the trustees of each scheme establish the full facts as quickly as is feasible and consider the full range of options available to them to mitigate the impact on members or to minimise any shortfalls. In this regard the shareholders have, in the interests of establishing clarity, advised the trustees of each of the funds involved that they would like to be briefed on the trustees' present assessment of the position and their plans in relation to the future. I expect that initial briefings will raise place within the next few weeks. Unfortunately it seems likely that it will take some time for the various issues involved to be clarified fully.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1136">My Department and its agencies are continuously monitoring the position of firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors, to identify both opportunities and threats to employment. There is no evidence available to suggest any increasing tendency for firms to relocate to lower wage economies. The reasons for such relocation are many, varied and complex, and on balance Ireland continues to benefit from such movement due to the underlying strength of our economy despite the recent world downturn. We cannot be competitive in all types of industrial activity, and we continue to seek to secure worthwhile employment for our people in areas where Ireland has a competitive advantage.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The quality and sustainability of the jobs we create is a particular focus for the future. In order to maximise the potential of our existing base of overseas companies, and to minimise job losses, IDA Ireland is encouraging them to add strategic functions including research and development, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics, and shared services.

          <p eId="para_1138">Irish export performance over the past decade has been outstanding. Total exports in 2001 were more than five times the 1990 total. In that period, exports to all of our main markets increased very substantially, as did Ireland's share of global trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">2002 has been a difficult year for exporters. While Irish export growth for the first eight months amounted to 3%, the WTO estimates that the value of global trade in the first six months of this year fell by 4% over the same period last year, indicating that Irish exports are continuing to perform ahead of the global average.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Ireland's largest markets have been the European Union, North America and Asia; the countries of central and eastern Europe – soon to be EU members – have also become increasingly important. I expect that these will continue to be our largest trading partners and that our market share in these markets will continue to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Enterprise Ireland is assisting indigenous exporters in our key markets by increasing its market-based activities – overseas trade missions, participation in trade shows, bringing buyers to Ireland and undertaking pre-export programmes with young companies – and I expect that these efforts will be reflected in export outturns in 2003 and beyond.</p>

          <p eId="para_1144">The issue of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland, for which it is a day to day operational issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The significant global economic slowdown currently being experienced, especially in IT, impacted on the agency's results for 2001 and it ended the year with a small net loss of 2.8% in IDA assisted jobs in overseas companies – the first such loss in 15 years – despite the positive performance in other sectors. This was acknowledged in the agency's annual report and accounts for 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">In absolute terms, however, the number of jobs created in 2001 was still very high at 13,514, higher than every year prior to 1997. Indeed, the period from 1992 to 2001 inclusive saw increases of almost 44% in the number of foreign direct investment companies operating in Ireland, and over 75% in permanent employment in these companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world and certainly one of the highest in Europe. Ireland has for a long time received a far higher proportion of FDI inflows into the EU than our 1% of the population would suggest. In 2000, Ireland got 10% for instance, a large proportion of it from the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Ireland's recent economic success has changed its profile as a location for investment. IDA is now competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing which we so successfully won over the past four decades, because we were a largely low cost location. Basic operative skills are now available at lower cost throughout the developing world. Improving communications facilitate businesses to locate parts of their value chains in distant locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">Ireland's future success will be dependent on our ability to achieve an environment where research and knowledge, high level skills and expertise, high quality infrastructure and business services, are combined in that flexible and creative way which is almost uniquely Irish. Foreign direct investment will feed into that future operating model and will be essential to its success, but it will be increasingly integrated and interwoven with Irish business which is itself ever more international. The further transformation to being innovation driven, will not be instant, but it will need to progress quickly so that we are recognisably different, yet again, by 2010. In the meantime, we need to continue winning foreign direct investment at higher value levels using some of the advantages and tools that have been so successful for us to date.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_118">Despite the worst downturn in the history of the ICT sectors, the five leading companies in the sector in Ireland – Intel, Dell, IBM, HP and Microsoft – continue to employ between them as many people as they ever did. There is still considerable interest in Ireland among many leading international companies for higher level activities. This interest is spurred by our successes over the past decade and our newer offerings, both in skills and the 12.5% rate for all corporate trading profits.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">IDA is competing strongly at present for a range of valuable investments in the pharmaceuticals, healthcare and international services sectors. Meanwhile, major investments are proceeding such as Intel's €2 billion spend on Fab 24 in Leixlip and Wyeth's €1.5 billion Biopharma development in Grange Castle.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">I am confident that the measures outlined above which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to enterprise development, will bring further positive results to the country. I will continue, along with the industrial development agencies, to promote Ireland with international firms for suitable industrial development projects.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_122">The 2001 employment survey showed that total permanent full-time employment in companies under the remit of the industrial development agencies amounted to 315,500 in 2001, a decline of 3,500 over the 2000 figure. While 30,000 jobs were created in 2001, these gains were offset by job losses of 33,500 during the same period. This small decline should however be viewed in the context of an increase in agency employment from 249,000 to 315,500 over the five years up to 2001.

          <p eId="para_1216">Apart from one isolated incident which occurred in the Companies Registration Office (CRO) which is an executive office of my Department, in early November 2000, the security of my Department's computer system has not been breached.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The isolated attempt to hack into one computer system in the CRO failed as it was very quickly detected and remedial action was undertaken to tighten security on this system. It must be recognised that individuals who engage in hacking activities do so on an ongoing basis and are extremely computer literate. Their challenge is to outmanoeuvre technological advances in security systems. This is why all organisations must remain vigilant in this regard at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">My own Department is very conscious of the need to stay abreast of technological advances in the area of computer security. Accordingly, a full security review of all systems was undertaken by expert security consultants during 2002. The results of this review have been considered and additional work as appropriate has been undertaken to ensure, in so far as is possible, that systems are securely protected against attack.</p>

          <p eId="para_1230">For the present, however, and in particular against the background of the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001, and the UK's current high incidence BSE status, it is imperative that we apply EU health rules to animal movements between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction.</p>

          <p eId="para_1248">At the request of Dublin City Council the Office of Public Works has carried out some emergency works since the severe flood. There was a danger of subsidence at three houses off Tolka Road following the failure of a protecting wall and Office of Public Works was requested to place rock, approximately 30 metres in length along the exposed bank of to stop further erosion. To secure this, a concrete wall, similar to the original wall, is now being built along this stretch. Rock has also been placed in the bed of the channel to prevent scouring of the new wall. A number of trees that were obstructing the flow of water in this area were also removed. This work is due to be completed in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">DCC has also undertaken some emergency works by installing temporary flood defences in the Griffith Park area. It has also undertaken a programme of gully cleaning in the areas affected.</p>

The study is being funded by the Office of Public Works and is expected to be completed in May 2003. The consultants have been requested to produce an interim report on what immediate measures can be taken to alleviate flooding in the areas worst affected in the past few weeks. This interim report has just been received and is being considered by officials of the city council and Office of Public Works. I am not in a position to say at this stage what the outcome of this will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_1265">When the Valuation Act, 2001, came into effect on 2 May staff unions in the Valuation Office refused to implement certain provisions of the Act because they were unhappy with the staffing arrangements. Those arrangements included the establishment of a separate agency, the revaluation office, to carry out a systematic revaluation of all rateable property over a period of five to seven years. It was proposed that that agency be staffed by up to 30 newly contracted valuers, with the supervisory and administrative staff being seconded from the Valuation Office. Due to dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements the unions commenced a form of industrial action that entailed not implementing new procedures set out in the Act in relation to communication and consultation with ratepayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">The unions subsequently agreed to resume normal duties to allow negotiations to take place but the union representing professional valuer staff has since re-imposed industrial action. Consequently, the office is unable to deliver a full valuation service to ratepayers or local authorities.

          <p eId="para_1296">The situation in regard to the appointment of educational psychologists to primary schools in Maynooth, Celbridge, Straffan, Ardclough, Rathmore, Sallins, Kilcock, Rathcoffey, Kill and Donadea, County Kildare, remains substantially the same as that outlined in written replies on 17 April and 9 October last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">While my Department has recently made a number of new appointments of psychologists to the national educational psychological service, NEPS, including some who will be based in the eastern region, south-western area, it is unfortunately not possible at present to extend the service to the schools mentioned by the Deputy. The newly appointed psychologists have replaced colleagues who have been promoted or have moved to another region as well as one who, sadly, died earlier this year and one who is on long-term sick leave. However, some schools in County Kildare, which had their service withdrawn last year, due to the staffing difficulties already referred to, have had the service recently re-instated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">It is not possible to be precise as to when particular areas in the county will receive a service until it is clear which psychologists on the panel for NEPS are accepting offers of posts and which are deferring taking up employment until the next school year. A number of schools, some of which were listed by the Deputy, were offered a limited pre-service input last year and it was hoped to extend a full service to them this year. Unfortunately, this has been delayed for the reasons stated earlier. I still hope it will be possible to extend the NEPS service to these schools during the current year but the exact timing will depend upon when the psychologists on the panel actually take up their posts and complete their induction training. In the meantime, the schools referred to in the question may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, details of which may be found on my Department's website.</p>

The programme, funded by the national development plan, has an indicative budget of €16.25 million up to 2006 for funding in renewable energy for heat and power and is expected to support projects in wind energy, biomass, solar, ocean energy, small hydro, ambient heat – heat pumps, geothermal energy and fuel cells. The programme is open to a wide range of proposal types including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD&amp;D.

The report takes the form of a submission to my Department and is one of many such submissions arguing for improvements in a range of services and programmes. In the context of the funding available in 2003, which is designed to maintain existing levels of service, it will not be possible to introduce changes or improvements which require additional funding, unless compensating savings can be identified elsewhere. My Department, with the health boards and other agencies, will give full consideration to all possible options for efficiency gains in 2003 and, in that context, will also consider what, if any, improvements may be introduced.

          <p eId="para_1384">The South Western Area Health Board has operational responsibility for the Ballydowd special care unit. I have been informed by the area health board that this unit is a purpose built secure residential child care facility which opened in autumn 2000 to cater for the needs of young people aged between 11 and 17 years with emotional and behavioural problems. In designing the building models of best practice were examined. Currently, young people in Ballydowd are detained by order of the High Court.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_132">The area health board points out that Ballydowd is for non-offending young people and is not a prison or detention centre. The centre operates on a therapeutic model of care and the building was designed in a way to meet the young people's needs through this model of care. The therapeutic model of care used in Ballydowd is based on experience in other countries of appropriate models of care for units such as Ballydowd. In particular, there was close consultation on the model of good practice developed at St. Mary's Kenure in Glasgow, a 36 bed child care facility with 30 secure beds and a step-down facility with six beds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">The model of care used in Ballydowd is based on a multi-disciplinary assessment leading to access to a continuum of specialist residential units both on campus at Ballydowd and off campus. I am informed by the South Western Area Health Board that the model of care used in Ballydowd continues to evolve in consultation with the social services inspectorate, the special residential services board and experts in other countries and is informed by the experience of the Ballydowd management team and staff in caring for the young people there.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">As Ballydowd was the first facility of its kind in the country, the South Western Area Health Board has learned lessons from working with the young people in this new environment and this continues to inform the model of care in the centre. Extensive staff training has been undertaken at Ballydowd to implement this model of care. Earlier this year the South Western Area Health Board developed a plan around the restructuring and refurbishing of the centre on foot of experience gained in working with the young people. The modifications to the building are well advanced and the board believes they will deal with the issues which have arisen. The board has also made good progress on recruitment with 12 new staff recently employed and in training and it is in the process of offering contracts to 24 other successful applicants. The South Western Area Health Board has indicated the unit will be admitting an additional five young people in the coming weeks in addition to the five currently placed there.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1391">In relation to funding for cancer services in the Mid-Western area, since 1996, €8.25 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board specifically for the development of cancer services, including the development of symptomatic breast disease services. This funding is inclusive of the 2002 allocation of €2 million for the continuing development of oncology-haematology services, funding for new oncology drug treatments and the continuing development of symptomatic breast disease services. An additional sum of €29 million is being provided for cancer services across all health boards in 2003, including dedicated funding for symptomatic breast disease services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">The Mid-Western Health Board formally adopted a report on the development of symptomatic breast disease services for the region in December 2000. The Mid-Western Health Board has agreed to develop its symptomatic services at Limerick Regional Hospital. Referral to the clinic allows rapid access to a consultant surgeon, mammography and rapid processing of results. A weekly multi-disciplinary meeting is attended by all relevant members of the team. My Department has recently issued approval to the Mid-Western Health Board for the appointment of a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery. In addition, two breast care nurses have been appointed to Limerick Regional Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">In relation to the mammography machine at Ennis General Hospital, the Mid-Western Health Board advised my Department in 2001 that the mammography equipment required to be replaced in order to maintain the service at the hospital. The new mammography unit in Ennis General Hospital was officially opened on 1 March 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_1413">The increase was also granted in the context of the continued progress to improve accountability and transparency with regard to Exchequer subvention paid to CIE in respect of non-commercial services. In this context, it was noted in my letter of approval that agreement has been reached with CIE to introduce service level agreements from 1 February next. These agreements will set down for the first time in the history of the companies an arrangement to provide greater transparency in regard to State support for nonommercial services and greater accountability in relation to the quality of the service to be provided by the companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">My Department has been assured by the companies that their fare increases, when taken across the full range of fares, have increased only by an average of 9%. Nevertheless, in a meeting with my Department early this week, the chairman referred to concerns raised in that regard in recent days and indicated that it was his intention to re-examine the new fares over the coming days.</p>

In order to prevent any future such incidents, Iarnród Éireann has developed and issued a new internal standard for the technical approval of third party projects. In regard to construction of this particular bridge, Iarnród Éireann has agreed a revised method statement with the contractor after consulting with the railway inspectorate of my Department. The method statement sets out the means by which the construction can be completed in a safe manner.

          <p eId="para_1421">Iarnród Éireann expects the first phase to cost €145 million approximately and I recently approved the allocation of Exchequer funding for the full amount to allow the commencement of works to provide for eight car DART operation.

          <p eId="para_1422">Iarnród Éireann informs me that because of the scale of the work to be undertaken on the line during the first phase, the need to minimise disruption to service and their own internal resource constraints, the signalling project is planned to commence in 2005 for completion in 2007.</p>

          <p eId="para_1443">Ireland's report to the United Nations on the national plan for women 2002 was submitted to the United Nations in October 2002 to fulfil a commitment to implement the UN Beijing platform for action on the advancement of women. The report, which was published in October 2002, describes in detail Ireland's existing commitments to advancing the status of women in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">My Department also published in October 2002 the report entitled Aspirations of Women collected in the course of the consultation process on the national plan for women 2002: Towards a National Women's Strategy. The Aspirations of Women report records the views of women articulated during the course of a wide ranging consultation process on the draft national plan for women. Both reports will be valuable in informing and influencing Government Departments and agencies into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">A key recommendation made by the consultation process steering committee set up to assist in the preparation of the national plan for women 2002 was the development of a national women's strategy building on the report to the United Nations on the national plan for women 2002 as the framework for Ireland's gender equality agenda from 2003 to 2010. The last such strategy, the Second Commission on the Status of Women, was published in 1993 and, while significant progress has been made since then, economic and social conditions have changed. The proposed strategy would encompass policies across many Government Departments and agencies and would be developed in consultation with the social partners. The Government has requested my Department to consider the recommendations of the steering committee in consultation with other relevant Departments and to bring further proposals, as appropriate, to Government and my Department is now considering how best to advance the development of a national women's strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">In relation to employment equality, my Department has drafted a number of proposals for legislative amendments to improve women's rights in the area of leave entitlements which are currently at various stages of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department, which comprised the social partners and relevant Government Departments and agencies. The group's recommendation to increase the periods of maternity and additional maternity leave was implemented very shortly after the publication of its report in February 2001. The increases were announced in budget 2001 and implemented with effect from March 2001. Identical increases were simultaneously applied to the adoptive leave entitlement.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_140">In December 2000, the Government approved the implementation of the other recommendations of the working group by amendment of the existing legislation through statutory instrument or primary legislation, as appropriate. At that time, the Government also decided to amend the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, to reflect the proposed changes to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, where appropriate. On 17 July 2002, Government approval was obtained for the drafting of a Bill to give effect to the remaining recommendations of the working group. The Bill in relation to the amendment of the Maternity Leave Act, 1994, is currently with the parliamentary draftsman. It is expected that the Bill will be published early next year and enacted as soon as possible afterwards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">Legislative proposals to apply the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation to the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, where appropriate, are currently being formulated in the Department with a view to bringing them to Government in the coming weeks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">In accordance with a commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and section 28 of the Parental Leave Act itself, my Department conducted a review of the operation of the Act in consultation with the social partners in 2001. A working group, chaired by my Department, comprising the social partners, relevant Government Departments and the Equality Authority concluded a review of the Act on 29 November 2001 and the report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, was published on 29 April 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">The recommendations of the working group are being examined in detail by my Department at present with a view to bringing forward concrete proposals to Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">My Department has introduced major pieces of rights-based legislation in the last five years. These include the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which replaced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds – gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act is comprehensive and deals with all areas relevant to employment including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training. The Act is currently being examined in my Department to identify the amendments necessary to the Act in order to give effect to Directive 2002/73/EC (Gender Equal Treatment). The directive must be implemented by October 2005. It is proposed, however, to implement the directive during 2003 along with Directives 2000/43/EC (Race) and 2000/78/EC (Framework Employment).</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">The Equal Status Act, 2000, gives protection against discrimination in non-workplace areas and thus complements the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The Act prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the same nine grounds as the Employment Equality Act, 1998. It deals with discrimination outside the employment context, including education, provision of goods, services and accommodation, disposal of property and private registered clubs. The Act covers all goods and services which are available to the public, whether on payment or not and irrespective of whether provided by the public sector or private sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">My Department is responsible for an equality for women measure under the national development plan which is funding initiatives under the following strands: upskilling and retraining of women employees; encouraging entrepreneurship and career development among women; innovative projects for disadvantaged women and women over 50 years of age; support women in decision making; gender proofing of personnel practices; employer family friendly projects and sharing of family responsibilities; a research and information campaign for return to work women.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">The total budget for the period 2000-2006 for the measure is €35 million, of which approximately €3 million is provided by the European social fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_149">My Department chairs a consultative group on male-female wage differentials which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The group is currently finalising a report to Government with proposals to address the issues raised on the gender pay gap in the ESRI report, How Unequal? Men and Women in the Irish Labour Market. That report estimated the pay gap in 1997 at 15.5% for the whole economy, based on average hourly earnings.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">My Department is represented on the management committee of the EU gender equality programme 2001-5 and is involved in a number of projects under this programme on the issue of the gender pay gap and with one project on family friendly initiatives. The 2003 round of funding under this programme is for projects on the theme of decision making and my Department is considering leading a project on this theme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">The NDP gender equality unit in my Department has been set up to provide support and advice to policy makers and implementors on gender mainstreaming. The unit is funded under the employment and human resources development programme of the NDP, with a budget of €5.36 million over the period 2000-2006.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_152">Since 2000, over 700 NDP policy makers have been trained on gender equality issues in general, and on gender equality issues in the following policy areas: training; enterprise development; urban development; agriculture and rural development; housing and transport; sports and leisure, tourism and auditors.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">The NDP gender equality unit has funded a consortium of six county development boards to be trained in gender proofing, and a gender proofing handbook has been published. Fact sheets on gender equality in 19 policy areas have also been produced. The unit has also funded research reports on women in politics and decision making, individualisation of the social welfare system, women and homelessness and women in agriculture. The unit has compiled a database of gender disaggregated statistics relevant to NDP areas, and commissioned surveys on gender and transport and gender and housing.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_155">The annual report of An Garda Síochána for 2001 shows that the 12,841 arrests made in 2001 represented a 70% increase over the number recorded in 1997, and 23% higher than the corresponding figure for 2000. Almost 90% of the samples analysed were over the legal limit.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">Over the same period, road fatalities have consistently fallen in number. In 1997, 472 fatalities were recorded. The number of road deaths in 2001 was 411, representing a 13% decrease. There were 1,242 serious injuries on our roads in 2001, representing a decrease of 43% on the 1997 levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">I am informed by the Garda authorities that they do not consider that there is any lack of resources or limitations in legislation which hinder the enforcement capability of the Garda Síochána.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">The House will be aware that there are a range of measures in the national road safety strategy to address the problem of road fatalities, including drink related facilities, which are being implemented. It is clear that the problem of drink driving cannot be solved solely by Garda enforcement and detection, but that there must also be changes in social attitudes and behaviour.</summary>

This regulation, known as Dublin II, is designed to replace the existing Dublin Convention. This is a Title IV measure under the EC treaty.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_167">Under the fourth protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Title IV measures do not automatically apply to Ireland or the United Kingdom. Ireland may participate in any Title IV instrument if we indicate our intention to "opt in" to the President of the Council within three months of the instrument being presented to Council. In the event of Ireland not opting in within the three month deadline, we may opt in only after the instrument has been adopted by the Council. However, before Ireland can indicate an intention to participate, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas must be obtained. This is a constitutional requirement under Article 29.4.6 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1495">The position in relation to children in licensed premises is that section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, provides that the holder of a licence of any licensed premises shall not allow a child, i.e. a person under the age of 15 years, to be at any time in the bar of his or her licensed premises. The licence holder may, however, allow a child to be present if the child is accompanied by his or her parent or guardian.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">The Government has approved the drafting of an amendment to the Equal Status Act, 2000, to permit a licence holder not to allow a person under the age of 15 to be in the bar of his or her licensed premises, whether or not accompanied by the parent or guardian, at certain times or at any time and that this shall not constitute discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">I agree with the views expressed by Commission on Liquor Licensing in its Second Interim Report and by the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol in its Interim Report that the admission of children to licensed premises should be restricted. The environment in licensed premises is not generally appropriate for children since it exposes them at an early age to a form of alcohol promotion that is potentially damaging to their welfare and health.</p>

          <p eId="para_1523">I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 to 176, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">It is both my policy and that of the Irish Prison Service, in common with most prison systems worldwide, not to issue needles or injecting equipment to prisoners. Emphasis within prisons is on health education and appropriate substitution treatment, etc., where required. Prisoner health education discourages injecting behaviour but also points out the health benefits of not sharing needles and injecting equipment. The report of the Group to Review the Structure and Organisation of Prison Health Care Services considered the matter of developing a syringe exchange programme within Irish prisons and came to the conclusion that, on the basis of potential risk to staff, such a step could not be recommended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">In relation to the distribution of disinfectant tablets, prison management have proposals to facilitate the provision of such tablets, initially within Mountjoy Prison, as an aid to hygiene and cleanliness. This would not condone the possession of contraband items by prisoners and staff will continue to take all possible steps to detect and confiscate any such items. These tablets are widely available in prison systems throughout Europe and have presented few practical difficulties. This has been the subject of discussion between the Irish Prisons Service and the Prison Officers' Association, regarding certain staff concerns, in which the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service continues to play a direct role, with the objective of resolving any difficulties which stand in the way of the introduction of the tablets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">While the free availability of condoms within a prison has certain health implications, there are a wider range of considerations which would have to be taken into account before contemplating the issue of condoms to serving prisoners. To date, I am not aware that there has been any demand by prisoners to have access to condoms. The matter is, however, being kept under on-going review.</p>

Houses may be provided under the scheme by local authorities building them themselves or acquiring them from a developer on a turnkey basis. The target for completion under the national development plan is 1,000 dwellings per annum. Progress has been slower than expected, in part due to the time lag between land acquisition and construction and sale. However, since the introduction of a site subsidy in June 2000 the number of transactions has increased. At the end of September 2002, a total of 598 dwellings were completed, 2,116 were under construction and 3,425 were in planning. I expect that some 800 dwellings will be completed under the scheme this year and, given the number presently under construction, I am confident that this figure will be greatly exceeded next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1542">I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 12, 31 and 56 of 28 November 2002 regarding naturally occurring uranium in drinking water from groundwater sources. As indicated in that reply, a circular letter was issued on 25 November 2002 by my Department to all local authorities with information on procedures for monitoring for the presence of uranium in drinking water supplies and measures to be taken. In addition, on 28 November 2002, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, issued an information circular to all local authorities with advice on the monitoring and sampling of drinking water for radioactivity. The RPII has advised that monitoring for radionuclides other than uranium should also be undertaken and has drawn attention to the fact that areas where high levels of uranium in drinking water are found may also be high radon areas. Accordingly, in such instances, it has recommended that measurements for indoor radon concentrations should be carried out. I understand that a number of companies, in addition to the RPII, offer a service for measuring indoor radon levels in homes.</p>

The breakdown of the allocation between the different schemes is a matter for individual authorities in the light of local circumstances.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_246">Apart from these allocations, my Department's involvement with funding for the disabled persons grant schemes relates primarily to the recoupment of up to two-thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities own resources and within the amounts included for the purpose in the local authorities own estimates of expenditure. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority on the disabled persons grant scheme without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">Significant improvements have been made to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme in recent years with a doubling of the effective maximum grant, from €10,158 in 1997 to €20,320 currently. In addition, the grant now covers 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds in 1997. The recoupment rate from my Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid has also increased, from 50% to two-thirds, and a disabled persons new house grant of up to an effective maximum of €12,700 has been introduced. I propose to make a separate allocation to local authorities in respect of disabled persons grants in 2003 and the funding of the scheme will be kept under continuing review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1549">Any issues in relation to Shanganagh Castle open prison are primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, as a general principle, the Government is committed to the identification of lands in public ownership which may be suitable for housing projects. In 2000, the Government decided to establish a National Public Property Register, under the aegis of the Department of Finance. The objective of this register is to assemble information on lands and buildings in the ownership of Departments and State agencies, including non-commercial State bodies, health boards, local authorities and certain education bodies in order to identify under utilised land and to provide a basis for the consideration of the appropriate use of these resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550">Land which is suitable for housing could either be sold to local authorities for social and affordable housing or sold for private housing with the revenues used to the support other State services. In the latter case, the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development, Act 2002, in relation to social and affordable housing would apply. My Department has encouraged local authorities to acquire land in order to address increasing housing need. Local authorities have borrowed some €430 million since 1999 for land acquisition for housing, including land acquired from public agencies.</p>
