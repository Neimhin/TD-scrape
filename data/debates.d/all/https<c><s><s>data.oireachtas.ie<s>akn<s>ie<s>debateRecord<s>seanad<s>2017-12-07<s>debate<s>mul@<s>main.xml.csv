I welcome the Minister of State here today and thank him for coming to discuss such an important issue. The reason I tabled a Commencement matter seeking Limerick to be included in the pyrite remediation scheme is because I wrote to the board that deals with pyrite, seeking Limerick to be included in the scheme, but, unfortunately, I was told that the scheme only applies to Leinster and the greater Leinster area, including Meath, Louth and Dublin. I know a lady who lives in a house with pyrite, and there are a number of similar houses alongside her. Three years ago she had a problem with her house. She approached her insurance company, which sent an assessor to her house, but that was the end of the matter. She then got an independent assessor to check her house who diagnosed pyrite and other problems. She has been told by the pyrite board that she cannot be considered for the scheme as her house is not located in the greater Leinster area or in Dublin. Unfortunately, as she does not live in the Leinster area or greater Dublin area, she does not qualify for the tax relief that applies to the local property tax, LPT, either. The pyrite remediation scheme needs to be broadened as other areas of the country have pyrite. I would like to acknowledge the fact that my colleague, Senator Mulherin, has raised the pyrite issue as it occurs in Mayo and Donegal. The problem of pyrite occurs in other places around the country and is not just confined to Dublin and the greater Dublin region. I am interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say on the matter.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	3	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I will speak on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy English. I am substituting for him as he must attend the Dáil to answer oral parliamentary questions. I wish to clarify that the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provided the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme. However, the provisions of the Act only apply to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyrite heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the sub-floor hardcore material and not to damage arising in other circumstances. Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of the buildings. Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities. They have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts. In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, that is, the home owner, the builder, the developer and-or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. Section 13(5) of the Pyrite Resolution Act does provide that the pyrite remediation scheme may, subject to the approval of the Minister of State, Deputy English, be amended, replaced or revoked by the Pyrite Resolution Board. As matters currently stand, the position is that the scheme is based on the information that was available to the board at the time of its adoption in February 2014, having regard to the details set out in the report of the pyrite panel, dated July 2012, although the scheme was subsequently amended in February 2015 in the light of relevant information that emerged in the local authority areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin with regard to pyritic heave in a small number of housing developments, that is, one development in each of the two local authority areas. Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence. The recommendations of the pyrite panel that informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme were premised on a number of pertinent factors. The Minister of State, Deputy English, supports the view that similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas given the scheme is one of last resort. At a minimum, to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the board would require a report addressing the following information: the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the Limerick city and county council area caused by pyritic heave in the sub-floor hardcore; verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite; the background to the occurrence of the damage; details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings; the history of the estate's construction, numbers, type of dwellings, etc.; the source of the hardcore supplied to the dwellings in the estate; and any supporting geological assessments. In addition, the board may also make such further inquiries as it considers necessary to assist it in considering the matter. In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, for example, to identify whether the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the sub-floor hardcore material that has given rise to pyritic heave and, consequently, significant pyritic damage.If that is the case, then it is open to the residents concerned to contact the Pyrite Resolution Board regarding the submission of a report, as I have suggested. Contact details for the board are available on its website, www.pyriteboard.ie.

We have been in contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board, but it does not seem to want to engage. It is very firm regarding the fact the scheme applies within Leinster and the greater Dublin area. Perhaps we should write to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, as well. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, can bring the matter to the attention of his colleague. We have contacted the board but it just does not seem to engage if an issue arising relates to a location outside the area to which I refer. However, we will write to the board and forward a copy to the Minister of State, Deputy English.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	The tragedy at Grenfell Tower was terrible, particularly in the context of the number of lives lost. We must learn lessons from what happened in London. There is a drive, especially under this Government's policy, towards higher-density and high-rise accommodation. In many instances, I do not disagree with that policy. However, we need to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow a response to take place if a fire were to break out. The study that was conducted identified 262 multi-storey residential buildings that have similar forms of cladding to that used at Grenfell Tower. Approximately 90 of these are residential buildings. Do fire stations know whether such buildings are located in the areas for which they are responsible? This is basic knowledge they should possess. The London Fire Brigade has changed its operating methods, that is, its pre-determined attendance. For the purposes of the pre-determined attendance, a high-rise is a building of six storeys or more or a height of over 18 m. The London Fire Brigade's pre-determined response to a fire in a high-rise called for four fire appliances, with one having high-reach capability.
This has now been changed to five appliances, one of which must have high-reach capability. Irish fire brigades are still sending only three fire appliances - one with high-reach capability - to incidents. The position in this regard to needs to change quickly. Following the fire, the London Fire Brigade ordered new aerial appliances. There are three aerial appliances in Dublin, nearly all of them second-hand. Dún Laoghaire, where high-rise development has become popular, has an aerial appliance. It is a second-hand appliance and, according to my information, it is currently off the road. If a fire were to break out at a six-storey building in the Dún Laoghaire area, it would have to be attended by one of the high-reach appliances from Tara Street or Donnybrook. That is not acceptable. If we are driving forward with the development of high-rise buildings, we must ensure that the emergency services and first responders have the equipment necessary to make the interventions that save lives. Such equipment would also protect the fire service personnel in attendance. During the inspection relating to the study that was conducted, I understand that no fire authority actually entered the buildings themselves when they carried out the assessment of the cladding. They were actually drive-by assessments whereby the engineers viewed buildings from the outside and then moved on. When we know these buildings constitute a risk, we have a responsibility to ensure that the residents know that the internal responses in the building are up to standards. Until remedial work is carried out, these buildings obviously carry a higher risk and drive-by inspections are certainly not appropriate. I am also concerned about planning. I am concentrating on the Dublin area because over 60% of all our high-rise buildings are concentrated there. From Balbriggan to Adamstown, there are real resource problems in the context of responding to fires should they break out. In Balbriggan, there is only one tender that could serve as a high-rise appliance within six minutes. Residents would have to wait for fire trucks to arrive from Phibsborough and elsewhere in order for a fire in a high-rise to be dealt with safely. The other issue about which I am concerned relates to whether people should stay or go. This was one of the primary reasons for the high loss of life at Grenfell Tower. There was an instruction for high-rise buildings that people on upper storeys should stay rather than evacuate. Have we reassessed the position in this regard? In many cases, our building regulations refer to passive controls. In other words, the structure will contain the fire and allow the firefighters to deal with it safely, while residents or office workers could remain on the higher floors. Has there been a reappraisal of whether building users should stay or leave? Can the Minister of State provide an update on some of these matters?
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	As a result of the fact that he is taking parliamentary questions in the Dáil, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, cannot be here. I am taking this matter on his behalf. On 27 June 2017, in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of fears expressed in the context of fire safety, the Minister tasked his Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management with co-ordinating a high-level task force to lead a reappraisal of fire safety in Ireland. The task force was requested to oversee and report on a number of initial steps, and to urgently consider any potential life safety issues and appropriate responses. The work of the task force involves reviewing and reappraising existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland. The task force held its first meeting on 12 July and has met seven times since, most recently on 21 November. Drafting of an interim report continues, with a view to it being submitted to the Minister in early January. A further report setting out additional proposals for the Minister's consideration is proposed later next year. As mentioned, in addition to establishing the task force, the Minister requested that a number of immediate initial actions be taken. Local authorities were asked to review their multi-storey social housing buildings to ensure that all early-warning systems, including fire alarm and detection systems, emergency lighting and means of escape are in place and fully functional. They were asked to revert to the Department with an assessment of current compliance with these lifesaving measures, as well as time-bound plans to address any issues identified. I understand that the Department has received responses from all local authorities, which have been working to address a small number of cases where issues were identified. The fire authorities were also asked to identify buildings of more than six storeys or over 18 m in height that are fitted with external cladding systems. Where such buildings were identified, fire authorities were requested to consider using their powers to require the persons having control over the premises to carry out fire safety assessments. Specifically with regard to cladding on buildings, the task force set up a subgroup to consider fire safety issues arising from cladding systems, and to prepare guidance on the fire safety assessments required by fire authorities to assist building owners, their professional advisers and the fire services. The subgroup held its first meeting on 3 October and has met on four occasions since. On foot of this work, the preparation of the guidance is at an advanced stage. It is expected that this will be issued shortly. The Senator raised the question of whether building users should stay or go. That issue will most probably be dealt with in the guidance. I will inquire as to whether it has been included. As already indicated, the task force expects to be in a position to submit an interim report to the Minister in January. It will then move on to the following phase of its work, with a view to completing a further report for the Minister's consideration later next year. Needless to say, in carrying out its work, the task force is taking into account information and developments arising in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The Senator and the House can rest assured that the task force's work will continue to be accorded the highest priority by both the Minister and the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management.

Maybe he could ask the officials to actually respond to the particular questions I raised in the first instance. I ask them to comment on the 91 residential buildings that were identified as having cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower. Is there a register in the fire stations so that the fire services actually know where those buildings are and do not attend calls blindly? I refer again to the high-lift tenders in the Dublin area, which are mainly second-hand. As I outlined, one of those servicing a substantial area of Dublin is off the road as we speak this morning.Is funding being provided to ensure that the proper equipment is in place to respond to such incidents, especially within the Dublin area? This is applicable to Cork, Limerick and Galway as well where there are also high rise buildings.

This is the first time I have had the pleasure of welcoming her to this House. I hope she is settling into her new portfolio. The issue that I am raising is quite literally a matter of life and death. I was recently made aware by Councillor Melissa O’Neill from Kilkenny of the first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, campaign, which already has 7,000 signatures. The campaign has been adopted by the health forum in ten local authorities and has the support of many Members of the Oireachtas. It was started by a Kilkenny mother whose daughter, Isabelle, has apnoea and can stop breathing at any time. She attends primary school and her mother wants all physically able teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to be trained to respond, not just to her condition but to the thousands of children and young adults who may require lifesaving first aid in schools. As a former principal, the Minister of State will know what I am talking about. Some schools have trained first responders but this is ad hoc and is not compulsory for every school. I am asking that the Minister of State make it compulsory for every school to have teachers and SNAs fully trained in first aid and to provide the necessary funding. Otherwise this will not happen.  In making my case, I am already anticipating the Minister of State's response. She may say that it is the responsibility of boards of management and not the Department under the provisions of the Education Act 1998 to be responsible for the care and safety of all students in schools. Of course this is the case and I am not disputing this. However, without compulsory first aid training and without the funding to provide it, there will be no standardised practice in schools. The Minister of State will have to take the lead on this. Otherwise we will just go around in circles like we have done with the weight of school bags, with the whole thing falling between stools of responsibility and being left up to the school or the board of management and no standardised practice across schools. In terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Applications) Regulations 2007, which set out the first aid requirements for workplaces, can the Minister of State explain how these apply to pupils who are not employees and, as such, fall into a completely different category?  Schools do a fantastic job in working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventive measures in place and to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising if a student suffers from an illness. SNAs who work with children who have medical conditions do outstanding work. However, what I am asking for is not just for children with special conditions, it is for a high level of preparedness should any incident occur. The degree of care and supervision which must be exercised by those in charge of schools has been described in a number of legal cases as, “a duty to exercise the care which a careful parent would exercise for the protection of his or her own children". In the case of children who have pre-identified medical conditions or a choking incident, the in loco parentis rule still applies. However, without the necessary training it may be impossible for teachers or SNAs to respond properly, particularly in cases where time is of the essence. I am well aware that the Department cannot direct any member of the board of management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment which is normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. What we are asking for, however, is training in treatment that can be carried out by someone who is not a medical professional but who has the training and the necessary skills. They do not have to be a nurse or doctor to do this, so that is a moot point. Among teachers and SNAs there is a great willingness to undertake this training and I have been reliably told that in addition to the Red Cross, there are plenty of reputable first aid trainers out there to do the work. The Red Cross is in the schools already working with the children. The training of teachers and SNAs would be the logical next step as the Red Cross is already providing paediatric first aid training to child care workers around Ireland.

There are loads of options. Training courses could also be offered as part of in-service training and other forms of continuous professional development or better still why not have first aid and CPR included in the curriculum in the higher diploma or professional master of education in primary education, PME, in the teacher training colleges? This is the most logical and cost-effective option. Some trainee teachers have told me they can take first aid but have to pay for it themselves. Personally, I think to expect already hard-pressed students to do external first aid courses out of their own pockets is neither fair nor feasible. The skill to save a pupil’s life should not be left to chance and should not be discretionary. It should be top priority. One of the greatest features of our education system is that children-----

The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, has asked me to take this Commencement matter. The Senator did mention I was a former school principal and yes our teachers would have been trained up voluntarily if they wanted to be, as would SNAs. That would have happened in the school and I am very aware that it does happen regularly but it is an ad hoc system. The Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of quality teacher training programmes, continuing professional development and support for principals and teachers in a range of pedagogical, curricular and educational areas. This is done through initial teacher education programmes, education centres and support services for teachers at primary and post-primary level. Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. The board of management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in its school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils. The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, advises that, by law, employers and those who control workplaces to any extent, must identify hazards in the workplaces under their control and assess the risk presented by the hazards. Employers must write down the risks and what to do about them. This is known as risk assessment. The aim of risk assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work. The risk assessment will form part of the employer’s safety statement. The safety, health and welfare at work general application regulations 2007 set out the first aid requirements for workplaces as follows: Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places of work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place. It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children, to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, appropriate treatment is available. The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child make themselves available to administer medication as required or, where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.. The Department cannot direct any member of the board of management or the teaching staff of a school to administer medical treatment to pupils, including actions or procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. The organisation of training in the administration of medicines is a matter for the board of management and my Department has no plans for future training programmes in this area. Where a child requires adult assistance in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose. It is a matter for the board of management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. Where specific training is required, the board of management should liaise with the Health Service Executive, HSE, in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. It is my Department’s experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the board of management and staff of a school and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine. The NCSE is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme. In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE was requested to establish a working group comprising relevant stakeholders to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. This working group, which is chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack, chairperson of the NCSE, has commenced its work. That work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall comprehensive review of the SNA scheme. It is intended that the reports of the working group and of the review will be completed by the end of March 2018.

That is a hallmark of the person she was, and she ran an excellent school in her time. However, the arrangements across the country are ad hoc. I am referring here to basic first aid, not to the administration of medicine. I ask the Minister of State to revert to the Minister and ask him to examine this area. It would be simple enough to provide basic first aid training as part of the teacher training programme. We are not looking for serious medical intervention here, but basic first aid. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House this morning. No doubt, we will engage again at some stage.

Thankfully their injuries are not life-threatening but the incident shows the importance of resourcing gardaí, especially when they undertake serious missions in respect of drug crime. We need to know that our gardaí are highly trained and have the very best expertise available to them so that these types of incidents do not happen again. We had a serious debate last week on An Garda Síochána, the visibility of gardaí on the beat and community gardaí. Obviously we have not seen a massive increase in the number of community gardaí. I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to set up a scheme to ensure that we see more community gardaí on the beat not only to protect individuals but so that citizens feel that little more secure in their homes. I would also like to raise the issue of home repossession lists. I was listening to Brian O'Connell on the radio this morning. He was reporting from a courthouse. One of the notable facts he reported was that there will be repossession sittings up until four days before Christmas. He also reported the commentary of a registrar on the mortgage-to-rent scheme, with which there seemed to be a lot of dissatisfaction. The registrar, Mary Delahanty, was refusing to grant adjournments to people who were seeking to apply for the mortgage-to-rent scheme on the basis that she felt it was not working. She said that she had only seen six successful applications to the scheme and that very few people were able to avail of it. Criticism of politicians was also in the ether. It was suggested that we were using the mortgage-to-rent scheme as a sort of crutch and that we thought it would solve the issue of home repossessions. It is important that we call the Minister to the House to have a serious debate on the actual success of this scheme to date, how it is working and how it is being implemented.

Yesterday we saw a joint exercise between the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána. That is to be welcomed. It is something I have been calling for for a long time. The exercise went very well and we owe compliments to the Chief of Staff and the members of the Defence Forces who showed themselves to be ready, willing and able despite the ongoing industrial relations issues within the Defence Forces. I also compliment An Garda Síochána. I hope lessons were learned and that we can see more of these exercises in the future. I would like the Deputy Leader to bring an issue back to the Taoiseach. The issue of permanent structured co-operation on security and defence, PESCO, was debated in the Dáil this week. To a certain degree the lunatics take over the asylum when anything to do with security, PESCO, European security or such matters is mentioned.There is no question of a European army being formed anywhere. No country is seeking a European army. What we are looking for is the sharing of resources and intelligence across Europe, which can only be a good thing. It is important that Ireland is a part of that. Last night, I read on social media, following a debate which took place in the Dáil, that Ireland is signing up to a European army and is throwing away its neutrality. Ireland is a militarily non-aligned state and will stay that way. The citizens of this State will decide if we are to change that - nobody else. I ask that the Government actually start to put out solid information so that people can actually debate the issues in a more rational and reasonable way. We had calls in this House to stop the development of a European army. There is no European army. Nobody wants such an army. However, do we honestly want to find ourselves in a situation where we cannot share intelligence about various subversive organisations that are operating in this country and in the wider European context? I do not believe we want to be outside that. I ask, first and foremost, that the Government provide solid information and, second, that we invite the Minister or even the Taoiseach to come to the House to debate this issue. I understand that the Government has enough on its plate at the moment. I hope, please God, that we can get somebody in here in the new year in order that we might have a rational debate on what we are talking about with PESCO rather than it being a case of people jumping into the deep end straight away.
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	23	I welcome the change of the Leader's seat to Limerick, the true capital of Ireland. Limerick abú. I was going to speak on another topic but I must take up some of Senator Craughwell's points and, indeed, call for a debate on the issue. Let us be clear. I think Senator Craughwell said that nobody is talking about a European army. I remind him of the quote from the German Minister of Defence who said "I believe that joint armed forces would be a logical consequence of an increasingly close military co-operation in Europe." After PESCO was set up in November, she said that this was another step in the direction of the army of Europeans. Let us be very clear, and the dogs on the street know this, there are huge moves ahead towards a European army. As a neutral country, we should have something to say about this topic. One of the points about PESCO is that it commits our country to increased military spending. We have a bizarre situation at the moment whereby people in our Defence Forces, for which Senator Craughwell has been a great advocate, are being paid a pittance - and some are living in poverty - while we are splashing out millions on hardware. This is a huge contradiction. I want to take up the very good point about subversive forces. We have subversive forces operating in this country. They use Shannon Airport in particular. US military forces come in on their way to the conflict in Yemen. We know there is a famine in Yemen. We know from the flight records of Shannon that US military forces are actively helping the Saudi coalition. We can see where the flights go to. They land in the capitals of the Saudi-led coalition that is causing widespread chaos, death, destruction and famine in Saudi Arabia so the idea that somehow this is not happening is frankly nonsense. I am really surprised that Senator Craughwell would say such a thing. He needs to come down and visit us at one of our protests in Shannon. We would be happy to share with him the information that is there on a regular basis. I want a debate on this topic urgently. I am proud of our neutrality. There was a time when Fianna Fáil had good things to say about our neutrality. The silence from that quarter is regrettable. Hopefully, something positive will be said today. We need a debate on this issue. Again, I remind Senator Byrne, who is deputising for the Leader, that I have asked for a debate on the disgraceful use of Shannon Airport on several occasions. It is a blight on our country. It is absolutely disgusting that US troops have filed through in their millions for wars of terror. Let us be frank about it; anyone who looks at what is happening in Syria, Libya and Yemen can see what is happening in the world. It is an absolute disgrace so let us have a debate for which I call as a matter of urgency.

I am highly insulted and disgusted. The fact that we can converse and discuss issues such as PESCO through social media is a good thing. To call people lunatics is very unfair and damaging so I wish Senator Craughwell would take back his remark. I agree with my colleague from Sinn Féin because I also believe that there is more to PESCO than we are hearing about. I am disgusted that our Government will potentially sign a document today that, again, has the potential to erode our sovereignty and neutrality. It is wrong and should be turned about. I implore the Taoiseach to come to this House as soon as possible to debate the issue of PESCO. We need transparency, which has been lacking; we need debate, which has been clearly lacking; and we need to know what the mechanism for our country to turn about a decision with regard to the signing of PESCO is. It definitely is not the right thing for the people of Ireland. We must have the debate and enable the people to come to the representatives of the Oireachtas and let their voice be heard. I am disappointed with Fianna Fáil. We are not hearing the voice of Fianna Fáil regarding the potential risks PESCO poses to this country. I agree with Senator Craughwell that members of our armed forces need proper salaries and terms and conditions. There is no doubt about that but with regard to signing PESCO, we do not know what is the hidden potential cost for our country. We have always been the voice of reason and peace in international negotiations. PESCO is the wrong way for our country to go so I ask that the Taoiseach come to the House as soon as possible to discuss it.

We heard from a wide range of interested and knowledgeable people. As Senators are aware, the copyright on the anthem expired in 2012. We heard from Conal Kearney, grandson of the author of the anthem, Peadar Kearney, who told us something we already believe, namely, that the national anthem should be given the respect and dignity it deserves. Interestingly, he also corrected a widespread belief that the anthem was written in 1907 and pointed out that it was written in late 1910 or early 1911. The song was translated into Irish by the civil servant and linguist Liam Ó Rinn. His grand-nephew, Councillor Nial Ring, appeared before the committee and told us that the anthem was first published in 1923. A very interesting article on the subject by Liam Collins appeared in yesterday's Irish Independent. As we know, "Amhrán na bhFiann" links us to our history and, therefore, our identity. The Seanad Public Consultation Committee, with the aid of our rapporteur, my fellow Kerryman Senator Mark Daly, will now prepare a report with recommendations, if any, for the Government and the Seanad. I ask that in due course, the Deputy Leader arrange that we can debate it in the Seanad.

I suppose it highlights once again the dangers the men and women of An Garda Síochána face so that the rest of us can go about our daily lives in a safe fashion. Today, I acknowledge the honour and bravery of our gardaí as the Scott Medal ceremony is due to take place in Templemore tomorrow. The Scott Medal is the highest award An Garda Síochána can bestow on a member of the force.It is awarded where a member has risked his or her life in the execution of his or her duty. Seven of our bravest and most honourable gardaí will be recognised for their courage and bravery in performing their duties. Sadly, two of these gardaí gave the ultimate sacrifice of their lives and the lives of the five others were changed forever. It is 41 years since the Garryhinch ambush incident in County Laois. I am sure it will be a very emotional day for the Peters family, the Cannon family, the Thornton family and the Bohan family as they receive the Scott medal. It will be an especially poignant and sad occasion for the Clerkin family from Monaghan town, who will received the posthumous award on behalf of Michael Clerkin, who tragically died on that horrific day aged just 24 years. I also acknowledge the family of Garda Tony Golden, who will also receive the Scott medal. Garda Golden, as members recall, was shot dead two years ago as he defended a young woman after she had been attacked by her partner. The seventh recipient of the Scott medal is Detective Garda Dominick Hutchin, who confronted two armed raiders in Dublin in 1987 and suffered severe injuries in that act. In acknowledging the bravery and courageous actions of these gardaí to protect our country and our way of life, the words of Elmer Davis, an American journalist during the Second World War, hold true. He said a "nation will remain the home of the free only so long as it is a home of the brave".

I believe the European Union has no legitimacy in military and defence matters and it should be left to member states, and that international peacekeeping and conflict resolution should happen under the auspices of the United Nations. Successive EU treaties since the Single European Act in 1987, including the Nice treaty, have eroded independent foreign policy to the point where military neutrality, although seriously undermined, is virtually all we have left. The EU has become increasingly militarised since the first reference to EU military co-operation and common defence appeared in the Maastricht treaty. It is clear the EU treaties taken together aim to reconstruct the EU as a military superpower. I ask Senator Craughwell to take note. The need for intervention to halt the momentum of EU militarisation has never been more urgent, yet the Government, on behalf of this supposedly neutral State, has done very little, if anything, to oppose these developments. It has done even less to protect Irish neutrality and improve Ireland's negotiating position for a future in an EU that is even more heavily dominated by NATO states. At the very least, the Government should demand a legally binding neutral protocol for Ireland. It should also show leadership and co-ordinate with other EU neutral states in an effort to persuade other member states in our European Union to drop or reduce the EU military dimension. Ireland should promote the redirection of EU defence and peacekeeping resources towards the United Nations. This is the perspective Sinn Féin brings to the heart of the European Union and I second the proposal by Senator Gavan. Senator Higgins will make a similar proposal.

It has to be regretted. I am happy the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has dealt with this publicly and expressed his concern about it. Jerusalem is looked to by both the Palestinian and Israeli communities as their capital. We support, as do the UN resolutions, a two-state solution to this conflict. We support ongoing peaceful negotiations. We are concerned about the social and economic conditions of the Palestinian people. As spokesperson, I unequivocally and openly express my annoyance, my opposition to it and my desire that it might be the subject of discussion in the House in a more formalised way, if that could be facilitated. I take a more nuanced approach to the PESCO question than did Senator Craughwell. While not questioning his personal bona fides, we must be vigilant with PESCO to ensure Irish neutrality is preserved and that we do not enter military alliances. Although I am in favour of security co-operation and maintaining peace, I am not in favour of blindly walking into military alliances. This needs vigilance. I ask the Deputy Leader to secure a visit by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House in order that this can become the subject of more debate. We certainly should have a more nuanced position. I support Senator Gavan in this regard. I do not think we can take it as simply as that. With regard to Senator Gallagher's remarks on Garda Michael Clerkin, I am personally delighted to congratulate the Clerkin family. I have supported this for some time and have indicated this support in a number of ways in the past. It is long overdue that Garda Clerkin is to be recognised for his bravery. I am delighted he is to get the Scott medal. It is a tragedy he will not be there himself to receive it. He was a man of valour and quality and we are proud he was a native of County Monaghan. The incident in which Garda Clerkin lost his life happened in the constituency of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and I presume he was central to this exercise.

We need to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, because this will have a fundamental impact on our foreign affairs policy and our record on disarmament. I recognise they may be at the Brexit negotiations, in which case we can look to the Minister of State with responsibility for defence. This is much bigger than a defence issue. It is a change in direction for Ireland. There is a difference between humanitarian rescue of migrants and engaging in the funding of countries that shoot at migrants. There is a difference between missions which are UN peacekeeping missions and missions that have some part of them sanctioned or agreed to by the UN and are bordering on NATO missions.

It is deeply patronising to the Irish public that it has been told that somehow it inadvertently signed up to this when it signed up to the Lisbon treaty. We had that from the Taoiseach last night. Let us be very clear; in so far as issues of common defence were discussed with regard to the Lisbon treaty, it was in the form of assurances that we would not be jumping into common defence arrangements and that we would ensure and protect our unique role. I have to hand transcribed lengthy debates by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in which they assured us vigorously of that fact.The context for my proposal is that participation in PESCO is an option that is being chosen by the Government. It is not necessary. It is a disgrace to Frank Aiken, who started the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and championed neutrality for Ireland, that Fianna Fáil is supporting this move. Unfortunately, some of their spokespersons in the Dáil are cheerleading the militarisation approach. Ireland, which has been a champion of disarmament, has committed to annual increases in military spending. This money will not necessarily go to front-line soldiers and workers. PESCO will set out where it will go. This relates to common arms treaties. When I was at the cluster munitions negotiations in Ireland, I met people who had lost limbs to the kinds of munitions that are manufactured and used by-----

I suggest it would be timely for another one of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services to be implemented. I refer to the recommendation that there should be parity of esteem between people living in the countryside who have been paying for their water and people living in urban centres who have been getting free water off the public mains. The first point I want to make in this regard relates to people who are waiting for new group water schemes to be constructed. My home county, Mayo, is especially affected by such delays. Seven areas have been waiting since 2010, when CLÁR funding was abandoned by a previous Government, for a new group water scheme to be built. The people in those areas cannot drink the water in their taps or use the water to wash their clothes. They are incurring considerable additional expense because the naturally occurring water in the terrain around them is not fit for consumption. They have waited and waited. They have paid for consultants. The scheme in question even went as far as a tender process before it went by the wayside when the CLÁR funding was abolished. Such schemes need to be looked after and funded in the context of the 2016-18 multi-annual rural water programme. People in parts of County Mayo like Kilmurry, Downpatrick, Carrowcastle and Fermoyle need to be given some hope that in the last year of the multi-annual funding programme, they will finally get some good news after many years of waiting. I might add that the people in question have absolutely no problem paying for their water. The second point I want to make in this regard relates to people who are paying for their water through group water schemes, which are subsidised at the moment. It has been established that the subsidy paid by the Government is not enough to create parity of esteem with people in towns and cities. Group water schemes need increased funding. There must be an announcement in that regard. People in rural Ireland need fairness when it comes to water. It is time for the Government to do more than pay lip service to this issue.

Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an leasú ar Riar na hOibre atá curtha chun cinn ina leith sin. I am seconding the amendment to the Order of Business and adding to the concerns about PESCO. Yesterday evening, we had the honour of hosting a number of MPs from Catalonia in the House. They came to Ireland to discuss the election campaign that is happening there at the moment, to raise concerns about that process and to ask us to do a number of things. A number of people from Ireland travelled to Catalonia in October to act as international observers during the referendum there. There are concerns that there will be no international observation of the elections that are taking place on 21 December next. It is important for every election process to be robust, fair, open and transparent. The Irish Government can play a role in this regard by asking the Spanish Government to allow it to send people to observe the process in line with international best practice. MPs in Catalonia are concerned that people wearing yellow ribbons in favour of politicians and civic representatives who have been imprisoned will not be allowed to go into polling stations and that posters which say "Democracy" and "Yes" will not be allowed to be hung in public places. They raised many other issues relating to the dissemination of information, how people are being portrayed in the media and the language that can and cannot be used. They are very concerned about such issues. Our Government should be asking the EU to send international observers to the elections in Catalonia. We are not taking any sides when we say there is a need to make sure the process is run in a proper manner and is fair and open. If we are happy that this is the case, it is incumbent on us to call on the Spanish Government to make sure it respects the vote and the democratic right of the people, regardless of the result of the election. Maybe at that stage we will be able to help by calling for international mediation around the crisis in Catalonia. I ask the Deputy Leader to put that to the Minister. Maybe we can have a debate in the new year on the result of the Catalan elections.

I want to raise the impending arrival of Storm Caroline in the next few hours or days. It will bring 110 km/h winds, snow and sleet to many parts of Ireland. It is amazing that people in some parts of west Cork still have not got their telephones back in order since the storm that hit Ireland six or seven weeks ago. People on Sherkin Island will be waiting for another three weeks, at least, for a cable that was damaged in that storm to be relaid. We have to look at how we are going to respond to and prepare for these storms, which are now occurring more frequently than they did in the past. It is important for us to have a real debate on how we will deal with these issues. The storm that hit the south and west coasts of Ireland six or seven weeks ago was somewhat forgotten by the Dublin media. As a result of this significant storm, many parts of counties Cork and Kerry suffered power outages for six or seven days. We need to have a real debate on how we are preparing for such events, with a particular focus on the processes that are in place and how we are going to deal with these issues. It is appalling that some parts of west Cork are still without telephone landlines. A real debate is required to ensure these processes can be looked at. We have to do better in this day and age.

The reality is that there will be far more of these storms in the future. The effects of such storms will extend beyond the telephone and electricity lines to the crops that are growing throughout this country. Senator Lombard is going to have to be realistic about these issues. We are part of the cause and part of the problem. Our transport and agriculture emissions are rising. I accept that strong improvements have been made in the agriculture sector. It has increased its output and its emissions. If we want a holistic discussion on the big picture, we need to have an honest debate with ourselves.We must show leadership on climate change. We have to reduce our emissions. We should not accept the idea that we are not going to reach our 2020 targets. We must have a realistic and positive discussion about the fuels we burn, how we generate our electricity and so forth. I look forward to the adoption of a more holistic approach, but people will have to leave their baggage at the door and start considering the bigger picture. We must consider the effects of climate change not only on west Cork and Dublin, but on the world. We can be leaders in that debate but we should aspire to be leaders by example rather than just leaders in making noise on the issue.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to table a Commencement matter relating to the fire service earlier. However, I ask the Acting Leader to raise the issue of Commencement matters with Ministers generally. I am concerned at the quality of the responses to important Commencement matters, including the one raised by Senator Byrne herself today. I do not think the officials are doing the Ministers any justice at all with the replies they are providing. I would very much appreciate it if the Leader of the House would raise that with Ministers. I am not simply referring to my own Commencement matter. Several Senators have raised this issue with me. I have looked at some of the responses they received and they are simply not good enough. We do not have the facility to table parliamentary questions and can only raise issues with Ministers through the Commencement matters debate. Ministers should be properly prepared and should provide the information that has been requested.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	52	I support Senator Joe O'Reilly's comments on the proposal by the US to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. As someone who has visited Gaza, I would be seriously concerned about this proposal. I was there in 2009 and nothing has changed since then. In late 2008 and early 2009, some 340 children were killed when the Israelis used white phosphorous and cluster munitions but no international sanctions were imposed on Israel. I am seriously concerned at this new move by the US. I believe that Europe can play a very important role here. I do not believe the US can resolve the issue in Gaza and Israel and the EU must bring its influence to bear. In terms of Irish troops and EU involvement, our troops have always been involved in peacekeeping and have been major influencers in that regard. I saw that myself when there was a UN mandate for troops to go into Chad and to the Sudanese border area. The UN could not come up with the troops. There was an agreement with the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that Ireland would provide the troops under an EU operation. It was interesting to attend a committee meeting, which was held in private, in the European Parliament at which a member of the British army advised that the Irish contingent had achieved more in six months than the French had achieved in 30 years. That is evidence of the contribution that we, as peacekeepers, can make in areas of conflict around the world. In the aforementioned area, there were over 570,000 people in refugee camps drawn from four different countries, including Chad itself. The role the Irish troops played there was substantial and it influenced how other peacekeepers operated. It is important to keep that in mind.

The N5 is the road between Dublin and Westport. The road upgrade will bypass the villages of Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown. This is a major endorsement of the Government's policy of improving access to the west. That said, more needs to be done, particularly on the N4 between Dublin and Sligo and particularly between Sligo and Longford. Approximately €100 million has been allocated for a road project near Castlebaldwin, which is very welcome. Over the years we have seen preferential treatment being given to the road network linking Dublin and Belfast, Dublin and Cork, and Limerick and Galway. The area between Galway and Belfast needs much more investment and focus from the Government in terms of ensuring that we have the best possible networks. That said, today is a very good day after years and years of trying to get funding.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	54	I thank the 20 Senators who contributed on the Order of Business today. Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the shooting of a member of An Garda Síochána this morning and I am sure we all share Senator Ardagh's sentiments in that regard. I know that there was a call for a debate recently on community gardaí. Community gardaí play a very significant role in my own area. It seems that there is a shortage of community gardaí in some areas, while in other areas they are plentiful. That is an issue that I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Senator also raised the issue of home repossessions. Again, I am happy to raise that matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and to ask him to come to the House for a debate on it. Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Gavan, Craughwell, Warfield, O'Reilly, Higgins, Davitt and Ó Clochartaigh all raised the issue of PESCO, on which I have a note. PESCO is a mechanism provided for under the Treaty of the European Union to enable countries to come together voluntarily, on a project by project basis, to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in the support of CSDP operations. On Monday, 13 November, at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, attended by foreign and defence Ministers, 23 member states signed the PESCO notification which sets out the agreed framework on which PESCO will operate. The formal launch of PESCO is expected to happen at the December Foreign Affairs Council. Ireland was not in a position to sign the notification document as we have a clear national decision-making process that must be followed. When Ireland approved the Lisbon treaty in 2009, the requirements to join PESCO were set out in legislation. As the PESCO notification provides for contributing to the enhancement of capabilities for UN mandated missions, the Government decided that Ireland should participate in the initiative. The next phase in the decision-making process will be a Dáil decision, which will take place on Friday, 8 December.  The matter will be debated in the Dáil but it has been agreed that a Minister will come to this House to discuss it. Unfortunately, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, is currently answering Leaders' Questions in the Dáil and following that he will be tied up with the Brexit negotiations. The Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, is not in the House today. The Taoiseach is also tied up today. It has been agreed, therefore, that a Minister will come to the House next week to discuss the matter. A number of Senators asked that the Taoiseach would come to the House. I wish to confirm that he will come to Seanad Éireann in early January. He is coming in to discuss this and many other issues. That has been confirmed and a date has been provisionally set and is awaiting approval by the party leaders. Unfortunately, neither the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade nor the Minister of State at the Department of Defence is available today. They will be available next week to debate the matter. I hope that is satisfactory. Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the meeting of the Seanad
Public Consultation Committee on Tuesday last on the national anthem and called for further debate in the House on the matter. I am sure that will be facilitated in the near future, following the publication of the recommendations of the aforementioned committee. Senators Gallagher and O'Reilly raised the issue of the Scott medal and made particular reference to those who have waited 41 years for the awarding of such medals.I pay tribute to the seven gardaí who will be honoured tomorrow for their bravery and heroism, two of whom, sadly, are no longer with us.  Senator Warfield also raised the issue of PESCO and Ireland's neutrality. Senator O'Reilly raised the issue of President Trump's proposal to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has expressed his concerns on that matter but I will bring the Senator's remarks to his attention. Senator Colm Burke raised the same issue and I will also bring his comments to the attention of the Minister.  Senator Higgins asked that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House today for a debate on the PESCO. I have already set out the position in that regard.

She also spoke about the multi-annual rural water programme. I will raise these issues with the Minister because it is important there is discussion on the fact that people in rural areas are paying for water while others are receiving water payment refunds. Senator Ó Clochartaigh supported the call for a debate on PESCO. He also spoke about Ireland's role in terms of observation of the Catalonian elections due to take place shortly and the need for the Spanish Government to respect the democratic process. I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  Senator Lombard raised the issue of Storm Caroline. I pay tribute to the Government and all those involved in the work undertaken in regard to the recent storms we experienced. I note Senator Lombard's point that phone lines in some areas have still not been restored. I will bring to the attention of the Leader the need for the Minister to come to the House to address that issue and to outline what preparations are being made for future storms.  Senator Humphreys agreed with the points made by Senator Lombard and also spoke about the need for a holistic approach to climate change. I will bring his comments to the attention of the Minister for Communicates, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Naughten. Senator Burke supported the comments made by Senator O'Reilly. He also spoke about the involvement of Irish troops in EU peacekeeping missions and made the point that we have achieved more in six months than other countries have in 30 years. It is important to acknowledge the work of Irish troops serving abroad and their separation from their families, particularly at this time of the year. Senator Feighan raised the issue of the N5 upgrade, An Bord Pleanála and the preferential treatment given to road projects linking Dublin and Belfast, Dublin and Cork, and Limerick and Galway.  I would like to clarify that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, will take the debate on PESCO in the Dáil.

As Senators will know, the Social Welfare Bill 2017 provides the legislative framework for the implementation of the social protection measures contained in budget 2018. The Bill therefore includes the provisions required to enable a €5 increase in the maximum rate of all weekly social welfare payments with effect from March 2018. It also provides for a €2 weekly increase for each qualified dependent child, the first such increase since 2010. There are also important provisions which enable the extension of entitlement to maternity leave and maternity benefit in cases of premature births. The Bill is reflective of the approach taken by Government in framing our budget for 2018. There is a genuine commitment to supporting individuals and families who, for one reason or another, have recourse to the welfare system. There is a real commitment to making work pay and to supporting people into employment. This is set against a backdrop of the Government’s drive to the continued development of a sustainable and resilient economy in the interests of all of our citizens. I would like to briefly outline the provisions of the Bill. I should mention at the outset that the Bill includes three specific amendments, providing for the production of reports on specific policy areas, which were passed on Report Stage in the Dáil yesterday evening. Sections 1 and 2 are standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill, its construction and citation, commencement provisions and definitions of terms used in the Bill. Section 3 provides for an amendment to the definition of the term “share based remuneration” to cater for the introduction of a new tax relief being introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. This tax relief is the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, for qualifying share options granted to employees of small to medium-sized enterprises.In practical terms, the effect of the small amendment in section 3 is to provide that any gains realised on the exercise of a share option by workers via the KEEP programme will not be subject to PRSI. Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for an increase of €5 per week in the rates of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit, respectively, with effect from 26 March 2018. Section 7 provides for the proportionate increases in the rates of jobseeker’s benefit which are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are relatively low. Section 8, together with Schedule 1, provide for the redesignation of the family income supplement as the working family payment with effect from the 1 January. This follows on from a review by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection of the effectiveness of the range of in-work supports which it provides. The title of working family payment will explicitly reflect the nature of the payment and our aim is to facilitate further take-up of this important payment which is aimed specifically at working families.  Section 9 is the first of the amendments to the Bill which was passed on Report Stage. It provides that my Department will produce a report on the operation of the working family payment and present it to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection within six months. The redesignation of family income supplement, FIS, as the working family payment in January will be accompanied by a national promotional and information campaign designed to encourage as many eligible families as possible to apply for the working family payment. While it would have been preferable to allow for the effects of that promotional campaign to become clear, the review will focus on addressing such issues as the impact of the "hours worked" threshold under the scheme. A key issue always is to ensure that the working family payment should not become a vehicle for subsidising unsuitably low earnings or that it would encourage or incentivise employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  In section 10 we provide for an increase of €10 in the weekly earnings thresholds for the working family payment for recipients who have up to three children, with effect from 29 March 2018. Section 11 provides for another positive measure to support the transition from unemployment into employment by enabling the continuation of the back to work family dividend. Under the sunset clause contained in the existing legislation, this scheme would have to be closed to new claimants from the end of March 2018 and the scheme would have been completely shut down by 2021. The Bill provides now for the removal of that sunset clause because we recognise the value of the back to work family dividend payment. Section 12, together with Schedule 2, is one of the key provisions of the Bill. It provides for new rates for the full range of social insurance benefits. All maximum weekly insurance-based pensions and benefits are being increased by €5, with effect from the week commencing 26 March 2018, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments. This section also provides for proportionate increases in respect of qualified adults together with an increase of €2 per week in the qualified child increase payment. Section 13 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payment, from €110 to €130 per week, and that is also effective from 29 March 2018.  Section 14 together with Schedule 3 mirrors the provisions of section 11 on the increase in the rates payable to social assistance claimants which will come into effect in the week commencing 26 March 2018. This section also provides that jobseekers aged under 26 on a reduced rate payment will receive the full €5 increase per week. Sections 15 and 16 provide an important additional support for the parents of babies who are born prematurely. Under these provisions, extended periods of entitlement to maternity benefit and maternity leave are being introduced in cases of premature births which occur on or after the 1 October 2017 start date. In practical terms, the extended period of entitlement will be equivalent to the duration between the actual date of birth of the premature baby and two weeks before the expected date of birth. That is the point at which the current entitlement to 26 weeks of maternity leave and benefit would normally begin. By way of illustration, where a baby is born in the 30th week of gestation, the child’s mother will have an additional entitlement of approximately seven weeks of maternity leave and benefit. This additional period will be added to the mother’s normal entitlement to 26 weeks of maternity leave and benefit.  Section 15 introduces the necessary changes to the Social Welfare Act to provide for the additional maternity benefit while section 16 introduces the parallel provisions to the Maternity Protection Act 1994 on maternity leave. Section 17 provides for an amendment to the National Training Fund Act 2000 to provide for a 0.1% increase, from 0.7% to 0.8%, in the national training fund levy payable by employers in respect of reckonable earnings of employees in class A and class H employments from 1 January 2018.  Section 18 is the second of the amendments passed on Report Stage in the Dáil last evening. This amendment merely restates commitments I have already given to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the issue of the impact of the changes introduced in 2012 to the qualifying conditions for the State contributory pension. I have no doubt but that Senators are familiar with the issues involved. My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the rate bands not been amended in 2012. If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, particularly if they had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the homemakers scheme, I will ask Government to consider if and how these might be financed. Once the report is finished, I will be bringing it to the next Cabinet sub-committee on pensions, which has been set for 18 January. Thereafter, I will bring proposals to Government for consideration. At that stage I will then publish the options paper.  Section 19 is the final section of the Bill and is the third of the amendments passed on Report Stage. It provides that my Department will examine the issues associated with the rent-a-room tax relief and how income from renting out a room is treated in the means testing for the one-parent family payment. In this regard, I should say that the consideration of the issue will necessarily have to take account of wider means testing policies. Briefly, it would be problematic to provide for a disregard for rent-a-room income for the one-parent family payment scheme in isolation from all of the other support schemes that we have. For instance, once the recipient’s child turned seven years of age and the person transferred to the jobseeker’s transitional payment, if there was any rental income then it would become assessable if we were just to do what is hoped to have been provided for with amendment.  The Bill before us will have a positive impact on the living standards of pensioners, lone parents, people with disabilities, carers, jobseekers and others who have recourse to the social protection system. For the second budget in a row, an increase of €5 per week in social welfare rates is being provided for. I hope that is clear evidence of the Government’s commitment to ensuring that all of our citizens should benefit from the continuing economic recovery that the country is now experiencing. I am particularly pleased that this Bill provides for the first increase in the weekly qualified child payment since 2010. I am particularly conscious that we still have far too many children consistently living below the poverty line. I am also happy that the Bill is responding positively to the needs of parents where a child is born prematurely. I look forward to the contributions of this House in relation to this Bill and I commend this Bill to the House.
#CatherineArdagh	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-party	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-dob	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	72	We are happy to support the Social Welfare Bill. The aim of this Bill is primarily to give legislative effect to a range of increases in social welfare payments announced in budget 2018. Fianna Fáil will be supporting this Bill, but we will be bringing forward a number of amendments. Deputy O'Dea was successful in the Dáil yesterday in bringing forward an amendment to section 8 to insert the following: "The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall review the operation of the Working Family Payment, including the requirement that you must be working 19 hours per week, 38 hours per fortnight, to qualify for the payment, and shall bring forward a report to the Committee on Social Protection on same within six months of this Bill being enacted."He was also successful in bringing forward an amendment on page 13, after line 38, to insert the following: "The Minister will publish the report on the effects of the 2012 pension bands and rates changes immediately after it has been considered by the Cabinet." The third amendment he was successful in bringing forward was on page 13, after line 38, to insert the following: "The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall review the impact of removing income generated from rent-a-room relief from the means test for those in receipt of the one-parent family payment and shall bring forward a report on the same within six months of this Bill being enacted." While budget 2018 was far from perfect and contained only modest gains for those on low and fixed incomes, Fianna Fáil through its influence and determination to create a fairer Ireland, ensured that it was at least a step in the right direction. We are proud to have once again secured a €5 per week increase in the State pension. This is the second year in a row that Fianna Fáil has secured such an increase resulting in State pensions rising by a total of €10.We also welcome the €5 increase in other weekly payments and the increase in the qualified child payment. This Bill gives effect to these increases. We also welcome that this Bill extends entitlement to maternity benefit and maternity leave in cases of premature births. This is a welcome measure and will provide a degree of comfort to mothers in what is a very stressful situation. This Bill, however, does not deal with the issue of pension equality, which our amendment tries to address, or the disastrous changes introduced by Fine Gael and Labour in 2012 to the bands for the contributory pension, which had an adverse effect on older people and women in particular. Fianna Fáil recently brought forward a motion to reverse the 2012 changes, which was passed in the Dáil. In addition, Deputy Willie O’Dea tabled amendments on Committee Stage of this Bill to reverse the changes introduced in 2012 but these were ruled out of order. Finally, this Bill renames the family income supplement, FIS, as the working family payment. We had hoped that the Minister would have taken a more imaginative approach to reforming the social welfare system and fulfilling a commitment made in the programme for Government to introduce a new working family payment. Fianna Fáil believes that this payment should be reviewed with a view to revising the 38-hour rule to create a sliding scale in order to reflect the fact that many people may be working less than 19 hours per week and may be in just as much need as those currently receiving this payment. We believe that such a move has the potential to benefit lone parents, in particular those who are parenting alone and are the sole carers of their children. We are happy to support the Bill and we look forward to the new rates being introduced in March.

The Social Welfare Bill proposes to give effect to social welfare and related matters as announced in budget 2016. These include measures to provide an increase in the maximum payment rate for weekly social protection payments. The Bill provides for an increase in the weekly rate of maternity and adoptive benefits and that has to be welcomed. There are always limits in resources for the budget but the Minister has given priority to areas which are particularly important. The Bill also proposes to increase the earnings thresholds for working family payments and makes amendments to maternity leave and benefits. This is also excellent, particularly in cases of premature births in which regard it is timely and appropriate. It also seeks to make amendments to the National Training Fund Act 2000. I thank the Minister for increasing the rate of farm assist, albeit only by a moderate €5. It is an important gesture in the right direction. I wish the Minister well and this Bill is worthy of support. There are proposed changes to social insurance and social assistance payments, which are set out in the memorandum and which were touched on by the Minister in her speech. It is a beginning and I know she would like to increase it by more in the future. I acknowledge her work. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to speak directly to the Minister and I wish to acknowledge the responses of her and her Department to the representations we make on social protection issues. I am always highly impressed that we get an acknowledgement within days and then there is a follow-up, including a personal follow-up from the Minister with her signature on it. It makes a difference when a Minister takes an interest in public representatives who make representations. The other day, I asked why somebody could not do as the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, does and they replied that she was a tough taskmaster. I said that was fantastic as it meant she got things done. She is on a mission and fair play to her. It is great for public representatives to have a strong working relationship with a Minister as committed as Deputy Doherty.

I had the privilege of working with her on the health committee for five years and she made a huge contribution. The experience she gained there will stand to her in her new role. It is great that she has come to the House today to talk about a budget that includes increases, which have occurred directly as a result of the number of new jobs that have been created and the number of people back at work. We now have over 250,000 more people at work than there were in 2011 and 2012 and, as a result, we can give support to the people who need it, whether they are retired people or people in health or employment difficulties. It is important that we recognise the contribution social welfare can make to a person's life in helping them to get back onto the rung on the ladder they were on before and then onto better things. There has been criticism of JobPath and other measures the Department took but they were the correct measures. It is about making sure everyone gets the opportunity to do things they are good at and acquire the skills to enable them to fulfil their aims in life. The Minister went through the various increases in the Bill, such as changes to maternity benefit, increases in paternity benefit and additional support for families where there has been a premature birth, when there is an immediate loss of work in many cases. She also increased the one-parent family allowance disregard, from €110 to €130 from 29 March, which is welcome as it assists people to get back into long-term employment. One issue on which we need to work relates to the self-employed. We have brought about important changes in this area and will continue to do so but a person who has been self-employed for some time and who runs into major health problems finds that the social welfare process is a slow one for them. Often, they do not have insurance against their business folding or against losing work because of the cost involved. I know of one person whose application has taken quite some time to process. I do not blame the Department as it is complying with the rules and regulations but we need to look at it. These people took the risk of trying to provide for themselves through self-employment and when it goes badly wrong, as it does from time to time especially in cases of major health problems, they do not have the back-up support and we need to be able to respond to genuine cases in a timely manner. I know changes cannot be made on this occasion but, in the long term, I would like to see some in this area.Overall, we are going down the right road in respect of the way we have dealt with social welfare and the way we are dealing with it now. The other big challenges we have in social welfare are in respect of elderly care and the long-term cost of both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. I mention this issue with regard to the increase in the number of people over 65. That number is currently 637,000. It will be more than 1 million within ten years. That is a huge challenge for us and we need to start planning for it in many different areas. Figures released in the last few weeks show that life expectancy in this country has continued to increase. Since 2000, life expectancy has increased by something like five years. This is evidence of the contribution being made by people who are in receipt of social welfare and are better able to care for themselves and of the contribution of the health services. While we might criticise the health services, this increase in life expectancy indicates that we must be getting something right.  This increase poses a challenge in respect of the costs of servicing the increased number of retired people. It is important we plan for that. The one good thing is that the numbers coming into employment continue to increase. I have worked out that the ratio of working people to retired people is now 3.1:1. If the number of retired people increases to 1 million, we would have to achieve huge job figures to maintain that ratio. It is a challenge on which we need to work. Overall, I thank the Minister for the work she is doing. I thank all of the officials in her Department. Like Senator Boyhan, I thank those who respond to the queries we raise. I appreciate the help I get in that regard and how efficiently queries are responded to.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	76	This morning the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection admitted that the welfare cheats campaign was a mistake. That is a welcome development. Social welfare is about protecting those of us who are most at risk and most vulnerable. It has become somewhat typical of previous Governments and the current Government to try to erode these institutions. Fine Gael policies often seek to exploit society, as I mentioned in my introduction, and to divide it or to moralise about social welfare payments. The Taoiseach in particular and the Government in general have sought to morally justify those social inequalities. Such behaviour facilitates a politics of division. It makes the task of designing an approach to social welfare that actively seeks to confront and eradicate those divisions more difficult. The increases in social welfare payments, the continuation of the back-to-work dividend and the extension of maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies, among other provisions in this Bill, are to be welcomed. We commend the Minister on those measures. We also perceive significant flaws and have many major concerns. These concerns were brought up by my colleague, Deputy John Brady, in the Dáil where they were not sufficiently dealt with. I ask the Minister to deal with those concerns here today and as the Bill progresses through the Houses.  One such issue is that of the 42,000 older people who have been stripped of their State pensions because of the 2012 changes to pension bands and rates. These changes disproportionately affected women. They were discriminated against for starting to work at an early age or for taking time out to look after their families. I am happy to see that an amendment was passed late last night that brings forward the date by which this anomaly will be dealt with. That is welcome.  The increase of €2 in qualified child payments within the Bill is disappointing. While the Government talks about a growing economy and releases statement after statement welcoming falling live register figures, I wonder what happens to the 140,000 people living in consistent poverty in this State. What about the majority of lone parents who are living in deprivation and cannot afford a warm coat for their children or to heat their own homes? There is a consistent poverty rate of 26.2% among children in lone-parent families. That is more than three times the consistent poverty rate for children in two-parent families. When it comes to tackling child poverty, especially among lone-parent families where it is most prevalent, we need targeted measures and adequate increases. On Committee Stage in the Dáil, Sinn Féin tabled an amendment to this Bill that called for a report on the impact of cuts to the fuel allowance. After discussions with the Minister, there was agreement to that amendment once it was slightly re-worded. Despite this, the Government refused to accept the amendment on Report Stage yesterday. Will the Minister outline why that was the case? We intend to table this amendment next week and hope the Minister will accept it.  I am also thinking today about the young people who are on reduced rates of jobseeker's payments because of their age. What is a growing economy doing for those young people? Our young job seekers continue to receive reduced levels of jobseeker's payments while facing the exact same costs. Their rents are not cheaper, neither is their food. It is highly unlikely that they hold any fixed assets such as, for example, houses or cars. This is discrimination. This is about citizenship. It is about young people being at peace with their lives. Sinn Féin believes in a better society that is equal and fair. We are on the side of the ordinary people who struggle to make ends meet.  I would be grateful if the Minister could address some of those concerns in her response.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	77	I welcome the Minister to the House. I first acknowledge there are some positive measures in the Bill which has been put forward. I will, of course, be supporting those measures. There are some progressive elements, particularly in respect of maternity benefit. With regard to the payment increases, we must note that those on reduced rates will not be receiving €5 extra including, for example, those on reduced rates of pensions, who are predominantly women. They will be receiving a pro rata, lower amount of €3. I will come to pensions. I know the Minister is keen to progress that issue. I will come to it later. The other positive elements are the increase in qualified child payment and the partial restoration of the income disregard for the lone parent allowance. I point out, however, that we still have a lower disregard than we originally did. That is still a work in progress. We have acknowledged that it was counterproductive as a policy measure. It is important that we move further towards reversing that reduction.  I acknowledge that the Minister has a personal interest in the area of lone parents. She has been very clear that she wants to address the issue and that she recognises that these families have the highest rates of child poverty and suffer deep inequity in terms of opportunities. I suggest we can do more. I may table some amendments in that regard. Some of the things we might do are not simply around payments. They also involve addressing some of the blocks to accessing education and the unfortunate overlaps around payments, what qualifies and what does not. There is also the issue of maintenance, which has been highlighted in this House. Will the Minister address how she sees that issue progressing? I urge her to move forward on it early next year because it is a keen issue for myself and others on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection. We have been flagging it for a long time. The issue of a national maintenance body needs to examined.  One very small but practical measure that has been sought for decades is to look at availability for work on the basis of hours rather than days. Some who are parenting and particularly those who are parenting alone, may want the opportunity to work for a number of hours, for example from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. However, because one is required to be available full-time for a full day to receive certain payments, an obstacle is created for those who seek to build attachment to the workplace in different ways. Could that be reviewed? I may table amendments in that regard.  I note the family income supplement has been renamed as the working family payment. Again this is something the joint committee should consider. We need to examine whether it is just the same or whether there are differences. If it is going to be a key policy plank in the future, it may need a little bit more debate and scrutiny.As a simple measure regarding family income supplement, while the thresholds are of key importance, the requirement of 19 hours is a serious concern. I will speak on a simple, practical level to make it clear. Fifteen hours of child care are provided to people in Ireland. If somebody is working in the child care sector or is relying on that child care to allow them to access work, he or she is tied to 15 hours. Such people will never reach the 19 hours that would allow them to access the family income supplement or working family payment. This is a gap into which people fall and it affects opportunities. I want to highlight other activation concerns. Since long before I came into this House, I have called for a rural pilot for the European Youth Guarantee. I want to put it on the Minister's agenda and I will probably put forward a suggestion for a report in this area. We undertook the European Youth Guarantee, which had strong lessons for us on the problem of youth unemployment in urban areas. However, there are areas with very high rural youth unemployment, in the south east of the country for example. A pilot scheme which would allow us to identify and tackle the issues facing young unemployed people in rural Ireland might be something to consider.  My other serious concerns about our activation policies pertain to the seemingly increasing focus on sanction and compulsion, as well as the question of whether people are being given options. The full understanding of activation was always that it was employment, training or education. My concern is that education has fallen by the wayside somewhat and is not getting the same emphasis. The Labour Market Council appeared before the Joint Committee on Social Protection last February and its representatives stated that while there had been a move towards a work-first policy, we needed to re-examine the option of an education-first policy. I am also very seriously concerned about the personal progression plans and I will be putting forward amendments in this regard. Due to the way they are being managed at present by Turas Nua and Seetec under contract from the Department, there are serious data breaches. I am concerned with what people are required to sign in order to show they are co-operating. People who wish to co-operate with employment and activation services are being asked to sign a document that is not appropriate and which breaches privacy, particularly around contact with their future employer. That is a serious concern.  The other question relates to voluntary access to schemes for those who are qualified adults and are not on the live register. I may table amendments on this but I am happy to work with the Minister on it. There are people who would like to access employment and activation supports but are concerned because they may not be available full-time or suitable for the live register. As we are losing that huge potential, I would like us to review that issue.  My last point relates to a key issue and I will table extensive amendments on it. There has been a kind of plough-forward attitude within the Department but I urge the Minister to really review this seriously. The public service card is a serious concern. The way that it is being rolled out has constantly raised concerns, including those of the Data Protection Commissioner. Until the Data Protection Commissioner's concerns are satisfied and we can be genuinely assured that we are meeting the standards of the EU general data protection regulation, GDPR, that is coming in next year, there are very serious concerns. It is not just the individual cases that are constantly arising but my concern relates to the manner of its introduction. It needs examination and I will urge that we pull back from making the public service card the only acceptable form of identification for claiming social protection payments while these concerns are being addressed. That is very important, and it would be appropriate and circumspect for the Department to act in that way. My last points are wider points. I will address everything else through amendments on Committee Stage, and of course I am always just as happy to work with the Department if any of these issues can be progressed without an amendment. I acknowledge that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, did accept some of my proposals, and introduced them by ministerial order rather than amendment in this debate last year. In respect of preparation for Ireland's ratification of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, does the Minister have the scope to introduce new measures mid-year if needed? Furthermore, in the Minister's review, I urge her to examine the private pension tax reliefs in Ireland, which amount to figures between €210 million and €2 billion. This is part of the financing package and it must be part of the consideration. I will put forward amendments unless the Minister can indicate that this is already in the picture. I understand that the Minister is constrained in addressing the pension issue right now. Will she commit that, if possible, she will put forward proposals as amendments to the social welfare and pensions Bill when it comes through in the spring?

I will start with Senator Higgins and work backwards, if that is all right. I thank the Senators for the valuable contributions that have been made today. In response to Senator Higgins, I thank her for her support, not just for this Bill, but also in general. I know she knows where I am trying to get to and I appreciate it. I will look at the requirements for hours versus days. I will not do it within the confines of this particular Bill, because that concern does not actually relate to it. However, it might be worthwhile, because the people the Senator is talking about are not small in their numbers. I was not focused enough, or conscious enough of the difference between 19 hours and 15 hours with regard to the family income supplement but that will form part of our review of the working family payments. The whole purpose of the Department is involved here. It is not my money or our money, it is your money. It is the people's money. The reason we do what we do is to make people's lives different; not just some people's lives, but all citizens' lives. We do not set out with an ideology that we will look after certain groups of people. The only reason the Department exists is to look after people during times of their lives when they cannot look after themselves. There has to be a minimum standard and that is where we are going to. However, I acknowledge that all Members recognise that the minimum standard does have limitations because if we did not have limits, I would have everything much higher than it is. We do have limits and we have to work around those limits. I will come back to Senator Higgins on the question of hours versus days. I ask her to give me a couple of months. Between now and next week I will find out how long I will need, and maybe I will come back to her before next week and let her know. We are looking at changes in the European Youth Guarantee Fund with regard to some of our youths, who are removed from the marketplace for a variety of reasons. There are not just one or two reasons, there are many reasons. As some people in rural Ireland may be affected differently than those in urban areas, let us have a look at that.  I refer to people who are unemployed for a small or a medium amount of time. The whole reason that activation is there is because we activate them either through training, re-training, change of skills or education. There is not one exclusive path of just putting somebody on a scheme to give him or her work experience. If suitable education and third level education is more suited to that particular person, there is no reason not to do it. I came across a barrier with some schemes, as I am sure the Senator did, whereby there is only a certain amount of courses one can go on. Who decided that someone cannot be a physicist just because he or she has a child under the age of seven? I am going to examine those. There should be no barriers and I believe there should be no pre-conditioned courses. We should not say that someone can only be A, B or C. They should have the flair and the imagination to be able to follow whatever course they want to, and particularly to be able to aim higher during those seven years. That particular scheme obviously has conditions but there should be no limits to anybody with regard to educational resources and support from my Department or from the Department of Education and Skills. On the topic of voluntary access to schemes, I did not think we deprived people of that access but I will have a look. There is a new plan for jobless households, for people who are qualified adults and do not appear on any register anywhere. Perhaps they are precluded from going on to community employment, CE, schemes, Tús or into JobPath. I will have a look at that. If they are, they should not be. I will see how we can fix it, but if we can fix it and if what the Senator has said is true, of which I have no doubt, that might put pressure on the already over-burdened CE scheme. They are nearly at capacity. Some people will tell one that they cannot fill places because of particular reasons but there are waiting lists and over-capacity on other schemes. That will form part of the review that we are doing between now and the new year. The UN disability rights convention was mentioned. We are going to sign it. The Minister of State got approval at Cabinet on Tuesday. Whatever we need to do to make sure that we conform to that charter is what we are going to do. That is why the public consultation is going to take place in the beginning of the new year with regard to the deprivation of liberty. However, if other legislation needs to be passed to enhance the rights of people with disabilities, either in the workplace or to allow them access other supports, it is our job to ensure that we pass it. Specifically, it is an issue for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but I will give him whatever support he needs. To allay some of the fears expressed by the Senator, the Data Protection Commissioner did have some concerns. The commissioner asked a very large number of questions of us - 49 in total - in the context of allaying those concerns. We have answered all of the questions comprehensively and we are awaiting a response from the commissioner's office as to whether it is either happy or not happy with our replies regarding the practices. If it is not happy, we will deal with that at the time. This is not my baby, so to speak - it started ten years ago - but I do not want anybody believing that there is a problem with the data we are holding. If there are concerns, we have to address them and we will make sure we do so. If the Data Protection Commissioner comes back to us with concerns, I will come back to the House, or to the joint committee in order to discuss them. I am happy to be able to answer the question regarding tax relief on pensions because it is €2.6 billion every year. That is a phenomenal amount of money. After Christmas, we will be engaging in public consultation on the new auto-enrolment pension scheme we are proposing to roll out. The parameters of that scheme will be very much determined by the responses we get from the public consultation. In that context, the Senator should not wait for somebody else to make a submission. There is a view that we should have a lower limit and an upper limit. To my mind, those limits might be €20,000 and €65,000, but the position in that regard will be determined by the public consultation; it will not be determined by me. The €2.6 billion will be going into that pot. That is what I think. Obviously, what Senators think will be very much shaped by what will be the auto-enrolment policy. I hope that the public consultation will be carried out in the first three or four months of next year. We will then come back to committee to discuss the new auto-enrolment policy because I want to roll it out from the beginning of the year after next, and we need space to be able to consult the public insurance bodies and those in the private sector. In addition, the Department will need time to create an IT platform that will be able to manage it. This is not something that can be done in a couple of months, but we can agree the parameters in the first couple of months of next year. The Senator should hold her whisht and come back to me at the beginning of next year. I thank Senator Ardagh for her support. I appreciate that she will probably table additional amendments next week and I am very happy to discuss them. I thank Senator Boyhan for his lovely comments, which are not directed at me because I do not do any of the work. The people in our Department are genuinely some of the most talented and committed individuals I have ever come across. I do not say that lightly but they are that. I know I am a fusspot and I sign all my own letters but that is only because I cannot have somebody else sign letters for me. I thank the Senator for that particular compliment. Senator Boyhan specifically mentioned the increase in the farm assist payment. There was also an increase in the number of placements on the farm assist programme this year. It is probably our most successful scheme because it is got a 99% application rate whereas many of our other schemes would have a participation rate of less than 99%. I acknowledge Senator Colm Burke's contribution. I am very glad he acknowledged that the only reason we have had money to give over the past two years - and I would love to take the credit for the payments that are being given - is because the economy is generating it. If the economy was not in a place where we could generate money, we might have seen a return to what were awful years between 2009 and 2015 when cuts of up to €4 billion were made. We all have our differences in terms of the reason the economy is recovering - and it is recovering better in some places than others - but all I know is that it affords me the ability to give people who have to rely on fixed incomes on a weekly basis a few bob extra. It is not as much as I would like to be able to give. I would love to be able to give more. I hope that as the economy continues to recover next year, we will be able to do the reinstatement of the disregard for lone parents because they are among the hardest working people in this country. If I do nothing else for whatever length of time I am Minister in this Department, I will break that stereotypical image that some people have of women in the main who are rearing families on their own because it is wrong. We need to work together, continuously and collaboratively, in order to ensure that we break that stereotypical image because they are some of the most hard-working people. When I was at home I came to work for a rest because it a very hard job to be at home with one's children. Most of the women, and men, who are rearing families are actually working so they are only getting to keep more of their own money. I want to continue to do that. I acknowledge what Senator Colm Burke said to the effect that caring is something we need to examine. I stick my nose into many areas that are not my business but our Department provides income supports. It is not my responsibility to devise the carers' strategy but I will make whatever input I can in respect of the Department of Health. That conversation has started and been regenerated based on the "Prime Time" programme this week, which was exceptionally difficult to watch. Mark Fitzpatrick is a good pal of mine from our DCA Warriors days, so I will do whatever I can to recognise, reward and assist those people, many of whom are not getting carer's allowance or carer's benefit. Many of them are doing that work for nothing because their husband or wife is earning so much money they would not fall within the means test to be able to receive carer's allowance. However, we need to recognise that 6 billion hours of care are being given on a weekly basis by those people who are staying at home and providing those services in the absence of any other State intervention. We need to have a serious conversation about that and it might be worthwhile for the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Joint Committee on Health examining that in the future. I thank Senator Warfield for his support for the good items in the Bill. I acknowledge that if we had more money, he would be supportive because we would be providing larger increases. All I can say is that if and when the economy recovers and as long as I am here, I will make sure that a sizeable chunk of the money that is available to spend will be spent in my Department. I know that probably irks other people, some within my own party and some outside it, but for as long as I am here, I will always recognise that it is very difficult to live on a fixed income. It is very difficult for people who have no recourse other than that income. They do not have the ability to go out and work for ten or 20 hours to supplement their income. As long as I can increase those people's living standards, I will do so. However, people have to recognise that there are some major shifts in policy that we could do if we did not have to give everybody of a working age an increase every year. To that end, it might be a valuable exercise to have a body examine social welfare increases along the lines of what is done in the Low Pay Commission and to take the politics out of it so that I would have more money to increase the qualified child payment. I would have increased it by €10 this year if I had the money, but €2 was the most I could do. When we look at fuel poverty, I only got one week this year. I would love to bring that back up to where we were before the cuts were made. When we talk about the family income supplement, the position regarding the 19 hours needs to be addressed. When we look at the hours versus days, it would be wonderful to be able to do that but all of those shifts in policies, which I know would be welcomed by all the Senators, do not come cheap. As long as we have to keep giving €5 to every scheme every year, that will take off €350 million, which does not leave much left to try to address real policy changes. I hope the Senators can read between the lines in the context of what I am saying. There is nobody who is not deserving of any small increase we can give every year but because there are so many people reliant on the payments they get from our Department, even a small increase adds up to tens of millions of euro very quickly. I thank the Senators for their support. We will have exchanges next week and whatever I can do I will do. It is not a case of not accepting amendments just because I am not a nice person. If we can take amendments and I can do reports on them, I will be very happy to talk to the Senators and to do them. Ultimately, I want to have proper data so that I can use it next year when I am fighting for more money. If the Senators can help me do that, it will be welcome. I commend the Bill to the House.
