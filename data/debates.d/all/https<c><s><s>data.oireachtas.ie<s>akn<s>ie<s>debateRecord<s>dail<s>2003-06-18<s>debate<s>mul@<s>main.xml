          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Government has demonstrated in recent times that it cannot be trusted on a number of issues. It appears incapable of making a decision without having a consultant on hand. Two reports on the health services, Report No. 119 and Report No. 120, will be published today. This country needs greater capacity in terms of beds, consultants, nurses and therapists. What will we get from the Government on a day when a major Dublin hospital has revealed that it may have to treat its patients in the car park and when Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin has fewer beds than when it opened 50 years ago? We will get a glossy presentation outside the House which will distract from the lack of essential capacity in the system. The people will not be fooled a second time. The Government failed to deliver on a range of promises in this area over the past 12 months. Will the Taoiseach tell us this morning that the announcement later today will mean the Mater Hospital will not have to treat patients in the car park and that it will achieve more bed capacity in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin? How will it affect our Special Olympians, of whom we are proud, who will lose support and services later in the year?</p>

          <p eId="para_2">Today is an important day for the health service. We are trying to ensure that we can do more for our patients, that we can get better value for the money we put into our health service and that we have a better and more accountable management system. Much work has been done over the past two years on the health strategy. Groups of national and international consultants have been involved, together with people in the day to day service and people from the health boards and the hospitals who have taken a direct interest in health matters. There have been sub-groups of all the professionals and several hundred people have worked for the past two years to bring forward a blueprint to update our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">We have not changed any of our structures since the early 1970s, which is 33 years ago, but we have resourced the health service. In 1997 I stated that we needed more resources in the health services and that we needed to spend considerably more money, and we have done that. The overall increase since I took office has been 162% or €5.7 billion, which is a lot of money. There is now 96,000 staff compared to 68,000, which is a 30% increase. There has been a 26% increase in the number of consultants and a 19% increase in the number of nurses. There are 58% more people in nursing training. Two thirds of the administrative staff are involved in front-line patient services.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_24">Today is also about the protection of the politics of sham of a Government which has lost control and lost touch with reality. How does closing 500 beds or leaving Mullingar hospital empty for the past seven years represent efficiency and reform? Why is it that a political decision made to allocate 200,000 extra medical cards has resulted in not one being issued? Why is it that, while the Minister for Health and Children opened an eight bed unit in Beaumont Hospital last week, four beds are closed because of cutbacks? This is a protection of the politics of sham, the politics of promise and the litany of broken commitments around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">This party has no problem with real reform but the Government is confusing administrative change with real reform. The people will still face waiting lists and difficulties in hospital as a result of this. At the end of the glossy production and hype, what will the people have delivered to them? Not a single extra bed, not a single nurse, not one single extra medical card.</p>

I ask the Taoiseach to put today's announcement in the context of what it will do for patients. How will it improve patient care? There is no point telling us to read the report as we are the only ones who have not got it. How many of the 500 beds that have been closed will be reopened? How many new beds will be provided as a result of today's announcement?</p>
          <p eId="para_48">How will it affect the Mater Hospital in his constituency, which I visited last week? How will it affect its plan to cater for emergency patients and ambulances in the car park? How will it improve the environment in which quality caring  staff are functioning in impossible circumstances in the accident and emergency department of the hospital? How will it affect the care of children in Crumlin hospital where the provision now is less than when the hospital opened in the 1950s? I ask the Taoiseach to address the practical question of what this will do for patient care.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">He proposes to save €1 million on the expenses of those who attend health board meetings, who comprise more than local politicians, and that is very good. The Minister for Finance, in a stroke for a constituent in the Finance Act, has cost the Exchequer €63 million potentially, according to the Department of Finance. This Minister for ideas when there is a full moon, the Minister for Education and Science, will cost the taxpayer €45 million to introduce electronic voting.

They have outlined where we need to make fundamental reform to achieve better management and care so that we can use the resources we are providing and will continue to provide. This year, a difficult year, there has been a 12% increase in funding, almost €1 billion. All the taxpayers' money we collect goes into our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Everything we do is designed to make the system more efficient so that the throughput of patients will be dealt with better and the operating theatres and ancillary facilities will be better. We are putting €2.5 billion into the capital programme under the national development plan. Spending next year will exceed €10 billion and will equate to several thousand euro for every individual in the country. We must make sure the services in Donegal and Kerry are as good as the services in Dublin. We must make sure there are equal resources. There is no point in having six  consultants for one specialty in Dublin with none in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">We must make sure there is a national examination. The Hanly report will deal with staffing, the Brennan report deals with finances and the Prospectus report deals with structures. Several steering groups and sub-groups have interacted and worked closely together on all three reports over the past two years to try to bring forward a blueprint that will make our health system better.</p>

It took us several years in the 1970s to build a service but it is in the interest of everyone who requires a service and pays for it that we try to get this right. I hope we can seriously deal with this issue and I thank the House for listening to me for two minutes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_59">The Taoiseach is making a nonsense of straightforward questions put to him here morning after morning. How can we talk about the Hanly report when the Tánaiste claimed during a debate last night that the Minister for Health and Children had not seen it? The only reports we have are an accountant's report, produced by the Department of Finance, which is important in itself presumably, and the report on structures. We do not have the key report on medical personnel, the consultants and nurses who work at the coalface. The Tánaiste said last night the Minister for Health and Children will conceal the report in the Department until the House has risen. The Taoiseach then gets up and, doe-eyed, tells the Ceann Comhairle that the Government is providing 3,000 extra beds. The 3,000 extra beds in the health strategy, according to his calculations, will cost €7.7 billion over ten years. The Government has provided €7 million so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The problem in the health service is the two tier system. What will this report do for access? What will it do for equity? What will it do for accountability? What will it do for value for money? Above all, what will it do for the patient? What will it do when the major acute hospital in the Taoiseach's constituency is making provision to treat emergency patients in the car park and sick children are less provided for in Crumlin than they were 50 years ago?</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Is the Taoiseach aware  of the growing number of women who are now coming forward and are survivors of a barbaric practice carried out in Irish hospitals between the 1950s and the early 1980s? This procedure, known as symphysiotomy, was inflicted on 343 women at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. This is not the first time I have referred to what I can only describe as the mutilation of women who presented at that hospital in previous years. This practice was also carried out at the National Maternity and the Coombe Hospitals in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">My words are grossly inadequate to describe the pain and suffering these women have gone through and continue to go through. Their pelvises were sawn through, either immediately prior to or, in some cases, after the birth of their child.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Is the Taoiseach aware that this procedure was carried out, ostensibly because in these hospitals a strict Catholic ethos operated under the view that women should go through this procedure rather than have caesarean sections? The notion behind that thinking was that women, following caesarean sections would, God forbid, look at procedures of birth control or the option of sterilisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">These women are calling for a full public inquiry into their suffering.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">The Minister for Health and Children tells me he has requested and, I think, received a report from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and he hopes to bring forward his conclusions arising from that. The chief medical officer of the Department has been working on this since April 2001. He is dealing with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The institute has advised that excellent results were claimed for the procedure at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate, due to sepsis. The institute says that, in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. However, from the 1950s onwards the operation for blood poisoning and obstructed labour was gradually replaced by modern caesarean sections. Enormous medical advances have been made over the last 50 years. I am advised that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in light of current knowledge and experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The Minister has to deal with the report, which he has received. The chief medical officer will have to come forward with his views. The Minister has just told me he is prepared to convey the  contents and some of the aspects of the report to the Deputy, who is obviously interested in the matter.</p>

The idea that we should not be asking questions about procedures employed in previous years, decades or whatever is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Health and Children to respond positively to the appeal of these women? Will he acknowledge their pain and suffering and undertake to provide the necessary resources? Will he not depend on the obstetricians and gynaecologists who will have a particular view, but recognise that they do not have a monopoly of wisdom regarding the correctness of these procedures or other such interventions imposed on women, invariably against their will and in cases where many of them did not know what was happening?

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_81">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_123">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 26, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I would like to congratulate David Trimble on his achievement in winning the vote at the Ulster Unionist Council meeting on Monday and I look forward to continuing to work with him and his colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party and all of the pro-Agreement parties, to ensure that all of the commitments and undertakings in the Agreement are fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Prime Minister Blair and I have made it clear following our meeting in Dublin on 6 May that the joint declaration is the route map for implementation of the Agreement and is the shared agenda for both Governments. We will continue to work closely together and with the parties on all those areas where it is possible to do so. It is very clear that we can continue to move forward on a number of important areas including policing, criminal justice, rights and equality and there is a joint commitment by the two Governments to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I met with the president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, and Martin McGuinness on 24 May. We have also had continuing contacts with the SDLP leader, Mark Durkan, and his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I met with David Ford, leader of the Alliance Party and his colleagues on 28 May and both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I met with Ambassador Richard Haass on 21 May. These discussions have focused on how we can best take matters forward and generate momentum in the political process again. I expect to have ongoing contacts with the parties over the coming period.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I welcome the announcement that Richard Haass will remain as President Bush's special envoy to Northern Ireland, continuing the work which he has been doing. He has already made a valuable contribution and I look forward to working closely with him and the US Administration as we seek to make progress. It is important that we have continuity at this time and I am extremely grateful for the ongoing commitment of President Bush and his Administration to the process. I would also like to wish Ambassador Haass well in his new role as President of the Council on Foreign Relations. I have no immediate plans to meet with President Bush.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Contacts between the two Governments are ongoing and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, attended the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 20 May. Both Governments will liaise closely in the period ahead and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are meeting again today. The conference will meet again shortly to review progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I will meet with Prime Minister Blair in the margins of the European Council meeting in  Thessalonika later this week when we will review the situation generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">At the initiative of Archbishop Robin Eames, I met with members of the Loyalist Commission on 11 June. We had a useful exchange of views. I believe it is important to build relations with unionism and loyalism and this meeting was part of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Despite the difficulties, we have a real opportunity to build a peaceful future in Northern Ireland and loyalists and republicans have an important role to play in ensuring that we have a peaceful summer and a calm marching season.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton:</from>
          <p eId="para_133">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does the Taoiseach fear that in the aftermath of the recent vote in the Ulster Unionist Party there is a danger of further loss of momentum, in that it is reported that some of those who failed on this occasion believe they still have an arm-lock, to use their own words, on Mr. Trimble and the capacity for him to make progress? Does the Taoiseach have in mind, either through his discussions with Mr. Adams or Mr. Haass, or indeed with the British, any initiatives that might start to fill what is a dangerous vacuum, which appears to be emerging at present, during which little or nothing is being done on decommissioning issues and where there is a sense of loss of progress, and does he feel that there is scope for some of the players to now kick-start a move that could result in mutual reinforcing moves from different parts of the community?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_83">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_134">I agree with Deputy Richard Bruton that it is a difficult period and there are dangers. All of my experience, like that of everybody else who has dealt with the Northern Ireland brief over the years, is that whenever there is a political vacuum, it is dangerous. We saw that at the weekend and, frankly, we were lucky at the weekend. I thank the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The two bombs were very large and good work by both police services prevented them from exploding and creating a difficult situation. The bomb in Derry contained 1,200 lb. of explosives so one can see that there are people around who would be very glad to use the vacuum to create difficulties and equally, with the bomb south of the Border, people were obviously up to activities that were designed to make the Unionist Party conference at the weekend even more difficult that it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Therefore I agree that this is a difficult period. On the issue of where we go and our plan, "Yes" is the answer to the Deputy's question. We have a very strong view. Our view is that we must take all of the aspects we can in the Joint Declaration and move as quickly as possible on their implementation. Therefore, everything that was not directly linked to what we were trying to do some weeks ago should be moved forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">In the discussions that I mentioned in the reply between Deputy Cowen, Deputy McDowell and Deputy Kitt, and the meetings that I have had,  we have taken all the aspects in the Joint Declaration that we believe can be implemented and we have outlined to the British Government how we think that should be done and we will continue to press – in the meeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will have today and in my meeting with Prime Minister Blair on Friday – for implementation. We believe that if we keep on doing this, we will create a momentum and can continue to get action, particularly during the marching season.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">On the difficulty on political progress, we must do as much as we can over the next fortnight because from the first week in July until the end of August, it becomes extremely difficult to make political progress, whether the year is a good or bad one. We will continue to try, but people do not make themselves available and the system in the North becomes quite difficult for a long period until after the marches on 12 August. Almost 3,000 marches will take place during that period. That is why the meeting is taking place today.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">We have had a great deal of contact with Ambassador Haass who has been talking to the British Government. We have put forward our views at those meetings to which I referred. Our whole effort now is to try to get implementation on as much of the Joint Declaration as we can over the next few weeks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton:</from>
          <p eId="para_139">I wish the Taoiseach success in those initiatives. On the timing of the Assembly elections specifically, has he, through his discussions with the British Government, a clearer view of when those elections may occur or is that picture beginning to become clear?</p>
          <p eId="para_140">As the Taoiseach stated, we are at the start of the marching session and in recent days he has had meetings both with the Loyalist Commission and the leader of Sinn Féin. Following those meetings, does the Taoiseach feel that there is a meeting of minds or a willingness to step back from unnecessary conflict during this marching season and did he receive any assurances from any of the groups involved that a positive approach would be adopted to what is always an extraordinarily difficult time for both communities?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_85">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_141">On the elections, I am very clear in my mind, but I am not sure we have a clear position agreed by all of the parties. The failure to hold elections a month ago was a bad mistake and failure to hold them in autumn would be a desperate mistake. I have said this to everybody so I am not saying it here for the first time, and I have outlined all my reasons for that. I simply do not believe one can withstand a vacuum and keep the political momentum without an Assembly and an Executive, without full-time politicians being at their place of work, and without the North-South bodies working or functioning properly, even though they are still existing on a care and management basis. I believe  people will lose faith and confidence in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The fact is that the Executive, for all its problems, had a high TAM rating with the public as a parliamentary assembly and the people had become accustomed to the system and dealing with it on issues through various pressure groups, interest groups and so on. To drift it out into any kind of lengthy period creates an enormous vacuum and makes that vacuum worse. If we do not have the elections in the early autumn, we will head into winter and spring and back into the summer, and God knows what will be the position then.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I repeat that view again today, and I will repeat it again to the British Prime Minister. Frankly, I cannot see how we could work through that period. This is probably the last chance for Northern Ireland questions in this session. At present, I have my hand in a whole lot of dykes, trying to keep people together. One would not be able to do that over a sustained period. We have endless meetings, with everybody everywhere just trying to keep the process going, and the answer is to have elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The Deputy asked whether there is any light at the end of the tunnel. I hope to meet David Trimble on the other side of a successful election. Much depends on him. Whether he uses his admittedly narrow victory to move on and to try to make progress or whether the elements in his party, which are clearly divided, continue to hold it back is a question I cannot answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">My wish is obvious. We are ready to work with David Trimble and with the pro-Agreement side to do all we can and, as they say in Northern Ireland, to stretch all we can, to help with as many issues as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Others are also prepared to do that. People were helpful in the past week. Sinn Féin and others were helpful on issues over the past week or two in the lead up to this conference. We have been through this many times. There have been 11 meetings of this kind. The question is what happens after the meetings and whether there is a progression. I hope that will be the decision and if not it will be a difficult summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">To answer the Deputy's question about the marching season, I have spoken to republicans and loyalists. I met members of the UDA, UVF and Red Hand Commandos for the first time. It is difficult to make a judgment but they seem sincere in their desire to have a quieter season. We need to work a little harder to build up more confidence and more contact between the people on the ground on both sides of the divide. There is no point in denying that a divide exists. More contact on the ground would help and I appreciate that people are working hard to achieve that. Without them we would not get through the marching season. From what I am told, I believe they are prepared to make an effort to give the political process a chance. It would be a help to know the date of the election but that may not  be possible in the short term. It will be a difficult few months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_148">I agree with the Taoiseach in his commendation of the work of An Garda Síochána in dealing with dissident elements in the republican movement and the splinter and break-away groups. The Garda appear to have done a splendid job and undoubtedly lives have been saved and people have been saved from injury and maiming. I include the PSNI in those remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Taoiseach expressed his preference on the question of elections and I agree with his view. Has he had any indication from the British authorities of their latest thinking? It is not apparent to those of us on the outside that it is an immediate pre-occupation of the British Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">With reference to Deputy Richard Bruton's question about Mr. Trimble and his recent survival in terms of the internal politics of the Ulster Unionist Party, is the Taoiseach still of the opinion that Mr. Trimble is the best prospect for the revival of the institutions and those who support the Agreement ought logically then, to do everything to support Mr. Trimble's position, notwithstanding the frustrations that people may have about his unpredictability or about the lack of vigour with which he has sold the Agreement to his own constituency?</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Will the Taoiseach agree that it is a matter of concern that the small majority in the Unionist community for the Agreement at the time of the referendum appears to have been ebbing away and the main cause seems to be the tardiness of the republican movement in complying with the full terms of the Agreement, specifically decommissioning? Will he agree that it is in the interests of the republican movement that Mr. Trimble's position should not be further undermined? Is he of the opinion that in his most recent survival within his party, Mr. Trimble has paid a price in terms of pushing ahead with the Agreement or does the Taoiseach believe he has faced down the anti-Agreement elements within the party?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_152">I am delighted that David Trimble and his colleagues prevailed because the anti-Agreement group within his party have a straightforward policy. I admire them for being straight about it but I disagree with them. Their policy is that they want an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party and they subscribe to the agenda that the Good Friday Agreement should be re-negotiated. My view is that the Good Friday Agreement cannot be re-negotiated because the people voted for it. In the words of many of the parties in Northern Ireland, there was never an agreement in Northern Ireland that was so dissected and analysed prior to the vote of the people. The majority voted for it and there was constitutional change involved. There is no provision for a review of the Agreement. Those who oppose David Trimble cannot have their way. Despite the difficulties that arise from time  to time, David Trimble still offers the best opportunity to move forward. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that all of us – and I include myself because I have a role to play in helping him – and republicans and Sinn Féin also have an interest because otherwise difficulties can be created for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I hope David Trimble will join with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and I and the other pro-Agreement parties because it is important that we all work together. There are some concerns about aspects of the Joint Declaration. Any agreement has different parties to it and this comes as a package. My view which is shared by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is that the Agreement cannot be cherry-picked. We must implement it as it is. There are many aspects that can be implemented and we should implement them. It would be very helpful to everyone in Northern Ireland and we should proceed with implementation. We must try to do that and get goodwill and deal with some of the issues that were outstanding. We will have to deal with them in a different way now that there is a different context. We have brought issues a long way in recent months and we must try to put them together in terms of the Joint Declaration and see what can be achieved. If we can progress with implementation of the Agreement and the Joint Declaration then we equally must have elections soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Deputy Rabbitte asked me a direct question whether I thought the British Government had finalised its views on that. My answer is "no". At today's meeting we will give our analysis again. We have been doing that for the past four weeks and I will do so again to lead into the meeting which I will have with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on Friday. I hope we are winning the argument that the vacuum will not be cured by delay. The elections were delayed for a month and then for three months but we did not agree a date. Another delay will put them into next year. The institutions collapsed in the early winter so that would mean a period of 18 months and that carries far too much risk. The meetings today, Friday and next week will be an opportunity to convince the British Government. I hope there will be agreement on early implementation of those aspects of the Joint Declaration which are clear – we have set out those that are clear – and that there will be progress on a date for the election. We will argue that the election should be held in early autumn at the latest.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Has the Taoiseach had any further reports from the British authorities about the Stakeknife affair? Has he raised with the British authorities reports that British agents within the IRA have been carrying out criminal activities within this jurisdiction?</p>

          <p eId="para_156">We have raised the issues centred around Stakeknife and the other issues the Deputy has mentioned. There are a number of issues. It would not be of much benefit to share  the information I have with the House. It is not very clear information. Whatever is the position, we have reached a satisfactory conclusion. It is another matter as to whether I will be given any further information this weekend. It would only create more confusion rather than be of assistance if I divulged the information I have been given to date so the answer to the Deputy's question is "no".</p>

          <p eId="para_158">Yes, and I assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue the general aspects, which are important. We definitely need to learn the full details of any involvement in criminal acts in this jurisdiction.

          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_159">All Deputies look for a coherent reply, but we are sometimes disappointed. I ask the Taoiseach to convey to the Garda Síochána and the PSNI my party's appreciation of the interception of the 1,200lb bomb. It was an important operation, as we do not want the shiver of fear and terror felt by people when they heard about the prospect of a 1,200lb bomb to be repeated. The efforts to find an agreement during the summer have been mentioned, but I ask the Taoiseach to appreciate that we are not in advance of the marching season, as it has already begun. A letter in today's <i>Irish News</i> mentioned that roads in the Magherafelt district were closed for four hours. Given the necessity of elections in the autumn, I ask the Taoiseach not to park any search for an agreement because of the marching season.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The issue of collusion is not mentioned in the joint declaration. Following his meeting with loyalists, is the Taoiseach any clearer about whether collusion between the British Government and loyalist paramilitaries is at an end? Given that we will soon have more inquiries than health boards, is there a need to reconsider the prospect of a truth and reconciliation commission, as the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday? Will the Taoiseach take into account the comments of the new president of the Methodist Church, the Rev. Jim Rea, who said that trust is needed to move the process forward? In that regard, I welcome the Taoiseach's meeting with the Loyalist Commission. Can he suggest ways in which Opposition Members or other members of the community can help to build trust?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_93">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_161">We can all help to build trust and confidence by making contact and engaging in dialogue. I am certain that the efforts of the republican and loyalist communities and the contacts being made between various groups and organisations are helpful. The issues of collusion and what happened in the past were not discussed  to any great extent, obviously, in my meeting with the Loyalist Commission. These matters are being actively reviewed by Mr. Justice Cory. I referred yesterday to the recent statements of certain loyalists about the Rosemary Nelson case, which relates to more recent times. These issues are worrying, but we hope that the new policing arrangements under the new Chief Constable, as well as the new boards and structures, are working well, that progress is being made and that that development will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">There are concerns about the reform mechanisms. The oversight commissioner, Tom Constantine, is examining these issues. Perhaps it may be an exaggeration to state that the continuing reforms are already 100% perfect, but it is true to say that leaders are trying extremely hard. The efforts of the oversight commissioner, the ombudsperson and others are aimed at ensuring that policing in Northern Ireland is fair and equitable. It is certain that people are trying. It is hard to answer for every last person in any organisation, but it is clear from the many efforts and reports I see that people are trying very hard – it is only fair that I acknowledge that. We have to ensure that we try to uncover other tensions or instances of malpractice that may have existed in the past and may be lingering in the system. The leaders are assisting this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The marching season, which never seems to stop and with which we have had to live in recent years, starts on Drumcree Sunday and ends in late August. I wish it were not such a defined season as the level of tension seems to change. I have learned to understand that people with whom I deal all year seem to visibly change during the season. It is important that we understand that there are huge tensions, which are very real for people living in certain areas. The summer might be a nice time of year for some people, but it is not very nice for people living in certain areas. We have to understand that, and I understand it. People are committed and are genuinely putting in a great deal of effort to ensure that tensions are eased during the marching season. We all know, however, that this process is not easy to control in interface areas as an incident can happen that makes matters difficult. I have received commitments from people who are prepared to do all they can. I met the Loyalist Commission on that basis, to emphasise that we are genuinely trying. I said that I am convinced that people on the republican and Nationalist sides are trying hard and I stressed that it would be appreciated if the loyalist side could try equally hard. That was my understanding.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I welcome the Taoiseach's earlier statement that a deferral of elections beyond the autumn would be a desperate mistake. We all recognise that. I would like to ask the Taoiseach about his contacts with the British Prime Minister since the special debate in this House on 28 May. The House unanimously  expressed its support for the phrase in the Government's motion which stated that "elections should take place quickly and, regardless of any other considerations, no later than the autumn". How forcefully has the Taoiseach conveyed the unanimous view of the House to the British Prime Minister? This is a critical matter, regardless of any other considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Does the Taoiseach agree that the election should proceed irrespective of what is happening inside or outside the Ulster Unionist Party? Does he agree that the defining moment of the UUP's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the working of the Good Friday Agreement was not reached at last Monday night's meeting, but was reached in last September's compromise motion, agreed between David Trimble and Jeffrey Donaldson? I agree with those who described the motion quite accurately as an exit strategy, to all intents and purposes. These are the concerns of many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I have listened carefully to the Taoiseach's responses. Can he offer us a further indication of the British Prime Minister's intent? The Taoiseach has indicated that he has not noted sufficient clarity or a conclusion to the British Prime Minister's deliberations on a recall date for the Assembly elections. Can the Taoiseach give us an insight into his expectations in that regard? Does he feel that Mr. Blair will reach the same conclusion he has reached, which is shared by the overwhelming mass of elected opinion on this island?</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I wish to ask, finally, about the British Prime Minister's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the so-called intelligence services in Britain and their operation in Ireland. There is major concern that the British Prime Minister's position regarding the UK secret service has been compromised by his acceptance of wildly exaggerated claims from that source in relation to the war in Iraq. There is real concern that Mr. Blair is now stretched – to use a word the Taoiseach used earlier – or compromised by that relationship.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_170">The questions touch on different aspects of the matter. In reply to the last one, I think the British Prime Minister is genuinely helpful on all issues to do with intelligence, in so far as the people answering directly to him are concerned, whether it is the GOC service or his meetings with army officers or the new head of the PSNI. There is not a difficulty in that. He relays information to us. As I said previously, I am not as clear in regard to past issues such as  those relating to MI5 and to other matters, but I do not think there is any difficulty. I do not think there is a problem with our dealings on any of these issues with the British Prime Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me how hard we pressed in respect of the Assembly elections. We have been pressing the British Prime Minister since long before he postponed the elections for the first time, not to mind the second time. We went along with the first postponement because it was only for a month but we were reluctant even to do that at the time. We never stopped making our point of view. I have no doubt that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will make his views known forcibly today as he does so well, and as we have both done on a number of occasions recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">As I said, we are not yet in a position to do anything. It was necessary to wait for the outcome of the meeting on Monday night before we moved to the next step. That is why today's meeting was planned as well as my meeting for Friday. I hope we can now begin to make progress on these issues and try to get certainty on an election date.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Deputy Rabbitte made a point earlier, but if we were to do that, one of the concerns that the British Government would have, and that I would have, is that it is fine to hold Assembly elections but what does one move on to next? Let me be clear, when I said I am very anxious to have the election, I do not just want to have the election for the sake of it and then have nothing else happen. When we have the election I want to move on to the Assembly appointing a First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I want to see the cross-party operations work, the Executive set up as it was and for us to get back on track. I do not want to see an election and then a return to stalemate. Clearly, in order to do that we need Mr. Trimble. There is only one way to do that which is to try to get an agreement around the joint declaration. I hope that we do not open it up any further than that and try to move it on from where we were. I think that will be possible. I know the vote was tight the other night but a win is a win, a decision is a decision, and I presume in any democratic organisation people will respect that. I believe Mr. Trimble and his colleagues who supported him who are in the leadership of the UUP and who are pro-Agreement will subscribe to the joint declaration and that we will be able to make progress. I am not saying that it is going to be easy, it is not and never is. However, I hope we can try and move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">Would the Taoiseach not agree that, by any objective yardstick, the arrangements made in the Good Friday Agreement are now in tatters? There is no Executive, no devolved Government and no Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Is the Taoiseach aware that the polarisation between the communities is perhaps more entrenched now in the North than at any other time, even by comparison with the worst of times  over the course of the past 30 years? Is it not the case that the Good Friday Agreement institutionalised sectarian divisions? Having done so and frozen them in time and being based on parties that are themselves sectarian-based, could it be anything else? Is the postponement of the elections by the British Prime Minister, which was a totally undemocratic manoeuvre, not an admission of failure by him?</p>
          <p eId="para_176">What will be different in the autumn? Is it not the reality that there is no guarantee as to when the British Prime Minister or the British Government will order elections in Northern Ireland? Does the Taoiseach have any commitment that before this year is out, the elections will be held?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_177">I am merely repeating what I already said three times in answer to that question. I do not believe Deputy Higgins meant what he said at the outset but his language about the Good Friday Agreement being in tatters is the language of the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA. I know that is not what he meant. That is not the view of all the other pro-Agreement parties. Our view is that while there are certainly difficulties, we want to have the elections. I agree that it is a bad situation that we do not have Assembly elections or an Executive but all of the pro-Agreement parties are of the view that the joint declaration is a good document. While there are arguments about different elements of it, the document itself and the Good Friday Agreement are still implementable. We should keep it to that and try to minimise the tensions on all sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I agree with Deputy Higgins on the position in regard to the election. As I said, now that Monday night is over I hope we can move on with Mr. Trimble and the other parties to make progress with the joint declaration in order to get a date for the autumn. That is what we are now endeavouring to do but we do not yet have a commitment to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">I put it to the Taoiseach that it is time the Government and the forces involved did understand the position. What does he make of the situation on the ground? He has reports and has met people. Is he concerned about the extent of polarisation? Why did the Good Friday Agreement not come to grips with it? Is it not time for new thinking and a new approach in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_101">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_181">I accept what the Deputy said. I know that is not what he meant. I accept that polarisation exists. Over the past few weeks I have had a good insight into how people think on different sides, which is most interesting. We have to work to understand it and even though I disagree completely with many things that are said, one has to try to build up an element of under standing of people's positions in order to try to move it on.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Deputy Higgins is correct in that people have totally different concepts and objectives of how one can get to a centre position but the only way to do that is to try to take them from their communities and get them to share their views. Some people are of the opinion that we consider them planters and want to drive them out of Northern Ireland. This is a deeply held conviction, as is the belief that my only motivation is to take over the whole lot and to see them run off. We must work extremely hard, as many people are already doing across the spectrum – those in business, sporting organisations and community workers – to try to bring people together. We have to create an understanding that it is possible to co-operate and share things without threatening each other. That is what I mean by building up trust and confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There is not a person on this island who cannot contribute to trying to change people. If one is living in a particular community for a long time and has seen people killed, one gets a particular perspective. One may think the whole world is against one and that somebody is trying to take away everything that one believes in. That is how it is whether one is republican, Nationalist, loyalist or Unionist. We all have to try to understand that. The years of conflict have made many people on all sides bitter. While the Agreement exists, it is not possible to just move it on in a short period of time. A combined effort is now taking place, it is not just a case of both Governments working together. A great number of people are now working to try to improve this situation.</p>

The Government is proposing that this would go through without debate, having guillotined the debate yesterday on the substantive Bill with regard to the protection of the environment. As the House is aware, the role of local authority members is being removed and, in future, managers will decide on these charges – there will no longer be representation associated with the taxation involved. Now, it is proposed that the financial resolution to make this possible will be passed without debate in this House. This is not the right way to do our business and I cannot support it.</p>

The notion that this House cannot debate this matter  is unacceptable. Only last Friday, the Government Chief Whip suffered the embarrassment of being able to provide only 11 Deputies in the House, after she had been summoned from wherever she was. To propose to the House that we should now pass a major resolution of this nature without debate is unacceptable.

Is it now the intention of the Government to recall the Dáil to ensure that we have this debate? The Taoiseach referred this morning to the significance of the Hanly report, yet his intention is to withhold the report's publication until after the Dáil rises so that there can be no possibility of having a debate in the national Parliament on an issue of such importance.</p>

Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the imposition of the levy for the new radio and television programmes will extend to Sky Television and Mr. Rupert Murdoch's company?

          <p eId="para_336">Local authorities will play an important role in the promotion of the arts in the future. In ensuring a fair distribution of resources, local authorities will play an important role in achieving this. I have received a file of various submissions from local authority arts officers throughout the State all of which have one thing in common. This year funding by the Arts Council is reduced because of overall cutbacks and many of them receive little from their local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I outlined to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, on Committee Stage the circumstances in County Kerry where we have an active arts officer with an expansive programme but receiving little funding. With the Arts Council grant this year, under the arts plan, €12,000 was allocated while the number of applications was 100. The result was that most successful applicants got €100 each. I opened the exhibition for the Tralee Arts Group who got €100 while it has 40 artists. The art plans in local authorities are underfunded and underresourced. Arts officers throughout the State have their programmes curtailed so they fail to realise their full potential due to underfunding.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">This section of the Bill should be stronger. To state the local authority "may" is a weak statement of intent. In section 5(1) of the Bill, it states, "the Minister shall promote the Arts Board inside and outside the State". Why then in section 6(2), does it only state, "a local authority may provide funding"? The Minister has already used the word "shall", which is a stronger and more definite statement. I see no reason this amendment cannot be accepted.</p>

It would not be a major step to change the word "may" to "shall" because it would still leave some discretion for local authorities. We would not be forcing them to act or be tying their hands because section 6(2) states "A local authority may provide such financial or other assistance as it considers appropriate. . . ". Therefore, the local authority would still have discretion as to the amount of financial assistance it would provide for the arts and, as such, there would be no harm in changing the word "may" to "shall".</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It is a pity my amendment No. 22 was ruled out of order because in giving local authorities these responsibilities and duties, cognisance should be taken of that by the Minister for Finance, and additional moneys should be provided as a necessary step to allow local authorities to promote and participate in arts programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">This morning, I was listening to a radio programme which featured a discussion on tourism in Ireland and how to attract visitors to our shores. Among the key elements identified in that  programme were arts and sport. If we are to attract tourists we need to ensure that local authorities play a proper role in promoting the arts and providing the necessary financial assistance to ensure that the public understands, participates in and appreciates the arts locally. If at all possible, standards must be improved so that we can have an appreciation of community based arts that is second to none and is the envy of other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The amendment seeks to place a duty on local authorities to provide some financial assistance for the arts. If the word "may" is left in the section, local authorities may decide it is not appropriate to give such financial assistance due to lack of funds. If the wording was changed, however, they would have to provide a minimum of funding, at least. In the past, the problem was that the first item to be cut from the public purse was the arts and cultural matters.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I support the amendment. The difference between "may" and "shall" in this section could be of immense significance. I will make one point to illustrate that. At the moment, many local authorities are preparing revised city or county development plans. If the word "shall" was inserted in the section, it would mean those drafting such plans in future would have to have a cultural charter to deal with the arts. On the other hand, if the word "may" is left in place, local authorities would be entirely free to leave alone such matters as being residual.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The difficulties for this section in retaining "may" instead of "shall", will flow from section 6(2), which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_345">A local authority may provide such financial or other assistance as it considers appropriate to such persons or in respect of such activities, projects or undertakings, for the purposes of–</p>
          <p eId="para_346">(<i>a</i>) stimulating public interest in the arts,</p>
          <p eId="para_347">(<i>b</i>) promoting knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts, or</p>
          <p eId="para_348">(<i>c</i>) improving standards in the arts, within its functional area.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The section singularly omits any obligation to fund an initiative in the arts. One can create interest in, work on promoting knowledge of, and improve standards in the arts, but one cannot bring the arts into existence as part of a community's or local authority's cultural space. The section reveals the designation of the arts as something separate from people's broader or deeper cultural life. It regards the arts as residual or optional but not central. The only way in which we will see a significant advance on the 1970s legislation, which made it possible for local authorities to fund the arts, is when it becomes normal for a local authority, in drafting, preparing and funding its plans, to consider the arts as being a central element.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">In the old days, people in local authorities discussed the provision of housing in terms of pro viding square footage of housing and shelter but they neglected the environment in which people lived. Modern thinking would regard housing estate management, for example, as including ecological space and environmental concerns. We should not continue with the notion that members of local authorities may or may not do a bit for the arts, depending upon their whim and the lobbyists.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The distinction between "may" and "shall" raises further questions about arts officers working for local authorities. The use of the word "shall" in this respect would mean that not only would such posts be included as a normal part of estimates' provision and planning, but it would also give a clearly defined function to arts officers. In the absence of such a defined function, some arts officers report to the secretary of a local authority while others may report to the manager or engineer. The inclusion of the word "shall" would significantly improve current practice. While the amendment represents a minor change of wording, financial provision for the arts should be established as something that is required, and that would be a huge difference. The amendment would not only strengthen this legislation immensely but it would also have a knock-on effect in making adequate provision for other areas. While I am afraid it will take decades to achieve the movement of artistic activity, through creativity, towards the recognition of the right to culture, this amendment would begin to move resources in that direction.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue):</from>
          <p eId="para_352">It is not the intention of this section or of the Bill to treat the arts as something residual – quite the opposite, in fact. The intention is to bring centrality to the arts and we will achieve that through this legislation. If one examines the amendment in detail one will realise that it would not achieve the objective which its proponents suggest. For it to have any realistic impact, one would have to specify minimum funding levels. If one does not do so, then it is clear that a local authority which was not serious about its arts plan, could simply allocate a very small amount of money to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The amendment as framed merely requires that the local authority concerned would make some allocation but in the absence of specifying a minimum level, it could not have any appreciable impact. It will be clear to Members of the House that there is no way the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Finance would agree to an amendment to the effect that a certain minimum level of funding must be provided in order to implement the arts plan. This does not apply in other areas of activity for any local authority. Obviously, a local authority is dependent on the commercial rates and charges it collects, as well as on Exchequer funding. All allocations are made by local authorities on the basis of what funding they have from year to year. In the cir cumstances, it would not be possible to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall:</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I find it difficult to understand the Minister's stance on this matter. As previous speakers have stated, development plans are being initiated in practically every local authority in the country at present. If this legislation is passed, each local authority will be able to opt out of providing facilities in those plans to develop the arts. This amendment would ensure that each local authority had to provide facilities in the development plan for a proper arts section. We all know that local authorities must put pieces of art on infrastructural developments by the National Roads Authority and many other such organisations. This would add to that in each local authority area and live theatre would benefit. The Minister is not right to say this would mean local authorities would have to put a certain amount of money aside each year to develop the arts. It means they must recognise that they must provide funding for the arts. There is a difference. If we are serious about developing the arts, we must start at local authority level.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">This is an ideal opportunity to provide arts facilities. The Bill is being introduced at the right time in terms of local authorities' development plans and it will generate new interest in the arts. An arts officer from Westmeath County Council, who came before the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, stated that there was a need to recognise the role local authorities must play. This is an ideal opportunity to do that. I support the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_356">When I asked the Minister on Committee Stage what the difference was between this Bill and the Acts of 1951 and 1973, he said there was special provision for the arts in local authorities. If the Bill is to be meaningful in terms of support for the arts and local authorities, this amendment is essential. As regards the economic value of cultural tourism in County Kerry, for example, it is obvious that places, such as Siamsa Tíre, the national event centre in Killarney and the Writers' Centres in Listowel and Dunquin, are important parts of our tourism industry. The tourism attractions in the county are based on the arts. Last weekend a number of fleánna ceoil were held across the county, including Lixnaw and Brosna.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">It is obvious that the Arts Council will not be able to support the large number of organisations across the country, irrespective of how much it gets. The only other source of funding will be local authorities. They must prepare an arts plan. However, there is no point having an arts plan unless the funding is available. I have received correspondence from arts officers in local authorities throughout the country and they are all strapped for cash. They cannot put their programmes in place or plan for the years ahead  because they do not know how much funding they will get from the Arts Council or from the local authority. The reduction in the local government fund this year has affected the arts. The first thing to get the chop in local authorities when funding is reduced is the arts and other so-called fringe activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The points have been well made by Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Wall and Michael Higgins. The case is clear. If the Minister wants to make this a meaningful Bill and if he feels the difference between this Bill and previous Acts is that it gives a greater role to local authorities, then he must accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh:</from>
          <p eId="para_359">I also fail to understand the Minister's argument because the amendment does not set minimum funding levels. As the other Deputies said, it would force local authorities to have a discussion on arts funding every year. When the annual Estimates are being dealt with, local authorities would have to discuss financial and other assistance to deal with stimulating public interest in the arts, promoting knowledge and improving standards. They would then have to set a cost. The people we are talking about are democratically elected. If there was a public desire for the arts to be promoted in an area, the people would know they could go to their councillors and ask, or force them if necessary, to increase the level of funding to develop the arts. We are not tying a local authority to a specific minimum cost, but to a discussion when drawing up the development plans and dealing with the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">If local authorities examined expenditure on the arts, they would realise the benefits which can be recouped. The more artists are encouraged to put their art on display in an area and the more the public takes an interest in it, the more likely we are to increase the level of tourism. We have a great reputation for the arts and we can enhance it by ensuring it is not only one or two councils which play a pivotal role in arts promotion, but that every council makes it a priority when discussing the annual Estimates. It will be a pity if the Minister does not change it. It will not tie local authorities to a specific minimum cost because they will still have discretion. The Bill states that a local authority may "provide such financial or other assistance as it considers appropriate". If a local authority considered it appropriate to spend €100 or €100 million, it would be answerable to the public.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue:</from>
          <p eId="para_361">The local authority will also be answerable if it prepares an arts plan but does not provide any funding. I have already explained why the objective of the amendment cannot be attained, without specifying minimum levels of funding. In section 6 there is a statutory imperative on the local authority to prepare an arts plan. Deputy Ó Snodaigh has made my argument for me. If there is a statutory imperative on a local authority to  prepare an arts plan, as provided for in the legislation, it must follow that the local authority would be open to considerable justified criticism if it were to take no action whatsoever on implementing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I favour decentralisation of Government; it has even been implied in some quarters that I should open a consultancy on it but I have failed to do so to date. I fully recognise that the local authority network of arts officers is crucial to supporting the arts, particularly in rural areas and I fully accept the arts need to be funded at local level. A number of local authorities do not fund the arts adequately but others do. I visited Mayo recently and I was impressed by the level of activity in towns such as Westport and Castlebar. Local authorities with the will to do the business are doing so and those that do not have the will are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">From this point on, there will be a statutory obligation on local authorities to produce arts plans and in those circumstances I return to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point. A local authority that takes no action to implement its own plan would be subjected to a great deal of criticism, not only at political level, but also from the general public and those involved in the sector.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_364">There is no doubt this issue will be raised again in the Seanad and perhaps we will have to revisit it if amendments are made there. The Minister has examined the legislation long and hard, given that the Second Stage debate took place this time last year. Submissions were received in response to the document, Towards a New Framework for the Arts, and the report on them was compiled by Theo Dorgan. The report emphasised local authority arts and a number of contributions viewed a properly funded local authority arts programme as one of the ways forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The national spatial strategy is under discussion currently and a similar strategy could be applied to the arts to ensure all communities would be exposed to the arts and would have the opportunity to experience professional drama, music and other art forms. That is the not the case at present. People in many local authority areas are completely deprived of the opportunity to enjoy various art forms. When I hear about the arts provision in a number of local authorities, I feel great sympathy for those who live in those areas and have a great interest in the arts as they must travel long distances to enjoy simple events such as plays or concerts.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Minister was a councillor and his family has a close association with the local authority in Kerry. I appeal to him to explore the immense opportunities presented by the local authority structure for the provision and promotion of the arts. Local authorities are rooted in communities and provide a great opportunity in this regard. We must cease looking to the Arts Council in Merrion Square as the solution to all the prob lems in the arts. Other possibilities exist, of which the local authority structure is one.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Every local authority should have an arts officer but I do not know whether the Minster can enshrine that provision in the legislation. There should be an obligation on all local authorities to appoint an arts officer. Tight budgetary constraints will be imposed on local authorities again next year and a number of them might examine the position of their arts officers if their contracts come up for renewal because arts officers are employed on a temporary basis in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">This is another aspect of the local authority arts issue that the Minister could examine. The Minister will not accept the amendment. We have had a good discussion and have made a number of points regarding the importance of local authorities and the arts. I hope the Minister will take seriously the views expressed. I also hope that over his term in office he will give as much support as possible to local authority arts officers in order that they can implement their arts plan and that he will be mindful of the positive contribution local authorities can make to the arts.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">In page 6, to delete lines 32 to 35.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The arm's length principle has always been accepted by various Governments and Taoisigh since the introduction of the first Arts Bill in 1951. The principle was emphasised by a number of Taoisigh on several occasions, including Mr. Charles Haughey, who was regarded as a great patron of the arts. I quoted him extensively on Committee Stage to support my argument that this principle should prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">State support is needed for the arts, not State control. The Arts Council should not be seen as an arm of the Government or as an instrument of Government policy. Aspects of this legislation could lead to a diminution of the arm's length principle and the independence of the Arts Council. It is popular to be critical of the council and it is easy to blame the council for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">On the other hand I have been disappointed with Arts Council funding. I am involved in a large number of organisations in my constituency, some of which applied to the Arts Council for funding. For example, Listowel Writers' Centre, which is an important institution in Kerry, did not get any funding. As a director of that centre, I am very disappointed that we have not received funding from anyone. We must survive on the income we generate there. Such an important centre, which puts on exhibitions on the works of writers such as John B. Keane, Brian McMahon,  Brendan Kennelly, should have had funding, but it did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I know the Minister has a provision here that the arm's length principle will prevail as regards the allocation of grants, but section 9(1)(<i>e</i>) gives fairly strong powers to the Minister and a Minister – I am not saying the present Minister – could certainly abuse the power this subparagraph would give him or her. That is why it should be deleted.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Minister has stated that he, as Minister, has a responsibility to ensure that he can direct the Arts Council in certain ways other than in providing grants. The respect for the Arts Council, which has been built up over the years, should prevail, and this subparagraph, and other parts of the Bill, will endanger that principle in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">On Second Stage I mentioned that in the 20th century Governments in other countries used the arts and artists to serve their own ends. For instance, in Germany, one of the first sections of societies to be exploited by Hitler was the arts area. That is probably an extreme example but it was referred to in the Dorgan report, that where there is serious Government involvement with the Arts Council in directing the arts it could be used for the wrong purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">For the reasons I outlined, here and on Second and Committee Stages, the Bill would be better, as regards ensuring the protection of the integrity of the independence of the Arts Council, if this subparagraph was removed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_378">I want to make a few points on this principle of deletion. Before I do so, this is perhaps the first opportunity I have had of wishing the Minister well in everything he is doing in the arts, and I do so sincerely.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">As a former Minister with some responsibilities in the area, in a broader area which then included culture, I was very much in favour of the arm's length principle. I should also state that, in fairness to those who advised me, I had one adviser, Colm Ó Briain, who was a former director of the Arts Council, who was even more enthusiastically in favour of the arm's length principle, and very vigorously so.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In proposing this deletion, the case has been built by Deputy Deenihan around the principle that there is an arm's length between the Minister and the Council. Whoever the Minister is, this distance is important. Those who practice the arts – we have had a long history of people who practice different kinds of the arts in different circumstances in Ireland – should always be creatively troublesome to whoever is the Minister or to the Department concerned. That is the way the arts develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">What I have a real problem about is in this entire section of the Bill, but I am sticking to the words in front of us, the proposed deletion of five lines. My problem about it is that there is a philosophical assumption here which, I am afraid, I  must reject outright. I agree there are people who can take a totally different view on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">When I was Minister, the whole purpose of it being a Department of culture was that it accepted access. It accepted the normalcy and centrality of creativity as a normal part of life. This was built about the Benson report of 1979, with its emphasis on access and creativity being defined socially as opposed to a narrower, more elitist version of the arts in which one defined practice within the arts in terms of standards and so forth. There was a nonsensical and false divide between those, for example, who for a long period, in different Governments, set up a tension between what they saw was the democratic community arts tendency and those who said they were defending standards in the arts. The problem about all of that was one could get excellence and one could get access.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">However, when I read subparagraphs (<i>a</i>),(<i>b</i>),(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), for example, subparagraph (<i>a</i>), to “stimulate public interest in the arts,”, the assumption is that the arts are outside of the person, outside of the society and outside of the community. To “promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts,” is a suggestion that the only thing standing there are barriers of ignorance. The reality is the arts are not separate from the person; every person is potentially creative.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Therefore I am being straight about this. This kind of thinking and language is a rejection of everything that was in the Benson report, the most important report on the arts practice, access and creativity in the history of the State. Section 9(1)(<i>c</i>) states to “assist in improving standards in the arts,”, but there is a huge problem about the arrival of new forms of art, which include innovation in the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Then the section moves on to (<i>d</i>), to “advise the Minister in relation to the performance of any of his or her functions under this Act, when so requested by the Minister,”. This will arise in section 10. I will speak on section 10, but I just want to state that in that important section, the conditions under which we allow artists here to function are outrageous. No artist practising here, including all of the actors, would qualify for social housing. None of them would qualify for any one of the housing schemes in the local authorities on the basis of income. Most go into employment exchanges, where they cannot describe themselves as “an unemployed actor”. Few have pension provisions and many have no health provisions. I will return to the deletion in a moment, but I discussed this once with another person who was interested in the arts, former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, who had made some changes that were of benefit to artists but who, when I suggested a pension scheme for the artists, said to me, “Why do you want to draw them on you? Look all I did for them and the thanks I got.” The fact is we will talk about this on the next section, if the Chair likes, but on the position on this amendment the Arts Council, if it was  serious, should be out there making the case I have just made.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Does the Arts Council exist to "assist the Minister in the performance of his or her functions under this Act"– that is fine –"and in the implementation of Government policies . . . "? However, if Government policies ignore such examples as I have just given, the subparagraph I quote is an invitation to the Arts Council to be complicit in ignoring a fundamental necessary provision for the role of the artist.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">As a former Minister, I repeat that I wish I could have been able to do more, but that is not the issue. The issue is that very often when we are talking in this way, we are patronising the arts and patronising the population, and are not speaking about access, and we are doing nothing for the position of the artist. Equity, the actors' group, came to me 30 years ago making a case on the position of actors and actresses, but it is part of the decorative view of the arts. If we do not care about it, and about unemployment, bad health, bad housing and unpaid ESB bills of performing artists, we have been getting it all on the cheap. We have been living off the sweat of people to whom we do not afford minimal working conditions. That is the truth of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Arts Council should be free to speak to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, to go to his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and to the Department of Finance to address these issues as they arise in the next session. The Bill states that the function of the Arts Council is "to assist the Minister in the performance of any of his or her functions and the implementation of Government policies and objectives in relation to the arts". I am sure the present Minister is more than adequate in the performance of his functions. The question of what these are will arise a thousand times. Does this mean complicity in the omissions in policy? Does it mean endorsement of the policy? The Bill states: "When so requested by the Minister". I did not interfere with the Arts Council in my time and other Ministers of other parties in other Governments did not, to my knowledge, try to use their influence. I am not suggesting it would be automatic; it is a bad principle. Autonomy is everything in relation to the Arts Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Arts Council is at its best when it is doing more than operating. It is not its problem to manage the arts, it is not its problem to only promote interest in or of the arts. The Arts Council is there in the two previous Acts to look after the artistic space of the community and that, believe it or not, includes artists. It is time we heard from them about artists, for example, in relation to the facilities that are being run and funded. I have authority to speak on that subject because it was in my time that all the different theatres and arts facilities were established. The operation of those facilities and the relationship with local authorities is not only one of competent management in the normal sense of management, it is to bring into existence a new theory of management that  takes account of the fact that the people who work in them are artists and creative people. It should have by now led to a whole new philosophy of management of the artistic spaces. That requires distance from Government, whoever is in government. It also requires the notion of different forms of the arts that are experiencing difficulty in coming into existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Before I am lectured by anybody, nobody is in a position to lecture in a country that in the first legislation did not include dance as an artistic activity – it was just left out – or where there is not much reference to the manner in which we have allowed ourselves to become uniquely deprived of music education. These are all examples of why it is important that the Arts Council should continually draw attention to the needs of artists, the value of arts and the value of the cultural space, its enrichment and normalcy. The council should continually make demands on Government and highlight what is being neglected. It is stated that the role of the Arts Council is the implementation of Government policies and objectives in relation to the arts. I can put the net issue in two sentences. That can never be the limited agenda of any self-respecting arts council. I will deal with the question of composition later. This may work for other kinds of activities but it makes a nonsense of the nature of an arts council.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">This is an area which may be more suitable to the use of the word "may" in that the general function of the council may be to assist the Minister whereas the use of the word "shall" ties the Arts Council to the future diversion of financial and other resources to dealing with the Minister, facilitating the Minister's performance under the Act and the implementation of Government policies. That is a job for the Department rather than the Arts Council. I support this amendment. If it was phrased that the council "may" assist the Minister, it would allow it to decide how best to use its resources and what would be the best return for the artists and those affected by the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">The arguments being put forward in relation to this issue are greatly exaggerated. Connotations of Hitler and a latter-day Goebbels are something which I regret.

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue:</from>
          <p eId="para_394">Since becoming Minister I have sought to ensure that the door of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is open so that the wind of change could sweep through it. I have sought genuinely to do that and it is not my intention to stifle the artistic endeavour  or creativity of what is a very imaginative generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">This provision was replicated to a large degree in 1951 when a section in the legislation provided that the council could advise the Government on relevant matters. I am seeking to ensure that the council will have the opportunity of advising the Government. It would be a mistake on my part to close off the resource which is surely available to the Government if the Arts Council can provide the kind of advice and assistance which is required. If the Government cannot rely on the Arts Council, its own statutory body, to advise it, then to whom should it turn? I have stated many times to Deputy Deenihan in this House and in committee that there is no question of the arms-length principle being interfered with. It was never enshrined in legislation. It is a good custom and a good practice. I have stated consistently that funding decisions will be made by the Arts Council <i>sui juris </i>and I have not sought, under any circumstances, to ensure that it would be subjected to any diktat of Government or of anybody else in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I accept the argument of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who was a distinguished predecessor of mine, in relation to the penury of people involved in the arts sector. Deputy Higgins has made a telling point and he is correct in what he says. However, I must point out that I am not forming a trade union in this legislation – were I forming a trade union I would naturally make the arguments which Deputy Higgins has made. I am seeking to provide functions for the Arts Council. If one looks at the lists which I have outlined in section 9 in regard to the functions of the council, one will realise that the functions are quite ambitious and appropriate, and almost as exhaustive as one could make it in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">It is important to state that other Departments clearly impinge upon the artist. It is very important that the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals with each individual's entitlement, but I do not think that Deputy Higgins is suggesting – nor would he, I am sure – that I could enter some form of social welfare provision into legislation of this kind. It is simply something which I could not possibly do.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">With regard to the definition of the arts, I know Deputy Higgins will welcome the fact that this legislation recognises dance in the definition of the arts for the first time in the history of the State. His argument regarding dance is well made.</p>

Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Luas project rests with the Railway Procurement Agency. I understand from the agency that the current timetable for the opening of the Luas lines is August 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station lines and June 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. These dates allow for a period of up to three months for testing, commissioning and general safety checking before passenger services commence. I have conveyed my concerns to the agency about the importance of meeting these targets and have asked that all the necessary steps be taken to ensure that services commence at the earliest possible date.</p>

These dates allow for a testing period of three months – this period is taken into account when determining the opening dates. Lest there be any confusion about what the Deputy said about other dates, I reiterate that the lines will open in June and August 2004.

I have not given any new dates to the House today. I have received and almost finalised the new signs for Dublin which require the approval of the Department. I should be able to clear the signs shortly and they should be erected within weeks. I hope this will help the traffic situation. I cannot agree to a partial opening of the Luas lines. As the system is electrified, I think it is best to finish the construction work and to open all sections of the lines on the dates I have mentioned. I do not think it would be practical to try to manage it in a piecemeal fashion.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">The Minister has already travelled on the Luas system and is aware that sections of it are operational. The chairman of the RPA, Mr. Padraic White, said in 2001 that the Luas system was progressing to schedule and within budget at that stage. We know that the budget has increased from just under €300 million to just under €800 million. Can the Minister assure the House that the project's cost will remain within the revised budget? Given that it was on time in 2001, will he explain why it has now fallen behind schedule and will not be ready until June 2004?</p>

          <p eId="para_410">I have already acknowledged that it is some months behind schedule. I have been told by the RPA that the new dates of June and August 2004 are fairly firm. The estimated capital cost of completion is €691 million and there is provision for a risk figure on top of that. It is not fair to quote the earlier figure of €300 million, because substantial alteration and redesign were undertaken before final approval was given. It is important to state that the Luas pro ject is broadly within budget, if one takes into account the risk provision that was included in the construction costs. Although it is a couple of months behind schedule I am satisfied that it is progressing well, especially when one considers the factors I have mentioned such as the complexity of the work and the number of people involved. The deadlines I have outlined should be met.</p>

      if he will make a statement on the implications of the proposed Luas crossing at the Red Cow roundabout; the reason a new bridge was not included in the original plans; the consideration which he has given to providing alternative arrangements in order to avoid severe congestion and delay; and the action he now proposes to take.

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_412">As the Deputy is aware, the Railway Procurement Agency is responsible for the management of the Luas project. The agency has informed me that the alignment of the tram path at the Red Cow roundabout was the subject of detailed discussions with the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council prior to the granting of an order to construct the Tallaght to Connolly Station line. This followed detailed consideration at the public inquiry held into the proposals put forward by the then CIE light rail project office, the work of which was subsequently taken over by the RPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The RPA's view is that the Luas system will have no negative impact on traffic conditions at the roundabout. Discussions on options for providing access for road vehicles to and from the Luas stop at the Red Cow park and ride and interchange facility have recently taken place between the Railway Procurement Agency, the Dublin Transportation Office, the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council. Such discussions were facilitated by an independent adviser appointed by my Department. I have just received the adviser's report and I am studying its recommendations with a view to reaching an early decision on the matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Ms Shortall:</from>
          <p eId="para_414">It is nonsense for the RPA to say that the Luas will not have a negative impact on the Red Cow roundabout. Does the Minister not accept that it is the busiest junction in the country which carries some 80,000 vehicles a day on the M50 and 60,000 on the N7? There is already traffic chaos at that junction. Does he not appreciate that there are delays of up to 40 minutes at evening peak time and that it is a source of much frustration for the many motorists who use the junction?</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Does he not further accept that it is a recipe for disaster to add a tram to that already chaotic situation, especially one that will have to stop at three red lights in crossing that junction? Does he not accept that this will exacerbate the existing traffic problems and seriously undermine the  attractiveness and the speed of Luas in terms of trying to encourage people to get out of cars and use public transport?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">What does the Minister foresee will arise at that roundabout on a regular basis because of the conflict between cars on both the M50 and the N7 and the need for Luas to cross traffic at three points in each direction?</p>
          <p eId="para_417">When the members of the Joint Committee on Transport recently asked Padraic White about this, he replied that the Minister was investigating the matter. It is difficult to understand why the RPA did not deal with this adequately in the original plans for the Luas.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">What steps is the Minister taking? Is it the case that there should have been a dedicated and extended bridge provided for that crossing? Why was it not provided and what steps does the Minister intend taking to avoid the likely chaos that is going to result at that junction?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_265" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I accept that it would have been better if this project had been designed differently. That is the view which I expressed to the Railway Procurement Agency, the Dublin Transportation Office, the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council. However, these decisions were taken some years ago. There was also a public inquiry which signed off on it. There was quite an extensive deliberation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">An enormous number of experts from the agencies I mentioned take the view that the Luas will move thousands of cars from the area. They make the point that the tram path does not run through the roundabout. It crosses the slip roads but not the roundabout proper. They point out that the trams will cross the M50 on a new Luas bridge which, obviously, does not cross the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I have spoken about the slip lanes. There is a new slip lane in place in one direction. I have also been told that it will not require the introduction of additional traffic lights, that the gap in the existing traffic lights will be adequate to allow the train through only when road traffic on these slip lanes is stopped. The design of the alignment also allows for trams to stop completely clear of the road traffic lanes. As I said, these provisions went through a public inquiry and were decided many years ago. One is now at the stage of looking at what options are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Deputy raised a sensible question in regard to park and ride. I went to look at it on two occasions in recent weeks. It is intended that the park and ride facility will hold 750 cars. I accept that it is difficult to access it from the Naas Road. If one is coming up from Naas one has to go around the roundabout and back up to get into the park and ride area.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">It has been proposed that a special overpass bridge be built so that one could turn left off the Naas Road, go up through Monastery Road out onto a new road and down into the park and ride facility. The estimated cost of this project is €20  million at today's prices. It would take two years to build so one can add a few bob to that by the time it would be completed. The issue is whether one can justify sanctioning a €20 million or €30 million project for 750 cars. Would that be a proper use of public funds?</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I appointed a planning expert to investigate the matter over a three or four week period and he has now given me his report. The report suggests that we do not proceed with the overpass. As I am still studying the report I have not yet made a decision in regard to it. The bottom line is that it does not recommend that it would provide value for money to make provision for 750 cars in the context of the 80,000 cars that pass through there every day. I will make a decision shortly and keep an eye on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Rightly or wrongly, dozens of experts spread throughout the RPA, the NRA, the Dublin Transportation Office and the engineers of South Dublin County Council came to these conclusions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_436">The national development plan,  NDP, together with the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, form the strategic policy context for the upgrading of the national road network in the period to 2006. The implementation of individual projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Good progress has been made in regard to the upgrading of the five interurban routes. Of the total of 31 projects on these routes, three have been completed, eight are under way and planning and design work is well advanced on the remaining 20 projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Preferred route corridors have been identified for all projects. The completion shortly of two further major projects on the M1 will provide a motorway-standard route from Dublin to just south of Dundalk. Work is under way, or about to start shortly, on the Kildare bypass, the south-eastern motorway, the Dublin Port tunnel, the Watergrasshill bypass, the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, the Monasterevin bypass and the Cashel bypass.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">In addition, a substantial programme of work is under way and in planning on other national routes. Major projects under construction include the Glen of the Downs and Ashford-Rathnew bypasses on the N11 and the Ballincollig bypass on the N22. Other projects due to start this year or early next year include the Carrickmacross bypass and the Waterford city bypass. By any standards, this is a major programme of road improvements. Route by route the national road network is being upgraded.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Exchequer investment in the national roads programme has increased dramatically. Total Exchequer investment in the national roads programme over the period 2000-03 will amount to €3.823 billion. This is approximately 13% greater than the amount provided for in the NDP. Investment in the programme in 2003 has been maintained at a high level despite the more difficult economic and budgetary conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The increased cost of the programme, however, has impacted on the pace and momentum of implementation. Delivery of some projects, including those on the major interurban routes will, therefore, take longer than originally anticipated. On the basis of a continuation of existing levels of funding the NRA estimates that full completion of the major interurban routes could extend to 2009-10. However, route completion dates will depend on the funding levels available in the years ahead, including from additional funding sources, and on construction and land acquisition costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"><i>Additional information.</i>I will seek to ensure that the major interurban routes are completed to motorway, high-quality standard to the greatest extent possible by 2006, or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">In this context, my Department is currently seeking to agree with the Department of Finance a rolling multiannual funding framework for the  national roads programme in order to provide a better basis for forward planning. Options for additional funding for the programme are also being considered by my Department and the NRA in conjunction with the recently established National Development Finance Agency. It will also be important for all involved in the implementation of the programme to continue to strengthen cost estimation and control procedures in order to ensure that we get maximum value for money for the high levels of investment in the programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">Is it not the case that the costing for many of these projects has varied dramatically with the reality, from 58% over budget to 48% under budget in some cases? In light of that fact and that the issue of delivery is based on the availability of finance, has the Minister received any report yet from the National Development Finance Agency about the new methods for the capital programmes? Why is the Department not considering the alternative systems of design, build and operate or build only or operate only? Will the Minister and his Department consider collection of the tolls on these routes by the State, to be used for funding other development projects?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_446">We have had discussions with the National Development Finance Agency about sources of additional funding and those discussions are continuing. I am very much in favour of design and build and fixed price contracts. As a result of my discussions with the NRA, it is now including greater use of design and build, lump sum, fixed price contracts than heretofore. I have asked the NRA to move as quickly as possible, in so far as contractual arrangements allow, to an exclusive use of design and build which, in effect, is a form of fixed price contract. I take the view it is better to pay up-front for the risk, once it is quantified, rather than holding on to the end and finding out that the risk was more expensive than one had thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">With regard to State tolls, I am interested in the Deputy's comments and have listened carefully. The PPP is currently designed on the use of private tolling because it brings private sector funding into the system. If one were to move to State tolls, that source of private sector funding would not be available and the State would have to secure the toll income itself. I have not ruled that out – it is a matter of establishing whether the sums add up in that regard and whether, in the absence of private sector funding, one can make the arrangement work and pay. I have asked the NDFA and the Department to look, fairly urgently, at that prospect. Quite bluntly, I do not care whether the State or the private sector runs the tolls provided the building of the road is secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I have had some discussions with the National Pensions Reserve Fund. While that body is totally independent of Government, I have urged it to consider investment in infrastructure. That would be an independent decision for it to make on behalf of its future pensioners. I have pointed out the possible attractiveness of investing in some infrastructure, where there would possibly – I emphasise possibly – be a State toll available to the fund as income. Having put those thoughts to the fund, I am awaiting a final response from that body and from the National Development Finance Agency as to whether there is any scope in this area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten:</from>
          <p eId="para_449">I will put a few very brief questions to the Minister, in light of his response. Is he saying the NRA will stall on the design currently taking place? Is it not the case that all the inter-urban routes have been virtually designed already so that there will be no impact on that? Finally, I draw the Minister's attention to a statement by Mr. Jim Power, chief executive of Friends First, that the constitutional change proposed in relation to land purchase and prices is an act of desperation on the part of the Government and that there have not been any positive developments from the Government as to how it will fund the projects to date.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_450">The position with regard to funding is quite clear. In 1997, expenditure on motorways was about €300 million per year. Five years later, we were spending €600 million per year and this year we are spending €1.2 billion. The actual spend on motorways has doubled within three years. In the past, much of this was funded by European money, but the current expenditure is virtually all taxpayers' money. I take the point that we have not got the expected output and results for that expenditure. I hope I have made the necessary changes to tighten the situation very substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">In response to the Deputy's question as to whether the NRA is stalling, there is no question of that – it is forging ahead to roll out the network as quickly as possible. The issue of tolling is somewhat separate. Once it is clear that a particular road will be tolled – that is an NRA decision, not mine – the issue of whether it should be a private or public operation can then be addressed. Lest there should be confusion, there is currently no facility for State tolling, apart from the present temporary one at Drogheda by the NRA.</p>

      asked the

      his rationale for his stated objective of franchising out 25% of Dublin bus routes; the way in which he views it will lead to improved services for commuters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [16985/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_453">On 7 November last, I made a statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum, in which I outlined in detail my proposals for the reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area, involving the phased introduction of franchising. Initial proposals for franchising were made in a Government consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, published in September 2000. These proposals took account of research by my Department which looked, in particular, at experiences in London, Stockholm and Helsinki. That research concluded that where franchising had been introduced, operating and subvention costs had reduced and service quality had improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In response to the proposals outlined in that consultation paper, the Public Transport Partnership Forum commissioned a consultancy study, the NERA report, to examine models of transport regulation in a range of cities around the world to assist it in making a formal statement of its views in response to that consultation paper. Nine cities were identified as being representative of the wide range of existing approaches to public transport regulation. The report summarised key aspects of each city's performance, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each city's approach. In general, the report supported the introduction of competitive tendering for bus services in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The European Commission also undertook independent research which supported the case for introducing controlled competition in public transport. This research led the Commission to publish proposals for a regulation which would require member states to tender for the provision of subvented public transport services. These research findings led me to propose that controlled competition in the form of bus franchising should be introduced in the greater Dublin area. I am convinced that, properly designed and implemented, it can lead to significant improvements in service provision and reductions in the level of subvention for a given level of service. I have proposed that up to 25% of the market be franchised in 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Ms Shortall:</from>
          <p eId="para_456">Does the Minister accept that traffic congestion is the main difficulty in operating efficient and profitable bus services in the Dublin area? Traffic congestion is costing Dublin Bus in the region of €150 million per year. Does the Minister agree that a franchising system on 25% of the routes will not provide competition? Replacing publicly owned services by privately owned services is not competition. Will the Minister explain how that will result in an improved service for commuters? Is it not the case that, short of sprouting wings, private operators will not be able to run a service which is more efficient or more reliable than Dublin Bus is currently providing?</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Does the Minister agree that Dublin Bus has brought its costs down to the absolute minimum  at this stage and that there is really no further room for improvement in that regard? How does the Minister expect that a private operator will run a more efficient service which will be as accountable as the Dublin Bus services? As public representatives, all of us are aware of difficulties with regard to routes, where large sections of population are not being served. Dublin Bus, by and large, goes out of its way to accommodate the demands of citizens. It is responsive to public representatives and to the Department, which will not necessarily be the case with private operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">It is very difficult to understand how the Minister's proposals will make any difference to the travelling public – perhaps he will explain the basis for that. Does he agree, in respect of those routes which are profitable – of which there are not many – and where, currently, Dublin Bus can use its profits from the more profitable routes to cross-subsidise the less profitable ones, that the benefit of that profit will now be lost to the taxpayer? It will go into the pockets of private operators. What is the Minister's rationale for franchising out 25% of the routes? Is there any indication whatsoever that it will lead to an improved service. My contention is that the reverse will be the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I agree that traffic congestion is a big problem, as the Deputy has stated. The existing quality bus corridors and our decision to double the number of those in the city within the next year or so will help greatly. Other developments, including completion of the Luas and the Dublin Port tunnel, sorting out the situation with regard to the M50 and better traffic management will also help greatly to relieve congestion. Those are the practical measures on which we are already working. We are also considering proposals to open the hard shoulder from satellite towns to the city – that is currently being examined as a possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I accept that Dublin Bus has to put up with a great deal of congestion, as have all of us, and that makes life difficult for it. The basis for my proposal lies in the various studies to which I have referred, including the research in my Department in relation to the nine cities I mentioned. The Public Transport Forum, which is representative of trade unions and others involved, produced its own study, the NERA report, suggesting that franchising is the way forward. In addition, the European Commission's study came to the same conclusion. There is a fairly strong independent body of research which suggests that giving the consumer a choice is a good idea, and consumers will have a choice.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">There are a number of options. We can leave the routes the way they are, of  which the Deputy is in favour, or we could deregulate them fully, which would mean head to head competition. The experience of that in the UK has been disastrous and I do not support it. A third model stemming from the results of research suggests, as in the case of our radio stations, that the routes could be franchised out, operators could make bids for routes and licences for such routes could be awarded on the basis of fares, safety, regulatory—</p>

          <p eId="para_464">—for a set number of years. If a number of complaints against an operator are upheld while the operator holds a franchise or if an operator does not meet the requirements of the franchise set by a regulator, the licence would not be renewed, and that is the difference. At present, there is no facility not to renew a licence for any operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I make it clear that I have no criticism with regard to Dublin Bus. It has come a long way and it has a great fleet. It has good management and a dedicated staff, but I make no apologies for saying to them, as I have said many times, that just because it is a good bus company, does not mean it is entitled to be the only one. The public are entitled to have a choice of a range of services. Consumers are entitled to make their mind up as they go along.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid):</from>
          <p eId="para_478">The Minister, Deputy Brennan, and I met a delegation on 8 April 2003 from the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company to discuss the possible withdrawal or curtailment of certain bus services in Donegal by the company from the end of June 2003, on the grounds that the services involved were loss making and could not be sustained.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Following that meeting I had immediate follow-up discussions with Bus Éireann and it was agreed that Bus Éireann would pursue discussions directly with the company to explore options for continuing bus services in Donegal in the event of a withdrawal or curtailment of services by the company. Those discussions and correspondence, have been ongoing in the meantime, culminating in a meeting last Thursday in Donegal between senior executives from both companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In the latest discussions, there was a detailed exchange of views between both sides, and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company is to follow up with the provision of additional information to Bus Éireann. These contacts are designed to assist in developing appropriate arrangements for the continuing provision of public transport services in north west Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">My Department met senior executives of Bus Éireann yesterday afternoon to hear a report on their discussions with the company, to review the situation, and to discuss options. Further contact is to take place over the next week to progress the matter further.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley:</from>
          <p eId="para_482">I am sure that the Minister of State realises D-day, 30 June, is rapidly approaching – it is less than two weeks away. I am sure he would also agree that Lough Swilly Bus Company has been as important to Donegal as Bus  Éireann is to the rest of this country. Will he agree there are large tracts of areas in Donegal such as Inishowen, the Fanad Peninsula and the area from Letterkenny to Gweebarra where Bus Éireann is virtually unknown? Will he also agree that the Lough Swilly Bus Company has provided an excellent service to those parts of Donegal for more than 70 years since 1929? It is a unique service, one of the oldest in Europe. I ask the Minister of State to do everything he can to maintain it, or does he believe that vast tracts of Donegal can be left without a public transport service?</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The routes threatened to be axed are those serving the remoter parts of Donegal. This service has played a dual role in providing not only a public transport service but a social service. It would be devastating if these parts of Donegal were left without a public transport service.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Minister and the Minister of State met representatives of the Lough Swilly Bus Company and Oireachtas representatives some two months ago. I am disappointed this matter has not yet been resolved. There are plans to deregulate public transport and perhaps these areas of Donegal could be used as pilot areas to try out the Minister's theories on deregulating public transport.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I agree with the Deputy that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company is the oldest cross-Border institution in the State. Unfortunately, its main assets currently are its 96 buses, the average age of which is 20 years old. We are trying to maintain the operation of the services to west Donegal and the Inishowen Peninsula in the interim period. We have been discussing this matter frequently since April. We must try to maintain the operation of these services in the meantime and Bus Éireann must explore the entire network of the service that has been provided to make sure that such a service is provided in the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Deputy must understand that the services about which we are talking are the essential scheduled services. According to my information, it accounts for only 28% of the total revenue of the Lough Swilly Bus Company. The revenue of the company has dramatically fallen by £212,000 stg, most of that loss of revenue has occurred in other areas, a decline in contract revenue of £61,000 stg and garage revenue of £110,000 stg. We are monitoring these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Minister spoke about the appointment of a regulator. We are trying to maintain these services in the interim. We are basing the operation of these services under two legislative measures, the 1932 legislation and the 1958 legislation, the latter accounting for our only being able to provide a subvention to CIE. That legislation prevents us from giving a subsidy. We are trying to make sure this company's services are maintained in the interim, even if by subcontract, and Bus Éireann will continue discussions with the company to explore the continuation of the network of services in the long-term.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley:</from>
          <p eId="para_488">Will the Minister of State agree that the 28% of revenue accruing to the company from the operation of these services provides services for people who do not have public transport of their own? The company also provides a social service. These bus services are used mainly by elderly people travelling to the towns of Falcarragh, Dunglow, Gortahork and even Letterkenny, visiting hospitals, clinics, collecting pensions and so on. There is an important social dimension to the 28% revenue accruing to the company from these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Will the Minister of State give an undertaking to the Dáil that, irrespective of what happens between now and 30 June, these elderly people living in remote areas who are completely dependent on these services will not be left without a public transport service after 30 June? We need to be given that guarantee. Concern about these services is the talk of the county, yet nothing seems to be happening. The Minister of State has given us the up-to-date position, but D-day is upon us and the people affected want their concerns allayed as soon as possible. The Minister of State would be doing these people a great service if he assured them that, irrespective of what happens between now and 30 June, a public transport service to Letterkenny will be operating on 1 July.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">The Lough Swilly Bus Company has been an important aspect of Donegal and without it the people there would not have any public transport. In recent times other agencies have started work on providing a bus service there. Can an imaginative approach not be taken to providing for the rural transport needs of people from counties such as Donegal, particularly for people living in Inishowne from where I come, to ensure that old age pensioners can use their bus pass to travel to Stroove, Malin Head, Glengad and Inch and so on? We need to consider this from a financial point of view, because that is where the problem arises. We can get 300 people to sign a petition to keep the bus going, but we cannot get three people to use the bus. We should examine the idea of using smaller buses to serve these smaller routes to ensure they are more viable. We need to take an overall, imaginative look at the problem and to be realistic in our expectations because we need services to be expanded, not just maintained. There is no point in giving bus passes to pensioners if there is no service. We need to resolve the issue with the Lough Swilly Bus Company. There are people there who are eager to give a contract—</p>

In the three years the service has been in existence, 62% of its funding has come from State or semi-State bodies; in other words, from the Department of Education and Science, from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other bodies in Northern Ireland. I agree with the Deputies that we must look after the older people in our society. We must ensure that certain areas of Donegal have a service and, as Deputy Keaveney said, we should expand those services. The main issue is that people do not seem to be using the services, but we do have a public service obligation and we will try to ensure that the service is not interrupted.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">Despite the greatly increased levels of investment in the national roads programme, the increased cost of the programme, combined with the more difficult economic and budgetary circumstances which limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, requires that we consider all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme. Accordingly, a num ber of options other than the user toll-based PPP programme currently being implemented by the NRA have been identified for examination. These have the potential to generate additional funding for the programme. They include the extension of the proposed tolling regime for the Dublin Port tunnel and the sale of the facility or the securitisation of toll revenues from this and other routes such as the M1. Detailed analyses and studies will be carried out by the NRA in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency. These will take some time to undertake and complete and until they have been carried out, no decision can be taken. In the meantime, construction of the Dublin Port tunnel and completion of the M1 motorway is proceeding as planned.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">Does the Minister accept that the Dublin Port tunnel was designed and approved by Dublin City Council on the basis of its being an alternative route to the docks? Does he accept that the EIS was carried out and that local residents, by and large, supported it on this basis and on the basis of its being toll-free for trucks? The Minister floated an idea in the media last week that he would consider selling it on the introduction of tolls for the trucks, which defies all logic and goes against the agreed truck management policies for the city of Dublin. It goes against what everybody understood the Dublin Port tunnel to be. I am asking the Minister to give a commitment that the tunnel will go ahead without tolling for trucks, the basis on which the tunnel was designed and accepted by everybody. I want the Minister to promise that under no circumstances will trucks have to pay a toll in the port tunnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">It is also logical to follow up one's own party's policy, which in the case of Deputy Shortall's party was to encourage the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in infrastructure. We cannot ask that the pension fund, which has the responsibility for future pensions, be invested in something without an income. This policy can only be followed through in the context of tolling in order that there is an income to pay pensions in the future. That is the logic of the Deputy's own party position with which I agree. I have asked the NDFA and the NRA to consider the possibility of tolling. We must examine every possibility in order that we can roll out the motorway programme at an accel erated pace. We need motorways from Dublin to Cork and Galway and on other routes. The Belfast one is nearly complete. We need to advance these projects urgently. We cannot allow an asset worth billions, with the potential to earn funds which could be used to alleviate traffic problems all over the country, just to sit there. It is in that spirit that we are examining these options. I am not in a position to give any guarantee of the type the Deputy wants.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten:</from>
          <p eId="para_508">Deputy Shortall is right about the logic of tolling vehicles using the port tunnel. Does the Minister agree that the only way the port tunnel can be sold is by bringing in tolls for heavy goods vehicles? Is it not also the case that under EU directives, an alternative route must be provided where there is a tolled route? In light of this, how does the Minister intend to ban heavy goods vehicles from the city centre? It does not make sense. The objective of the port tunnel was to take heavy goods vehicles out of the city, not to put them back on the city streets.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I agree with that. The Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is developing some policies in the area of heavy goods vehicles and road haulage. It is not intended to put trucks in the city centre; it is intended to direct them through the tunnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">There is no legal certainty on that issue, as I understand it. I am not saying there will be tolls on trucks in the port tunnel. The priority is to finish the tunnel as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, I make no apologies for examining every possible way of capitalising income, including via a securitisation process, in order to attract capital which will allow us to roll out our programme throughout the country. That is what is done in most other countries and it is a practical way of doing things. For the national pension fund to own infrastructure would be preferable to the private sector owning it, if I could find a way to do this. That is what I am working on.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">Can the Minister give a commitment that when he says he is considering selling this asset, he wants to sell it to our own pension fund rather than to international financiers? It would help a lot if he could clarify whether that is exactly what he is talking about. In terms of making use of the revenues from any such sale, the Minister gave a long list of roads we need to build, but he seems to have no interest in the capital requirements for public transport pro grammes. Does he see the revenue from this asset being used in his arguments with the Minister for Finance with regard to funding a metro project, a western rail line or any of the myriad other public transport projects waiting in the wings?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_515">My preference, which I think I share with all parties in the House, would be that the pension fund takes a stronger interest in infrastructure. I do not know anyone who has dissented from that view. However, it cannot take an interest in an asset purely in the national interest because under the legislation, it is required to be independent and to look after the future pensioners. They can only make investments if the trustees are satisfied it is a good investment for future pensioners. There is no question of my doing anything other than suggesting to the pension funds that they look at these projects. It is their decision, not mine. My preference would be to make the numbers stack up. It would be right for the country to consider putting some of these infrastructures in the hands of the pension funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">There is significant investment going into public transport. The Luas is almost finished. I hope to bring proposals on the metro to Government shortly. I believe I will be able to make solid progress in that regard. Some €400 million a year for the last couple of years, and for the next couple of years, is being invested in railways, buses, rolling stock, safety, signalling and track.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall:</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I do not think anyone would object to the Minister looking at ways of raising revenue to ensure greater investment in infrastructure. However, what he appears to be proposing in respect of the Dublin Port tunnel is a complete reversal of existing policy. The residents of north Dublin, who have put up with a significant amount of inconvenience, and continue to do so while the port tunnel is being built, deserve to have the position clarified. They have been prepared to put up with that inconvenience on the basis that heavy goods vehicles will be removed from their streets once the tunnel is opened. These trucks will only be removed if the port tunnel remains toll free.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The policy in respect of the management of heavy goods vehicles in Dublin city has been based on that premise and it is not acceptable to consider reversing the policy mid-stream. Will the Minister clarify Deputy Naughten's point? How can one compel trucks to use a dedicated route if it will be tolled? My understanding is that one cannot do so. I would welcome clarification in that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">Following on from what Deputy Shortall said, is it not the case that the reason the EU introduced such a rule is that Irish exporters will not be penalised when travelling throughout  the Continent of Europe? The Minister is now questioning whether this is a valid argument in relation to alternatives to tolls. There is an EU rule which proposes that the Minister must provide an alternative and he cannot implement a ban on heavy goods vehicles in the city while that rule stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">On the financing of roads, has the Minister looked at the implications of the tax system in the United States where there is a financial incentive for international investment from the US to invest in projects within the European Union?</p>

          <p eId="para_523">No decision is taken in this area. We will consider the matter in the period ahead. I have no problem reversing policies if it is the correct thing to do. I believe we should all be flexible in that regard. I want trucks to go through the tunnel and not through the city centre. They will not be permitted to go through the city centre. The legal issue lacks certainty and I will study it further. I will also consider the issue of tax breaks. The Deputy must remember what we are talking about here. Are we saying that trucks may use free of charge valuable infrastructure which cost hundreds of millions of euro, if not billions, regardless of whether they belong to Smurfit, Guinness, multinational companies or well-off firms with a big fleet of trucks? Are we saying to these large multinational companies that they can use free of charge valuable infrastructure provided by Irish taxpayers? That is the other implication of what is being suggested to me. I will reflect on what Deputies are saying because no decision has been taken. However, there are two sides to the story. This is valuable infrastructure, supported by taxpayers, and the argument put forward is that large multinational companies, and other big companies, can use it free of charge.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">Over the years various changes have been made to the regulatory conditions under which provisional licences have effect. I am considering whether further changes are desirable in this regard. In particular, I wish to bring in measures that will reduce long-term reliance on provisional licences. I am also reviewing the provision whereby holders of second provisional licences for cars are not required to be accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for that category of vehicle with a view to ending this arrangement in the course of 2003. All other provisional licence holders other than drivers of motorcycles and work vehicles, must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times when driving in a public place.</p>

When will he introduce the changes promised regarding the second provisional licence? He must be more specific than some time in 2003. I know he is aware that he has already caused chaos as a result of his announcement prior to Christmas. Before he takes a decision in regard to provisional licences, will he put the resources in place to ensure people do not have to wait for six months to do the driving test? When will we see the transitional measures he promised his parliamentary party he would put in place regarding provisional licences?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_533">We should be able to enact the necessary secondary legislation pertaining to the rule of being accompanied on a second provisional licence before the end of 2003. I am trying to give priority in this area to driving testing, which has substantially stabilised. Some 130,000 applicants are currently awaiting their driving test as opposed to 65,000 at the end of 2002. Applications have now fallen to approximately 4,000 a week, which is slightly in excess of the normal weekly intake at this time of year. We have a capacity to undertake 200,000 tests per annum. Based on all these statistics, and receiving approximately 250,000 applications this year, the average waiting time for a test is now 16 weeks. Agreement has been concluded with the Department of Finance whereby a special arrangement is made with existing testers to employ retired testers to augment rapidly this figure and add to the number of tests being carried out. I am confident I can put a hole in that backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The reason I am telling the Deputy this is that I want to keep the pressure on to make this happen. All the people I need to conduct these  reforms are currently up to their necks in this. I want to make substantial progress in this area and I will then move rapidly in relation to provisional licences. It is not satisfactory to have so many people relying long-term on provisional licences – some 358,845 as of April this year, which is not satisfactory.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">Will the Minister appoint additional testers – I know he is bringing back retired testers – given that there are qualified testers in other areas such as the Garda, FÁS, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and the Army? These people could be brought in on a temporary basis to try to relieve the current backlog and ensure people are accommodated with a driving test within a short time. Will the Minister give some outline of the type of transitional arrangements he is proposing to introduce towards the end of the year or early next year?</p>

          <p eId="para_536">We are having discussions with the trade unions in regard to additional staff and I hope we will have further discussions in that regard. I would like to employ additional testers if practicable. I do not want to bog down the system in trade union issues. My preference is to keep the pressure on and get the existing band of testers to do extra time at weekends. Overtime is now available as a result of the deal with the Department of Finance to bring back previous testers. We are making solid progress in this regard. A point should be made about waiting times for driving tests. If someone is going to take a course of lessons, get instruction, get a provisional licence and prepare for a test, it probably should take 16 weeks anyway. It should not be possible to decide on a Monday morning to become a driver, fill in some forms, do a test on Friday and be called a driver having managed to get through the test. In any case it is reasonable to expect someone to prepare for the test over a period of weeks and not just happen to be lucky on one day with a test. In that regard a couple of months is eminently reasonable. A person would not do a leaving certificate examination at short notice, but would put a few weeks into it.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">If that is the case, perhaps the Minister will introduce a syllabus. People would not do a leaving certificate examination without a syllabus and would certainly not do so if 50% of the people sitting leaving certificate examinations failed them, which is the case at the moment with the driving test. They would not do leaving certificate examinations if those in one part of the country had a pass rate of 55% and those in another part of the country had a pass rate of 35%. Does the Minister agree that the system has broken down because of the discrepancies that exist? Will he ensure that in the short term we will see the implementation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the driving test system and that we will see an overhaul of the  system that will deliver a quality trained applicant at the end of the process?</p>

      the implications for Irish aviation, and particularly for Shannon Airport, of the decision of the EU Transport Council on 5 June 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 98, 129, 133 and 151 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">As I stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 10 June 2003, the question of giving a mandate to the European Commission to negotiate an air transport agreement with the USA was agreed at the Transport Council on 5 June  2003. When deciding what position I should adopt at that Council on behalf of Ireland, the main issues that I took into account were the ruling of the European Court of Justice last November, the impact on Shannon Airport and its hinterland, the impact on tourism of increased access to Ireland, the opportunities for Aer Lingus to increase its business on transatlantic routes, the possibilities for other Irish airports which currently do not have scheduled services to destinations in the US, as well as Ireland's wider relationship with Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">A major factor regarding Shannon is that an EU-US liberalised market is the inevitable outcome of this whole process in Europe. It became very clear before the Council meeting that there was a consensus among other member states that an EU-US agreement was the way forward. In view of that reality, I took the view that to seek to insist on a non-open skies policy would damage not only Irish tourism, business and aviation as a whole, but also the potential for Shannon Airport to carve out new routes into the US in this new and liberalised market, and to develop itself as a hub for passengers and cargo.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">At the Transport Council, I stated that I would not oppose the wish of all the other member states to grant this mandate to the Commission to negotiate an EU-US agreement. However, I also reiterated my concerns about the impact an agreement might have on Shannon Airport, and I pointed out strongly that I will carefully assess the draft agreement, which ultimately emerges from those negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">We must take a proactive approach to these new realities and opportunities. My objective is to seek to ensure that in any new scenario Shannon has an equal or greater volume of aviation business available to it. I will engage with all the necessary interests to bring that about.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Breen:</from>
          <p eId="para_552">The Department seems to be giving different answers to various issues here. On 4 March, the Minister told me that no contacts had been made between Ireland and the US on the bilateral agreement. On 10 June, in a response to my colleague, Deputy Killeen, the Minister said that contact had been made on 28 May and a range of issues was discussed. He believed he would ask his officials to contact the US authorities with a view to bilateral discussions. However, on the Adjournment debate on 11 June, the Minister said: "I should make it clear that my Department—"</p>

          <p eId="para_554">It made it clear that the Department had not engaged in any discussions with the US authorities on the current bilateral agreement. Based on discussions that took place and are about to take place, there is a view that the Minister is fast-tracking a change in the current bilateral agreement to facilitate Aer Lingus to  open new winter routes in September and October to San Francisco and Orlando from Dublin only. Is that the reason the Minister is about to open discussions with the US authorities?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I would like to clear up the question of discussions. There were discussions at the request of the US embassy before the Council meeting in Luxembourg to talk about the upcoming Council meetings and the situation at the time. There have also been discussions since. There are no negotiations on the bilateral agreement at present. It would be silly not to keep in touch and have discussions not only with the US authorities, but also with the European Commission to establish the position in regard to open skies over the next two years or so. It is estimated that the US-EU discussions will take about two years to complete. We must take a proactive approach to building up Shannon Airport, particularly over the next two years, to seek to attract new routes and any new business we can get. We are having discussions on those matters at the moment.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan:</from>
          <p eId="para_556">Is the Minister aware that senior EU officials told the Shannon workers' representative group and some MEPs that the current dual gateway of Shannon and Dublin would not interfere with either the competition rules of the EU or the discussions on open skies? Will the Minister give us an undertaking that he will not try to sell off Shannon in a separate negotiation with the US, rather that he will operate through the EU? In his initial reply, the Minister talked about the "inevitable outcome". Is the Minister aware that abolishing the dual gateway is not an inevitable outcome? That seems to be the clear opinion of EU officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Is the Minister aware that evidence suggests that in small EU countries where there is no regulation for incoming flights those flights come to only one destination, usually the capital? Is the Minister aware of the serious outcome for Shannon Airport and its hinterland if, of his own accord as opposed to what the EU might want to do, he argues for the abolition of the dual gateway status of Shannon and Dublin that exists at the moment?</p>

My only objective is to increase the volume of aviation business coming to Shannon Airport. We should not sit back and wait for some taxi type deregulation decision from a court.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_560">We should not wait for a decision to come down like the last decision that came  down from the European Court of Justice. We should use the time we have to be proactive in having discussions to see what is available and what new businesses we can build up and take it from there. To simply sit and do nothing until the EU takes a decision is not the way I want to go. I want to build up the business and make sure we get extra business. Some 40% of people coming from the US last year got off at Shannon Airport because they wanted to travel to the mid-west and the west. When the stopover rule changed from 100% to 50%, the number of people using Shannon Airport increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I have to be realistic and I urge the Deputy to do likewise. Open skies in the European Union meant just that – there are completely open skies in the European Union. Planes may fly where they wish and Governments do not tell them where to fly. We are now trying to do that between the United States and the EU. It would be dishonest of me to mislead the people of the mid-west by suggesting that somehow we can have open skies and closed skies at the same time. We cannot have both.</p>

Will the Minister ensure that when his negotiations are finished, this level of year-round, non-stop daily service to Shannon will continue by regulation or otherwise?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_564">I would certainly love to arrive at that situation. The Deputy is correct. It is not so much that the stop-over is the model particularly wanted by anyone. What is wanted is direct services to Shannon Airport. Given the number of people who disembark at Shannon, and the growing market, I am confident the numbers of people who will want to travel from the United States to the mid-west will be maintained, if not increased, because of the extra destinations which we will be able to bring on stream.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_566">If one is sitting in a boardroom in the United States, and one wishes to provide a service to Ireland, two services are necessary, which is not the case in any other country. If there is an item on the agenda in the boardroom in New York or Washington regarding a choice between flying to Ireland and France, it will be noted that one can land in one destination in France while two stops are required in Ireland. That is a harsh reality which we must continue to consider. What answer will one get to that sort of question? The solution for Shannon is along the lines that Deputy Killeen has been advocating. I agree 100% with him. We need daily non-stop services to Shannon, because people want to go  to Shannon. The stop-over solution is not the answer.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen:</from>
          <p eId="para_567">Deputies have been talking about the stop-over today. There is no such thing as a stop-over. There is the Shannon gateway and the Dublin gateway. We have direct services from Dublin to the US. We have them from Shannon. With the exception of the route to Baltimore, all others go through Shannon. I ask the Minister again if Aer Lingus has contacted him with a view to changing the current bilateral agreement to facilitate a new Orlando-San Francisco service direct from Dublin. That is what we have heard and it is very important.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Mr. Brennan:</from>
          <p eId="para_568">The straightforward answer is "yes". The contact with Aer Lingus was not unusual. We have had regular correspondence with Aer Lingus on these matters, going back to my predecessor in the Department and my predecessor's predecessors. The view of Aer Lingus has been consistent for many years. It wants to open new gateways. We currently have five gateways in the United States. Aer Lingus wants to open another five or six. The ones they want to open are fairly well known too. The company feels they cannot move on these matters given the present arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">That is just one thing to be taken into consideration. All this is not just about Aer Lingus. The important single issue is that it is incumbent on all of us, particularly me, to try to ensure that we have a very strong Shannon Airport maintaining a strong trans-Atlantic business with daily non-stop flights, as Deputy Killeen has suggested. I know the Deputies will support this view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen:</from>
          <p eId="para_570">What one has, one keeps until one gets something to replace it. Up until now, the current bilateral agreement has worked well for Shannon and Ireland. Some 80% of the Aer Lingus profits come from the trans-Atlantic business, most of it through Shannon. Any change in the current bilateral agreement would be detrimental to Shannon and to the west. If the Minister changes the agreement, he will be remembered for the damage done to the west. He should remember he is from the west, and prove himself so.</p>

There will always be a very strong trans-Atlantic business in Shannon, because 40% of people who came to Ireland last year disembarked in Shannon. That number will grow in the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_592">I welcome the Minister's earlier response to the points I had made concerning artists' living conditions. I am not asking him to turn this legislation into a social welfare Bill but he might consider the fact that, under section 10, the Minister can seek to confer other functions on the Arts Council. Section 10(1) states:</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Council and such other Minister of the Government (if any) as he or she considers appropriate, by order confer on the Council such additional functions connected with the functions for the time being of the Council as he or she thinks fit subject to such conditions (if any) as may be specified in the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It might well be that the living and working conditions of artists – and the circumstances in which they find themselves, as I have outlined in the debate – might well be a function that the Minister would want to give to the Arts Council. Writers, poets, concert pianists and other performers might reasonably look to the Arts Council as a body that speaks for their interests. As I have pointed out, most artists would not qualify for social housing on income grounds. In addition, one cannot register as an unemployed actor because one would be asked to accept a job as a lounge waiter or whatever. "Artist" is not accepted as a category of employment and so, for example, particular difficulties can arise for dancers who suffer from arthritis. Given artists' living and working conditions – and the way in which they are affected by the Social Welfare Bill, the Finance Bill and various promotional schemes – it is reasonable for them to expect that the Arts Council should speak on their behalf. Although I know we are discussing section 9, this may be an additional function that the Minister could con sider placing on the Arts Council in the context of section 10.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I tabled this amendment based on submissions that were made in response to the report entitled Towards a New Framework for the Arts, which was compiled by Theo Dorgan. The Minister referred to the origins of my own party so I would like to clarify where this amendment came from. In page 12, section 19, the Dorgan report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Nobody wants the Department entering into a specific relationship with the individual artist. This is most widely expressed in submissions calling for the maintenance of the arm's length relationship with the Arts Council, which are often predicated on guarding the individual artist and, to a lesser extent, arts organisations, against politically motivated proscription. The poet Paula Meehan expresses this point of view when she says, in submission no. 179: "No artist wants to feel they are a politician's pet, and no politician in her or his right mind would want an artist as a pet".</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The most important statement was made by Kieran Benson. As the report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_598">More gravely, Kieran Benson points out the horrific record in the 20th century of politicians subordinating art and artists for dark ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">It was in that context that I made my statement, and Benson obviously referred to regimes such as that in Nazi Germany. I was in no way pointing the finger at the Minister, however, but the last Arts Act was enacted in 1973 and the next 30 years could see major changes in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">As regards the reference to Blueshirts and our party, I might say that the Blueshirts lasted for one year and I doubt if they were involved in killing anybody. They were set up basically to protect free speech when Cumann na nGaedheal election rallies were being disrupted across the country. We saw an attempt to do something similar last night. The party originated some 80 years ago and it has made a major contribution to the arts. Recently, when I was undertaking some research on the party's history, I found that it has approved Amhrán na bhFiann as our national anthem. The former leader of the Minister's party, Éamon de Valera, strategically adopted the line of that anthem to name his party Fianna Fáil. The origins of our party are clear and we have made a positive contribution to the arts over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I have based this amendment on those submissions that were made to the Dorgan report; it is not just something I thought up by myself. While I know the Minister will not accept the amendment, this provision could in future be exploited by an individual Minister or a Government in order to change that arm's length relationship that has always been accepted between the Arts Council and any Minister or Government.</p>

Higgins asked me to confer on the Arts Council because that is not its function. The question of entitlements for people who are involved in the arts is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and, as such, has to be dealt with by that Department. Their applications must be dealt with in the same way as any other citizen's application.

It will reverse the long-held arm's length approach which was paramount to the existence of the Arts Council. When the first Act was introduced in 1951, the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, insisted that the President must appoint the chairman of the Arts Council. I will move an amendment shortly to ensure that distance is maintained. This provision will change that. It is an undesirable change in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">Deputies Deenihan and Wall raised on Committee Stage the issue of increasing the size of the council. Having carefully reflected on it, I believe their suggestion makes sense. Accordingly, amendment No. 24 will increase the size of the council from eight to 12 ordinary members. I would also like to propose further technical amendments which arise as a direct consequence of the amendment to increase the number of ordinary members on the Arts Council. These will adjust section 11(5) and 11(6) of the Bill to take account of the increase in the size of the council. Section 11(5) will be amended as follows: In page 8, line 1, to delete "4" and substitute "6". Section 11(6) will be amended as follows: In page 8, line 4, to delete "4" and substitute "6" and in page 8, line 5, to delete "4" and substitute "6".</p>
          <p eId="para_608">As regards amendments Nos. 25 and 26, I indicated on Committee Stage that it is my belief that the best people must serve on the Arts Council and that it must be open to the Minister of the  day to make the right choices in that context. The proposed amendments suggest that membership should include representation from Northern Ireland or other regions or from particular art forms. I do not believe that is the best way to proceed in the future. The Arts Council and all its members must have as their focus the arts as a whole in all its form throughout all the country. It is more a question of choosing the right members who can take such a balanced approach to ensure that everyone is represented, which is not possible anyway. Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall:</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the number on the Arts Council from eight to 12. That will give the council a better balance and will cover a wider range of persons and groups interested in the different art forms. I understand the logic behind the Minister's argument not to accept the other amendments. It will be a difficult task for any Minister to appoint a board with many vested interests. As we know from the representations we received on this Bill, the Arts Council probably has the widest vested interests. I would not like to be in the Minister's position of trying to form a board which meets all the demands of the representative associations and the individuals who contacted us. However, I am sure the Minister will do everything he can to facilitate all the groups and to ensure a balanced Arts Council. It is imperative that we use the opportunity of a new Bill and a new board to ensure as wide a representation on the board as possible. The members of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann contacted us to ensure that someone from that area of the arts is represented on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">As regards the boards and councils of organisations to which the Minister must appoint members, it is important that we consider employees in the stated area of interest. There is a wide range of people employed in the arts throughout the country, such as the arts officers in local authorities. I hope consideration will be given to employees when the Minister constitutes a new board. I hope the representation is as wide-ranging as possible. We have increased the number on the board to facilitate that and to give the board a better balance. I am sure the Minister will reflect on what we have said about the constitution of the board.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_611">I thank the Minister for accepting the suggestions made by Deputy Wall and me on Committee Stage to increase the numbers on the Arts Council. I made the proposal in the context of securing an additional standing committee. The people the Minister chooses to be on the new Arts Council must encompass the broad definition of the arts, including the visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, cinema, circus and architecture. I hope it will be representative. I realise there is a large number of  diverse groups representing the performing and visual arts. Judging by the way the Minister chose the board of Fáilte Ireland, which was a fair selection, I am sure he will ensure balance in his selection for the new Arts Council. Both Deputy Wall and I helped the Minister in his decision. It would have been difficult if he had to choose eight instead of 12 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">As regards my amendment about regional representation, I remember at one stage it was said that there was no representative on the Arts Council south of a line between Dublin and Galway. Regional representation and balance will be important. As I said this morning when I pressed the amendment on the role of local authorities in the context of this Bill, there are many blackspots in this country in terms of provision for the arts. People are deprived of basic contact with the arts. They do not have an opportunity to view an exhibition unless they travel to major urban areas such as Dublin. They never witness the arts in their own communities. The only way that can be done is through local authorities. However, there could also be a fair and reasonable geographical distribution of members on the Arts Council in order that all of them would not be Dublin-based. The council should represent all parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I welcome the increase in the number of members to 12. It is important that the appointees should have vast experience and expertise in the areas I outlined. They should be the best people for the job and should not be appointed on the basis of political affiliation. They should also be independent and have the interest of the arts at heart and should not be on the council solely to represent the views of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Over the years, great people have served on successive Arts Councils. They were strong, independent voices for the arts in Ireland and that is why the arts have flourished. I will not mention names because there are too many but I urge the Minister to continue that tradition of appointments by successive Governments.</p>

I am glad the membership has not been increased to the high number of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">With regard to amendment No. 26, on the day we are taking parochial influences out of the health service, we should not seek to include them in this legislation. The Minister has made the point well that the people appointed to the council should be the best in their speciality arts field or have a wide knowledge of the arts. Geography should not influence the appointments. This point also applies to amendment No.  28 in that it should not necessarily be a requirement that the members should speak Irish.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue:</from>
          <p eId="para_619">Each member of the council may well represent one or two disciplines but it is of immense importance, irrespective of which discipline or region the individual represents, that he or she should make a constructive contribution across the broad spectrum of the arts. I neither need nor want people to have a narrow focus. If I were to engage in the process of appointing people from the regions, it would be implicit that the people concerned would be expected to represent the regions and that would be unsatisfactory. In the same way, if people are appointed to represent certain disciplines, there would be a failure to address the arts sector in its entirety and diversity. I expect that members of the council should realise this. The entire sector requires assistance from the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">It is also of immense importance that the membership of the council should not be introspective. It is important that the new council should look outwards at the broader world stage and glean experience in that regard. The appointment of the council is of immense importance and we must be extremely careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I can be certain of one point. The question of an individual's political affiliation will not decide whether he or she will be on the Arts Council. If I were to embark on that course, I would do a grave disservice to the council and the sector. That is something I will not do. However, a number of people who deserve to be on the council will not be appointed because of the surplus of talent available. There is provision in the legislation in regard to a roll-over, which can be usefully used by future Ministers.</p>

I agree with him regarding his approach towards the appointment of the new council and the need for its members to be outward looking and to take a broad, all-embracing view of the arts. I welcome the Minister's reply and endorse the sentiments he expressed regarding membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">With regard to my amendment, it is probable that not all the council members will be from Dublin and that there will be regional representation. This is important because some decisions will involve the disbursement of funds throughout  the State, for example, to professional theatre groups in Cork and Galway that will compete for funding. That is where regional representation could be important. The membership will, naturally, represent the regions and satisfy the purpose of the amendment in any case.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">(<i>c</i>) A representative from Northern Ireland should sit on the Council as an ordinary member.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I referred to this issue earlier in regard to the appointment of the chairperson of the council. The first Arts Bill was introduced by the Taoiseach of the day, John A. Costello, and he gave the responsibility to appoint the chairperson of the Arts Council to the President to ensure the appointment was kept outside politics. That philosophy has run through most of my contributions on Second and Committee Stages, but obviously that has changed. I moved that amendment on Committee Stage but the Minister did not accept it. I am in favour of maintaining an arm's length approach between Government and the Arts Council. It would be appropriate that the Pres ident appoint the chairperson of the council and that the members of the council be appointed by the Minister. I accept that all State boards are under the control of a particular Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I am most anxious about paragraph c) of my amendment which proposes that "a representative from Northern Ireland should sit on the Council as an ordinary member". I say this in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the developments that have taken place on this island since. The more communication we can have between agencies, Departments and State boards, North and South, the better for future relationships on this island. This is true of sport as well as every other aspect of life. I was delighted last evening to be involved in a very important sporting event between the Oireachtas and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This was a very successful event and although it was only a game, in a small way it helped to bring about greater understanding of the PSNI, which is the police force of the future in Northern Ireland, although some people may have difficulty with that idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The two Arts Councils have been co-operating on arts development on the island of Ireland since the 1960s and that has been intensified since the Good Friday Agreement. The two councils have granted joint funding to a wide range of arts organisations and programme supports North and South. They have worked together to get more funding for cross-Border initiatives and for initiatives on both sides of the Border, and they have done so very effectively. The Arts Council on this side of the Border has not received sufficient credit for the very successful initiatives it pursued with the Arts Council in Northern Ireland. Aosdána, which was established by the Arts Council with a membership of approximately 150 artists, has members from North and South. Under the Good Friday Agreement the way is open to look for a new level of co-operation for mutual advantage across the arts communities North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Although it is not a requirement, it is the practice to appoint a prominent person from Northern Ireland to the Seanad. At present Senator Maurice Hayes is making a major contribution to politics. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment if it is technically possible. The parliamentary counsel or the Minister's officials may have reasons it cannot be done but I believe it would send out an important message about the level of co-operation which is intensifying between both Arts Councils and among diverse organisations throughout Northern Ireland and the Republic. This would be an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">A large number of twinning arrangements are in place between towns North and South of the Border. I am involved in one between Downpatrick and Listowel which is proving to be very effective. Much of the co-operation between the towns is in the areas of the arts, heritage and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">From my experience and from what is hap pening with Aosdána and between the two Arts Councils in sourcing funding, aside from the Ireland Funds, the International Fund for Ireland, INTERREG and other funding sources, I am convinced that having a permanent member on the new Arts Council from Northern Ireland would be a very helpful and positive move. It would ensure that people would be aware of what is happening in both councils and that both councils would be familiar with developments on both sides of the island. I hope the Minister views this amendment in a positive way.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh:</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I had originally hoped to submit amendment No. 28 as two separate amendments because it consists of two distinct parts. One part concerns the Irish language and the other relates to the terms of office of the chairperson of the new Arts Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The Bill does not specify the period of office of the chairperson or whether he is eligible for reappointment or may serve as an ordinary member when he has completed his time as chairperson. During the Committee State debate the Minister said he would welcome Members' views on this matter. I had hoped the Minister would have included guidelines or criteria to allow the Arts Council, as the newest State board, to set the standard which other State boards might follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The amendment proposes that the chairperson may be appointed for two consecutive terms of four years and no longer. This would prevent a chairperson building up a fiefdom or making the Arts Council his hobby-horse. Changes in personnel would allow for fresh thinking and creativity, something which is needed in arts policy. It would also ensure that the chairperson of the council would not become stuck in a rut or develop a bias. There is also the danger that a board would merely manage or administer the arts rather than encourage creativity and develop policy, as is set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The Minister may reply that the chairperson's term of office is five years. However section 11(4) states: "Subject to subsection (5), the ordinary members of the Council shall hold office for 5 years from the date of their appointment." However, subsection 11(1) distinguishes the chairperson from the ordinary members. The period of office of the chairperson is not specified in the section. I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of my amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The first subsection of my amendment refers to a requirement that members of the council should be sufficiently fluent in Irish and English to enable the council to perform its functions through the medium of either official language. A Deputy has already said she would oppose such a requirement but I do not think it is unreasonable. Considering the current debate in the House on the Official Languages Bill and the fact that Irish is the first official language, this is the least we should expect of our board members. Some people might say that in this day and age this might be extreme, but I do not believe so.  Especially in the arts world, we should be setting a standard that would then be reflected afterwards in the rest of society, but especially in the rest of the State boards and Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I support the proposal from Deputy Deenihan that a representative from Northern Ireland should sit on the Council as an ordinary member. Having served in the Seanad with the late Gordon Wilson, I believe in the importance of the ability of people from Northern Ireland to assist and move forward policy down here reflective of their own place of residence, and this can be done. As Deputy Deenihan stated, it may not be possible to provide for it in the legislation but perhaps the Minister would give an indication that where there is an equality of ability and interest in developing the arts, we could look at appointing someone from Northern Ireland. This would move forward the process of integration between North and South. It is of vital importance that this should be so, especially in the arts with a new Arts Council going forward with new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I would ask the Minister that he would give a commitment, where there is an equality of ability and interest in relation to the members, that if it is possible he would appoint someone from Northern Ireland to the new Arts Council, which obviously will be appointed upon the enactment of this legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue:</from>
          <p eId="para_649">On amendment No. 27, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to involve the President in the appointment of the chair of the Arts Council. I have already explained that I do not feel that it is the way to go to select members of the Arts Council on the basis of where they come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">On amendment No. 28, I have explained that the best people must be available to the Minister, with as few constraints as possible. To stipulate that all members must be fluent in both Irish and English would impose an unnecessary restriction in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">This amendment proposes a maximum term of four years for the chairperson's term of office. The Bill as it stands stipulates five years, for the chairman, as for other members, and this is satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Bill as it stands allows the chair and members to be appointed for any number of terms of office, but not if two terms are consecutive. It specifies that anyone, whether an ordinary member of chair, who has severed two consecutive terms, may not be appointed again at any stage. This element of the amendment is thus already accommodated. The idea of a 24-month gap between two terms of office for an ordinary member would seem to be unnecessary, given the maximum of two consecutive terms that is allowed. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 27 and 28.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">There is little doubt that due deference to the Irish language is important, but it would not be  appropriate that members of the Arts Council should be fluent in Irish and English. I have explained on a number of occasions, that art finds expression in different languages, not necessarily in Irish and English. It is clear that some of the great writers of many generations have written in Spanish, French and other languages. We also must ensure that there is diversity on the Arts Council. A diverse Arts Council, which is broadly spread, is a healthy Arts Council. In that respect it is important to recognise what I was saying earlier, that I expect each member of the Arts Council to take an interest in the entire sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">There has been a practice in the past of appointing a representative from the North. Carlo Gebler is presently a member of the board of the council, Ciarán Carson has served a member of the council and there are many other such examples. While we should not legislate for representation from regions, I certainly am not excluding the possibility that somebody from Northern Ireland would be appointed to the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I am also aware of many arts projects which are currently jointly funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council. For example, the Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Monaghan is one such project that immediately comes to mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">It is obviously important that people who have a direct input, namely, artists, are on the council. I do not believe that all trappers wear fur hats and it is quite possible that somebody who is not an artist could end up on the council, provided of course that the person is deemed to have a sufficient knowledge and interest, and is capable of having an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">On more than one occasion today Deputy Deenihan has mentioned the first Taoiseach of the Republic – as opposed to the State – John A. Costello. I sincerely hope that when the Arts Council is bedded down I will receive the same epithet from those involved in the arts sector that John A. Costello once did. He was described as the honest broker to the claims of stronger men.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">To return to the question of the chairperson, as I said there is a distinction made in section 11 between a chairperson and an ordinary member, and section 11(4) gives the term of office for ordinary members – there is no mention in section 11 of the length of term of office of the chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">What I was trying to do – perhaps it was not what was acceptable to the Minister – was to set out a term of office to ensure that a chairperson could not hold office for more than two terms of four years. If someone wanted to be chairperson for five years that would be fine, but nobody should hold such a position for more than two terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In the last part of my amendment I wanted to provide that if a person held office for a period of eight years, the experience gained by that person would not be lost to the council, that she or he  could be brought back again after the lapse of 24 months.</p>

If the Minister will be appointing somebody from Northern Ireland, as he obviously will, while there would be a major time commitment involved if a person were on both councils, it would be desirable, if possible, that the person or persons he would be appointing from there would also be on the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">Given the number of people who contacted us regarding this Bill, I doubt that any other piece of legislation has been the subject of so many representations. All Members have received representations from various bodies within their constituencies. This shows the level of interest in this legislation but there will be no mechanism available to allow that interest to continue. Reports from the Arts Council will not be made available for discussion in this House. We should not allow that to happen as the House will lose its identity regarding some pieces of legislation. This Bill provides an ideal opportunity for the Minister to ensure that reports are laid before the House for discussion.

          <p eId="para_715">I explained on Committee Stage my reservations about the existing text of section 21 of the Bill. I did not believe that the Arts Council, the traditional arts or the arts in general would be served by ghettoising the traditional arts or by creating what might be seen as a council within a council. I also believe that art is dynamic and that its issues and priorities change from time to time. Policy must be able to respond to the dynamic nature of art and give special attention to the issues that merit it at any given time. It should adjust to changing realities. The Bill, as drafted, is clearly well-intentioned, but I have reached the conclusion that there is a better way.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The formulation I have devised, which is set out in amendment No. 38, allows the Minister of the day to require the Arts Council to establish special committees from time to time or to advise on any specified aspect of the arts. The council will have to take appropriate account of the advice of such a special committee. A maximum of three such special committees may be in existence at any one time. This new structure will allow priorities to be addressed as they develop, without the negative implications of a permanent standing committee structure. Among the first  priorities I intend to address through this mechanism is the traditional arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The amendment proposed by Deputy Deenihan to amendment No. 38, and amendment No. 39 in the name of Deputy Wall, appear to retain the approach of setting priorities in stone to a greater degree than I consider appropriate. Therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I am proposing amendment No. 40 and amendments Nos. 42 to 56, inclusive. These technical amendments flow directly from amendment No. 38, which replaced "standing committees" with "special committees".</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Deputy Wall's amendment No. 41 proposes that members of special committees be jointly nominated by the Minister and the Arts Council. I do not believe that this would be workable in practice and I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 38:<entity refersTo="#bill.2002.22.dail.4.amd_38.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_721">In the proposed new <i>section 21(1)(a),</i> after ‘special committee' on the sixth line, to insert “, one such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, matters of the arts in education, another such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, the traditional arts, and a third such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, the challenges facing the individual artist in Ireland”.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">This is an important section of the Bill and I am glad we have more than an hour to discuss it. The Minister shocked us on Committee Stage, in one sense, when he said he planned to re-examine section 21. I recall that I described his plans as "a seismic shift in policy", as the original proposal had been in gestation for about three or four years. Perhaps the Minister will specify the model on which the original standing committee proposal was based. Where did the idea come from? It is obvious that it was modelled on legislation from another country.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">These amendments give us an opportunity to discuss the role of the arts in education, the role of the traditional arts and the role of the individual artist, about which Deputy Michael D. Higgins spoke this morning. The wording of my amendment to amendment No. 38 gives a great deal of flexibility and openness to the Minister. I have proposed the insertion, after "special committee" on the sixth line of the Minister's amendment, of, "one such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, matters of the arts in education, another such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, the traditional arts, and a third such committee to consider, with reasonable frequency, the challenges facing the individual artist in Ireland". The use of the phrase "with reasonable frequency" leaves it open and flexible. The three strands I have included in my amendment need to be mentioned in this Bill in some way, for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I would like to elaborate on the importance of a special committee on education, with a brief reference to the background to this proposal. I will quote from some of the various reports into education and the arts over the last 60 years. In 1949, Dr. Thomas Bodkin produced a report that highlighted the fact that there was no art instruction in our primary and secondary schools and universities at the time. The 1962 Design in Ireland report came to the conclusion that the Irish schoolchild is visually and artistically among the most under-educated in Europe. In 1979, Ciarán Benson published The Place of the Arts in Irish Education, which contained 119 recommendations and was very critical of the education system at that time. Mr. Benson recommended that the Arts Council should build up a specialist education service and argued that the Minister for Education of the time should establish a consultative committee to monitor the progress made in developing the arts in education. I made a similar suggestion on Committee Stage, when I tried to justify the establishment of such a consultative committee. I am trying to justify it again by citing these examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">As part of Ireland's contribution to the European music year of 1985, the Arts Council published a report on the provision of music education in Irish schools. The report, Deaf Ears?, by Donald Herron, provided what the Arts Council described as detailed statistical evidence of the scandalous neglect of music in our schools. Only 2.9% of candidates for the leaving certificate in 1985 took the music examination and many of them studied for it outside of school. The Curriculum and Examinations Board's 1985 discussion paper, The Arts in Education, spoke of the indefensible neglect of arts in Irish education. In 1995, Frank Heneghan of the Dublin Institute of Technology initiated the music education national debate, MEND. The debate gave us a further insight into the state of music education in the primary sector and resulted in scathing criticism of what is happening in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Dr. Marie McCarthy, who is an expert in this area, published, Passing It On: The Transmission of Music in Irish Culture, in 1999. She made the point that the contradictory images of music in Irish culture bring to the surface many questions about the scope and nature of music education in Ireland. She argued that our fine reputation abroad is based primarily on traditional, popular and, to a lesser degree, classical musicians, whose musical education occurred, for the most part, outside the formal education system, in community settings, private music schools and certain universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">On Second Stage, I referred at length to the 2000 report of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, which clearly supports Dr. McCarthy's argument. If we look at the statistics in that report on music as a taught subject in second level education, an astounding 48% of single-sex boys' schools make no provision for  teaching music at junior certificate level. As if that was not bad enough, 74% of single-sex boys' schools do not offer music at leaving certificate level. These appalling figures are not replicated to the same degree in single-sex girls' schools where some 10% of these schools do not offer music at junior certificate level and 17% do not offer it at leaving certificate level. It shows that despite developments, there are still major deficiencies in our education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">To return to primary education, despite the aspirations in the new curriculum, music is not seen as a serious subject. In most cases it is used as a form of public relations exercise because it is regarded as a good thing for a school to teach music. The problem is that most teachers are not adequately trained to teach music. There is a great need for in-service training for teachers. There is also a need for a support system, something to which I previously referred in the context of physical education, where, in many cases, a teacher may circulate between a number of schools in an area. Such a system would also work in this context and it would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">In my home county of Kerry, which is also the home of the Minister, I understand there are only four schools doing music to leaving certificate level. This is indicative of a major deficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The PricewaterhouseCoopers' report stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_731">If we don't have some sort of decent arts education we won't identify the creators of the next generation, we won't identify the consumers, we won't find the people who will go out and buy books, who'll buy pictures, who'll go to concerts and the whole cycle is being impeded by this. So I think education is something which we absolutely have to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">However, teaching of music at leaving certificate level has improved to some extent. An article by Barra Boydell contained figures which indicated a significant increase in the numbers taking music at higher level; from 1,037 in 1998 to 2,893 in 2001. However, the article stated that, while the numbers have increased, the overall standard of students' entering music at third level has declined. That is an interesting observation.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">An emphasis on education runs right through the Arts Council report, the Arts Plan 2002-2006. The Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil adopted this as part of the programme for Government. It has probably already been abandoned, to some extent, because of the decrease in funding required to put it into practice. In one of the sections on art form objectives it was stated that despite recent advances formidable challenges remain. It stressed that there was almost no provision at primary or post primary level to develop people's understanding of architecture, for instance, which is now included in the definition of the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">There is also an absence of a positive promotion of dance within education which seriously restricts the development of dance infrastructure. Public knowledge and appreciation of dance is  low despite the large numbers taking part in a wide range of dance activities. Similar points were made in regard to education in respect of the visual arts and right across the spectrum. To ensure that the subject of the deficiency of arts in education will be covered it is important that the Minister demonstrates his intent by specifying that the focus of one of the committees will be education.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">As the Minister is aware, most of the lobbying for this Bill came from the traditional arts sector. Some 75% of all the correspondence I received is from that sector. It did not come from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann alone, but from many other elements of that diverse sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">As the Minister is also aware, there were major divisions within the traditional arts sector in respect of what approach to take. Some were against the notion of a standing committee in the arts with provision for making recommendations to the Arts Council and on funding, whereas Comhaltas, in particular, supported it. Both sides had valid points and strong arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">As someone who is involved in the traditional arts and who values the contribution they make to the community, I believe funding and support for the traditional arts must be changed. The traditional arts play an important role both culturally, educationally and economically. The Minister made this point on several occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Traditional arts must be properly funded but with the restraints on the Arts Council I do not know if it will be able to fulfil this role. It is not sufficient to say that a certain sum of money should be ring-fenced for that purpose because the provisions of this legislation prohibit it. The Arts Council cannot be directed on how funding is allocated. Will the Minister clarify that matter? Does it just refer to individual applications for grant aid or do the provisions in the Bill give the Minister the authority to direct the Arts Council to ring-fence x amount of its money for the traditional arts?</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I am aware that Comhaltas made a submission to the Minister seeking that it be treated as a unique entity, a form of national institution to be financed separately to the Arts Council. It asked that special provision be made for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I welcome the departure in the grants allocation of Bord Fáilte. Kenmare fleadh ceoil got a grant and some other fleadh ceoil in Kerry, I think it was Milltown, was also grant-aided. No doubt the Minister probably helped in some way. In the past fleadhanna ceoil across the country were generally ignored by national agencies. It was said they had access to other sources of funding which is not necessarily always the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The Dorgan report made clear that there was a view both inside and outside traditional arts circles that the Department has a role to play, at the very least in increasing supports for traditional arts. If it can be done by way of grant aid through local authorities or some other means, I suggest the Minister should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The other part of my amendment relates to the challenge facing individual artists in this country. Deputy Michael D. Higgins made a very strong case in that regard in his earlier contribution to this debate. Individual artists are the linchpin of creativity and innovation in the arts and hold a unique position within the arts infrastructure. A book entitled <i>The Creative Imperative</i> identified a wide range of specific problems facing individual artists. The report made 31 recommendations, many of which address the economic status of artists. It recommended substantial investment, not so much in direct subvention to artists as in the institutional infrastructure for the arts. That emphasis was reflected in many of the submissions we received on this Bill in terms of the obvious neglect of support for individual artists.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">A special committee should be established to review, on a regular basis, the problems facing individual artists, whether in relation to social welfare, to which Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred, housing or whatever. Reference was made earlier to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, who introduced tax-free status for artists. While that is very helpful, more is needed. Very few individual artists are making a good living out of the arts. Many actors are currently out of work as a result of cut-backs in many of the production companies and the discontinuation of tours. A number of centres around the country are either being forced to close their doors or are facing the threat of closure. Individual artists will suffer as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">There is an absence of work-space for individual artists throughout the country. Rental of accommodation is becoming very expensive. Provision should be made to make units available to artists free of charge as far as possible. I am currently involved in a project of that nature which is endeavouring to build units for artists and craft workers, to be provided free of charge to the individuals concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">To sum up, I believe my amendment will have no adverse effect on the shape of the Bill which the Minister has brought forward and I strongly urge him to accept it. If it is not accepted, I will put it to a vote as I believe its inclusion is critical to the Bill. I have been quite reasonable in relation to earlier amendments. This important amendment will give reassurance to the education sector, the traditional arts sector and individual artists that their needs will be catered for. I will press the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Mr. Wall:</from>
          <p eId="para_746">I ask the Minister to agree to these amendments. In an earlier reference to placing reports before the House and in the Oireachtas Library, I referred to a situation which one would hope will never arise in terms of the removal of a member of the board. In the overall context of the representations which have been made, some appropriate provision should be included in this Bill. Deputy Deenihan has already referred to many of the issues. Education is obviously a major factor in relation to development of the  arts. If that is not taken into account at primary and secondary level, we cannot expect to reap the rewards thereafter. The inclusion of a provision for the establishment of a special committee in that regard would demonstrate ongoing progress in the development of the arts in the educational system. That would represent a major enhancement of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">At a recent meeting which I attended with people from the various branches of the arts, there was general consensus on the importance of educational development. Many of the problems facing individual artists were outlined very eloquently by Deputy Michael D. Higgins in his earlier contribution to this debate. That impression of the realities of the situation is borne out by the many representations which I and other Deputies have received. We know about the problems being encountered by touring companies, including the major difficulty in relation to public liability insurance which makes it difficult for theatres and halls in towns and rural areas to open their doors, quite apart from the lack of funding for such tours. Some 17 such theatres were established during Deputy Higgins's term as Minister with responsibility for the arts. Many of them are no longer fulfilling their intended function in the development of the arts in rural areas because of funding problems and the dramatic increase in the cost of public liability insurance. In relation to the traditional arts, there should be provision in this Bill to take account of those problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The wide-ranging representations we received were not only from within Ireland but also from interested groups in England and even America, who were concerned for the development of Irish arts. That concern should be reflected in the Bill before the House. Account should be taken of the work of local authorities, especially the county arts officers. While I am not referring to the present Minister, I am concerned that, on the basis of the existing legislation, future Ministers may not set up committees – they may just leave it to the Arts Council. I would strongly prefer to have provision in the Bill to ensure that committees are actually set up in relation to educational development and the promotion of the arts through local authorities. That would represent a move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">As public representatives, we should give a sense of direction, based on the representations made to us on this Bill at various stages up to recent days. We should show that we recognise the need for special committees in relation to the traditional Irish arts, local authorities and education. If the Minister accepts these amendments, we will have done a great day's work in terms of ensuring a future mechanism in which all representative bodies can go forward, with access to the relevant committees and the Arts Council. I hope the Minister will reflect on this and will agree to provide such committees, during the debate on the Bill here or in the Seanad.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FionnaOMalleyPD" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Ms F. O'Malley:</from>
          <p eId="para_750">I applaud the Minister in his magnanimity and generosity in incorporating so many amendments, particularly those from the Opposition. Of all the amendments tabled, the amendment to section 21 is the most important. I recall that the majority of members' contributions on Committee Stage to this section related to the section, as initiated, being far too strictured. Given that inexperience has been reflected in the Statute Book for 30 years, when examining this legislation it was necessary that there would be a high degree of flexibility in the legislative framework through which all the arts would operate. I note people are rowing back from that. The Minister deserves credit for the amendment he tabled, which provides for the issues on which the previous two Members focused, which it is recognised require attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Those two Members would probably agree that it is not in the interests of the arts generally for specific provision for them to be included in legislation. The flexibility now provided by the amendment is a much better solution. When the issue of the traditional arts, and arts and education, which is possibly an ongoing and longer term issue, is dealt with in the near future, there will not be a need for a standing committee specific to those subjects going forward. That is why this amendment is important. Section 21, as initiated, was somewhat damaging because it was not sufficiently flexible. All of us have recognised that Acts must be flexible, and have the capacity to cope with change.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Amendment No. 38 (1) (<i>b</i>) is ambiguous. It states “The number of special committees standing established, for the time being, shall not exceed 3.”  What is meant by the words “for the time being” and to what extent is there scope for that number to be extended? I do not understand the necessity for the inclusion of those words. The Minister might consider deleting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">It appears the standing committees would be under the direction of the Minister. To what extent has the Arts Council the scope to establish special committees or would the establishment of such committees have to come under the direction of the Minister?</p>
          <p eId="para_754">It is well documented how much attention and energy was devoted to the debate on this section. I am glad a good solution has been arrived at. It will stand to all art forms, particularly the traditional arts. It would not do them any service to be sidelined and come under the remit of a subcommittee of a council. It is much better that flexibility is maintained. I applaud the Minister in arriving at this solution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_430" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Cecilia Keaveney:</from>
          <p eId="para_755">Having been in the Chair for most the debate on this Bill, I am glad to be able to speak on it and declare the interest I have in this area. I have a BMus, MPhil, Lpcl, Pgcl and four grade eights. I have gone through the system in terms of music facilities and I am aware of where the deficiencies are in the facilities, particularly in relation to music arts. In terms of the  traditional arts, I can play the reel, jig or hornpipe as good as anybody. I acknowledge the special role the traditional arts play in many aspects of Irish life and I understand the request made in regard to the original Bill that they be given a special status.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Minister's has moved towards the establishment of a maximum of three committees, although I would not have put a figure on the number of subcommittees because the same people would not be involved in the subcommittees. We could also branch out from that number without putting a finite figure on the numbers of subcommittees in place. I am concerned that the subcommittees would have teeth. I am looking forward to a time when the arts can have a cross-departmental Estimate. Arts and sport work together at present because they are under the remit of the Minister but, as all Members who contributed have said, there is a strong interaction between the arts and education. Officials of the Arts Council might talk to officials in the Department of Education and Children, but until that is backed by funding, it is only talk. The subcommittees must have a finite amount of time to discuss a particular aspect of a problem. Unlike the chairperson and the Members here not being able to contribute following two consecutive contributions, it should be possible to return to any issue as often as is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I do not agree with Deputy Deenihan about putting names on those three subcommittees. I could speak all day on the issues they could examine such as access to music for those with disabilities, music therapy and education, but where would one start and end? There is a gap in that area which would take up a good deal of the time of a subcommittee. There is also the issues of local authorities, performers and the traditional arts. There is the issue of what is being done in this area in Northern Ireland and what are we doing here, which in itself could be the subject of the work of a subcommittee.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">An issue I would like to pursue is the provision of arts for those in the 0 to 5 year old age group and how the arts impinge on their personal development. I would like the issue of the exposure of the arts to children to be explored. I mean the basic arts of a mother singing to a child, asking a child to clap or getting a child to interact to help the child's physical development and to progress the child's rhythmic and co-ordination development. I have studies which examine the issue of juvenile delinquency and how it can be tackled through the use of the arts. I could spend from tonight until tomorrow morning putting titles on issues that the subcommittees could examine, but the danger of doing that is that one would restrict the potential of these subcommittees.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">It is important that these subcommittees shall be established, that they shall have teeth and that they shall interact in a meaningful way with other Departments or with those people who are  involved in the particular subject. Instead of having a glossy report that we can put on a shelf – we will have a number of those from the deliberations of our committee – I would prefer to have action. Much action could take place in terms of the arts in Ireland. Many issues could be addressed and need to be addressed. We have some very good artists and they have come through despite the system in many cases and with the help of the system in other cases. I could identify a fair number of gaps if the Minister is stuck for titles for the subcommittees, but the important point is that they should be given the necessary powers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_431">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh:</from>
          <p eId="para_760">The original section 21 was a reflection of the scandalous neglect of the traditional arts. An attempt was made to eradicate the perception of elitism in terms of funding from the Arts Council in its previous existence up to whenever the provisions of this Bill will come into effect and the frustration that was expressed by those involved in that traditional arts, especially. They raised the lack of funding for many years and there did not seem to be the political will to tackle it. We have before us a Bill which intends to tackle this problem and even with the change the Minister is proposing, judging from the debates here and in committee, the political will seems to exist to ensure that the bias that existed in terms of funding is removed. The bias towards bureaucracy in the arts is also dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I did not agree with the initial idea of a standing committee because I thought it was not sufficient to replace one bias with another, which is what would have happened. The only section of the arts which could make a recommendation in terms of funding under the existing Bill was the traditional arts and that was wrong. We need some kind of guarantee that the Arts Council will address these deficiencies and the basic discrimination against the traditional arts. Deputy Deenihan's formulation would have ensured that this would happen. It is a pity the Minister's amendment did not come to us on Committee Stage because we could have thrashed it out properly and come up with the best possible wording. We could have dealt with the points that were raised, such as whether there are to be three or five committees or whether there should be a maximum term for these committees. No term is mentioned, so we could have a committee existing until kingdom come.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The Minister's amendment and that of Deputy Deenihan should ensure that the special committees will mend some of the rifts that have developed among the traditional arts and artists and that we manage to address the issue of how traditional and contemporary arts can co-exist and interact. When we were dealing with this last month, one of the Deputies who contributed mentioned "Riverdance" which is an example of the interaction of contemporary and traditional arts. It does not fall solely into the traditional arts  category; if one were to say to some people that it did, they would frown.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The terms of the committees are not restricted to any one topic in Deputy Deenihan's proposal. It allows for those committees to deal with a number of issues but provides that once in a while they must come back to addressing the two or three issues mentioned – the arts in education, the traditional arts and the artist. If this amendment is accepted, it will result in the only mention of the artist in the entire Arts Bill. I do not know whether this says anything about the future Arts Council, but I hope it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">My amendment, which the Minister is backing, seeks to ensure that no standing committee alone would have power over funding. One standing committee should not have this power; if anything, all three should have it. I ask the Minister to accept Deputy Deenihan's amendment because it would at least ensure that in the future the traditional arts will not be sidelined and receive only 1% of the funding, which was all they enjoyed until now from the Arts Council. If the traditional arts are mentioned in the Bill and associated with a special committee, the Arts Council will have a responsibility to listen and take heed of the views of those in the traditional arts and this would be reflected in the funding it grants. If no mention is made of the traditional arts things could be different. We must remember that the Arts Council is politically appointed. I am not saying that the Minister would be responsible for this, but a future Arts Council might restart the neglect of the traditional arts which has occurred over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_432" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue:</from>
          <p eId="para_765">After what Deputy Ó Snodaigh said earlier I became concerned that there might be a slight gap in the legislation, and the chief parliamentary counsel confirmed this. On that basis I will be proposing to insert, in page 7, line 44 of the Bill, the words "and the chairperson" after "members". This is to ensure the Bill does what I always intended it to do, which is to limit the chairperson's term of office to two consecutive five-year terms. I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for bringing this matter to our attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">In reply to Deputy O'Malley's point, the words "for the time being" mean "currently." The Minister will prescribe the period for which the committee will sit. Various suggestions have been made on what the committees should deal with. One commitment I have given is that one of the committees will deal with the traditional arts. This is of immense importance. As I have consistently pointed out, I do not believe we have had a coherent policy on the traditional arts or that they have been adequately funded. Obviously, the new committee will be charged with formulating a policy for the traditional arts, but the implementation of the policy will be a matter for the Arts Council. I have also stated consistently that funding from the Arts Council will be entirely independent of the Minister of the day. This is to pre serve the arm's length principle and to ensure the independence of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">It is appropriate for me to say at this point that in 1934 Daniel Corkery, who was dissatisfied with post-colonial literature in English and felt that it did not reflect his Ireland, pointed an accusing finger at the crowd attending the Munster hurling final and asked who spoke for the people there. In subsequent years the Abbey Theatre spoke for them, but it would be remiss of me not to mention that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann spoke for them and continues to speak for them today, together with other people involved in the traditional arts. I must say how impressed I was, on a recent visit to Brú Ború in Cashel, County Tipperary, by the cultural experience, which has to be seen to be believed.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">The contribution of Comhaltas is something that should be acknowledged by everybody in this House and I, for one, readily acknowledge it. I regard the traditional arts as a gentle flower to be nurtured, which should not be transplanted to any dark part of the garden. It is in that context that I have proposed that we should set up a committee for a specified period to formulate a policy for the traditional arts, which will be handed to the Arts Council for implementation. I hope this measure will resolve the difficulties experienced by the traditional arts. I have no doubt but that the traditional arts will have the goodwill of the Arts Council – its director, chairperson and members – but the question of funding will be a matter for the council. It is of immense importance that a coherent policy for the traditional arts arises from this proposal. The world is constantly in a state of flux. Since it is in a state of flux, there can be no doubt but that the arts world is in an even more accelerated state of flux. Therefore, it is of considerable importance to deal with issues as they arise. This cannot be done by having standing committees set in stone. It is of considerable importance that when issues arise there is a mechanism to deal with them. By providing in the legislation that the committees will be of limited duration and may change from time to time, we are inserting the kind of flexibility which will enable us to deal with these issues. This is something which will receive a general welcome in the arts sector, which is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">It is of immense importance also that there is freedom of choice for the Arts Council and artists. I do not think creative talent can be expressed if we impose rigidity or insist on matters being inscribed in stone, never to be washed away. Therefore, the measures undertaken in section 21 will be of ultimate assistance to the arts sector. I am strongly of the view that the provisions as drafted were extremely well intentioned. They were a clear recognition that the traditional arts did not have a coherent policy and that they were inadequately resourced. To that  extent the original proposals provoked a necessary debate inside and outside the House. The debate, through the contributions of Opposition spokespersons and others, including people outside the House, has been a constructive one. It has served the traditional arts well and the traditional arts will be the ultimate benefactors of that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">I express my appreciation to everyone who contributed to the debate which was conducted in good faith and in a civilised and constructive fashion. This is something which is appreciated by everyone with a knowledge of this area. We will proceed from here, I hope, in unison, not just in relation to the traditional arts but in relation to other art forms.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_772">I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I say to Deputies O'Malley and Keaveney that obviously they did not read my amendment. It will not limit a future Minister to any kind of straitjacket approach. There is sufficient flexibility within the amendment. I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for recognising that fact. The amendment I have proposed is a very sensible one.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Section 22 provides the council with the authority to establish committees. There is very little difference between sections 22 and 21. Section 22 states that the council may establish committees other than committees to which section 21 applies. Section 21 does not apply to any committee at the moment. It does not mention committees, therefore, there is a contradiction. Perhaps the Minister will consider this aspect in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Unless the issue of education is addressed now, I am convinced there will be more reports from the Arts Council on education in the years ahead. I am not confident the issue will be addressed  unless it is specified. The wording in my amendment gives the Minister flexibility to put in place these special committees with reasonable frequency.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">This is an important part of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">I know the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was not dealing with this issue before, so it is important to remind him that there is a difficulty with regard to the registration of opticians. Standards are obviously set so that unsuitable people would not be given registration. With regard to the requirement that a person who has not been declared bankrupt qualifies but somebody who has been declared bankrupt does not, there are problems with this requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">For example, if the Minister of State decided when he was young and foolish to set up a business, but it failed with the result he went bankrupt, then when he matured, as he has done, this error of judgment and youthful experiment would come back to haunt him if he wished to be a registered optician. This does not make any sense at all. If one is an undischarged bankrupt, it is a different matter entirely. The Bill, however, is not stating that, but instead it is stating if one "has been declared bankrupt". That is an important distinction.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I was advised by the Minister for Health and Children on Committee Stage that this was a requirement under EU regulations. My legal  adviser has informed me that this amendment would resolve that difficulty, and would ensure fairness and level the playing field. Without this amendment, a grave injustice could be done in the future. This is an important amendment that would deal with an issue that has not been thought out sufficiently by the parliamentary counsel.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">There are eminent advisers, but the Government has to proceed on the advice of the office of the parliamentary counsel. We sought the advice of the office since Committee Stage on this specific matter. Our legal advice is that the phrase "has not been declared bankrupt" mirrors the wording used in the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition on Professional Education and Training. We are obliged to mirror that wording in our legislation. I note that the amendment tabled by Deputy McManus seeks to clarify the meaning of "declared bankrupt". It is not necessarily the case that that is not implicit in the phrase "has not been declared bankrupt". There may be an issue of interpretation on that, but I am advised we still have to comply with the EU provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">If we accepted the amendment, it would create a different regime for optometrists and dispensing opticians whose qualifications had been obtained in the State or outside the European Union on the one hand and those qualified in other member states on the other. In the view of the advice of the parliamentary counsel that  would raise a difficulty in terms of our compliance with EU obligations. We would be introducing a requirement or a refinement into the definition of "bankruptcy" which does not exist in the other member states. In those circumstances, we could leave ourselves open to an issue of discrimination between different members states.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The Department of Education and Science advised that the Commission is looking at a process where it is consolidating the sectoral and general systems directives into one. We are advised that it is inappropriate to depart from the terminology used in the EU Directives. Under EU law there can be no differentiation in treatment or access to the profession between Irish nationals and EU nationals unless there are compelling grounds for same. If the requirement of Community Law includes disqualification based on the declaration of bankruptcy, then we have to maintain it as the consistent standard in this State as in other member states. Of course, the question of how that falls to be interpreted is not concluded by our enactment of the legislation in this form because its interpretation is a matter of EU law and, as I understand it, has not yet been determined by the EU law courts.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_450">
          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_803">This is very unsatisfactory and the ground is shifting all the time. Either the Minister of State is saying that if one is ever declared bankrupt one can never become a registered optometrist or he is not. I would have thought that we have the power to interpret what is being presented to us by way of EU directives or regulations. The Minister of State tells us that this would be in conflict with all the other EU member states but is that true and has he checked with all the other countries? Can he honestly tell me that someone who was declared bankrupt in their youth will still be prevented from being registered as an optician in any EU member state 20 years later? Is that correct? Is the Minister of State saying that where we have an opportunity to interpret in a reasonable way, we should not do so? The Minister of State knows well that in relation to any court decision, it is not what the Minister says that matters but what is actually enshrined in law. We have an obligation to address this matter now. Surely we are still a sovereign State?</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Minister of State can interpret this in a reasonable manner to ensure that unfair restrictions are not being put on people who were unable to avoid bankruptcy in an earlier period. It is wrong that this matter is not being addressed now. What is the Minister of State waiting for? Is he waiting for somebody to go to court? He is a barrister and obviously he has great faith in the courts but that is not really a solution for many people. It would be much better if we did it. The parliamentary counsel is always brought out of the cupboard whenever there is a difficulty. I am not even sure who the parliamentary counsel is but I know that the Bill could be improved by  this simple change. It is within the power of the Minister of State to do so and he is taking advice from the parliamentary counsel, which, in my view, is plainly silly.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">The terms of the directive are clear and our obligation as a sovereign State that has entered into international arrangements is to implement directives according to their terms. The terms of the directive require us to insert this particular qualification.

          <p eId="para_807">Our advice is to the contrary because the interpretation of that phrase is ultimately a question of EU law, not Irish law. It is an EU law requirement that we have this disqualification for optometrists. The question of whether the phrase captures only an undischarged bankrupt or extends beyond that is a matter that has to be left open. Were we, as legislators, to insert this additional and very specific clarification we would be departing from the uniformity of EU law, which the directive requires us to implement. As I understand it, that is the argument of the parliamentary counsel. We took advice from the parliamentary counsel on this issue in relation to the implementation – I prefer that word to "transposition"– of this directive into domestic law. Were I to accept Deputy McManus's amendment, in the context of EU member states, Ireland would have inserted an additional requirement into the directive. The legal advice is that it is not open to us to do that.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_822">In page 3, after line 31, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_823">"3.–The packaging of ‘ready-made reading spectacles' and any printed material attached to or accompanying such spectacles shall bear a warning in the following form:</p>
          <p eId="para_824">"Government Health Warning: "ready-readers" are recommended only as a temporary substitute for prescription spectacles. A sight test by a registered optometrist is advised.".</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I am glad of the opportunity to move this amendment. People require ready-readers, which is what they claim to be – ready-readers for people in a contingency. The trouble is, however, that people will use these ready-readers as an excuse not to have an eye test. There is a natural instinct to choose a stronger lens, like people taking extra paracetamol, so their eyes have to work harder. The public will be at risk because they do not know what they are getting. They do not understand that each eye has different defects. A product such as ready-readers, which is supposed to be ready for all, is not ready for anybody because it does not take into account the sight variation in our eyes, which have different requirements when there are sight defects.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The natural instinct is for people to pick a stronger lens just as people take extra paracetamol for a headache, frequently exceeding the recommended dose. It is human nature, but by getting a stronger lens their optical lens must work harder. They are getting a stronger prescription than they need. The lens's only function is to magnify but if people are getting something that makes an image larger, they think they have got a better product, which is not the case. That is the rock upon which people can perish. There is a wide range of lenses available, from 0.5 to six. I know the Bill does deal with a size six lens, but eye strain can and will result from such a lens, causing chronic headaches. One man's meat is another man's poison. People are getting headaches from something which could have been prevented. There is an onus on the Government in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The iris must accommodate, therefore it must work harder. I know the Cheann Comhairle is aware of the condition called astigmatism. Ready readers are not suitable for people with that condition. There are different vertical and horizontal measurements in the eye and the measurement is not the same around the cornea or the transparent covering of the eye. The lens may also be uneven. If there is more than one unit of difference between the vertical and the horizontal, the ready reader will not solve the problem. It is wrong and inappropriate to use the ready reader in that case. It might solve the vertical problem, but not the horizontal problem. It is difficult for someone with astigmatism to use contact lenses because of the different contours of the eye. People with good distance vision who do not have astigmatism or myopia find that their lens must work harder. That increases the need for stronger spectacles and the eyes must adapt to the stronger lens. The eyes, therefore, become more dependent on the glasses which must be used more often. It is like someone, who does not need spectacles, using them.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">There is something we can do about this. We must issue a warning so that people are aware of the dangers. There is more chance of eye strain or chronic headaches across the forehead and eyebrows that could be prevented if people knew  the reason for it. There is an onus on the Government to highlight that.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">It should also be pointed out that ready readers are not suitable for children. Children under seven years of age should not use ready readers because there is a danger of permanently damaging their sight. It is not appropriate for children to use them. However, if they are readily available, people, who are financially compromised, will use them. Many people who are on the bread line might use these glasses when their own break. However, it can result in amblyopia of disuse. In other words, the brain gets two different images, like someone with a turn in their eye or a strabismus, which is commonly called a squint. The brain ignores one image and that eye becomes useless. The same thing happens if one uses ready readers because they do not address the sight problems. It is possible the child could end up with amblyopia of disuse, in other words, a useless blind eye. Children under seven years of age must not use ready readers. However, they will not know that unless parents are warned about it. It is dangerous for children under seven years of age to use ready readers because they could permanently damage their sight. That is why I tabled these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">I support Deputy Cowley's amendments Nos. 3 and 4. I commend him not only for tabling them but for the informed case he presented. While I welcome the wider availability of ready made reading spectacles, there must be a balancing arrangement in terms of cautioning people about the consequences of long-term dependency and non-prescriptive use. The second amendment reflects on the issue of child dependency, although I note that Deputy Cowley mentioned children under seven years of age. I said on Second Stage that young people today, particularly young girls, regard spectacles as a fashion accessory. That is contrary to the way it was when I was growing up. Many of them wear spectacles with clear glass inserts rather than with lenses which correct eye problems. There is a need to signpost caution and to bring to the purchaser's attention, particularly to young people's attention, that this is not the panacea for all their concerns about disimproving eyesight. I support both of the amendments. The arguments presented are a credit to Deputy Cowley.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_469" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_831">As regards the proposed amendment, I appreciate the spirit with which it was tabled. However, it is not legally necessary to go down that route because the Medical Services Directive, 93/42/EEC, which was implemented into Irish law by Statutory Instrument 254 of 1994, deals with the issue of labelling. Under that directive, ready readers are classed as Class I medical devices. In practice, that means that ready readers must be CE marked by their manufacturers. The CE marking is the European wide recognised symbol for the safety, quality and per formance of medical devices. This marking indicates the safety of a device and a product carrying the CE marking may be placed on the European Union market without further restrictions. Under the directive, manufacturers of ready readers are obliged to supply information regarding the safe use of their product, taking account of the training and knowledge of potential users. The label must include any warnings and-or precautions to take. That is an existing legal requirement. Under the directive, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to provide this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">In Ireland a small number of outlets are currently selling ready readers. The Opticians Board has not taken action against them because deregulation is pending. In those pharmacies which sell ready readers, warning notices can be seen advising of the need for eye examinations. Such warnings must be given as a matter of professional regulation under the existing EU provisions. In the circumstances, an amendment to the effect that ready readers are not a substitute for eye examination is not required.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">It was originally proposed that the sale of ready readers should be subject to an age restriction. However, in June 1999 the Department was advised that the Opticians Board did not favour an age restriction as it would be unenforceable. The Department's chief medical officer advised that an age restriction was unnecessary. The decision to drop the age restriction related to the position in other European countries. A survey carried out in 1994 by the European Council of Optometry and Optics among the European Union member states, together with Norway and Switzerland, identified only three countries with restrictions on persons to whom ready readers can be sold. These were France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United Kingdom the sale of ready readers is restricted to persons over the age of 16 where the sale is wholly for the purpose of correcting, remedying or alleviating presbyopia. The United Kingdom Department of Health advised that when the relevant legislation was drafted, it was not intended that an age restriction would apply, but one was included when the Bill went to the House of Lords. The UK General Optical Council has advised that this provision is not policed by the council because there are so many outlets selling the glasses it would be impossible to prove whether the sale is wholly for the purpose of correcting, remedying or alleviating presbyopia.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Deputies should be aware that any amendment imposing a labelling requirement would render the Bill notifiable to the European Council under the directive on technical standards. This is because such a regulation would be considered a potential barrier to trade.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley:</from>
          <p eId="para_835">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I take the point about the directive. However, it states that CE marking is a symbol for the safety, quality and performance of a medical device. That is a contradiction. Given the  reasons for the amendment, how can it be a recognised symbol for safety, quality and performance? Just because something is done in one country in Europe does not make it right. I made the point that this country adopted the euro, but the United Kingdom did not. Who is wrong or right? What about the right to bodily integrity, which is a right under our Constitution? We have an obligation to protect the right of our citizens to bodily integrity. Surely that is the case here? What happens if someone gets the ready readers and a warning is not visible? There is an onus on the Government in that regard. We live in a litigious society. If an individual crashes his or her car, will the Government be subject to a law suit? Just because it is difficult to enforce does not mean it should not be done. This issue is about making the information available. While there is a legal obligation on the manufacturer to provide warnings and so on, the Government also has an important role.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">I agree with the Deputy that we live in a litigious country, but opticians and vested interests are also aware of that. That is the reason, as a matter of professional obligation, they display warning notices. The existing EU legislation together with professional practice based on it is sufficient. The relevant regulation states: "The label must bear certain particulars, including any warnings or precautions to take."  The matter is covered by EU law and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_492">
          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_866">Since last night I took some time off to think of excuses why the Government could be pardoned for letting the people down so badly and so sadly in the past 12 months. I tried to think of various reasons which they might be able to tender to the public for committing such an atrocity on people who were under their power, who were listening carefully to them and were under their guidance to such an extent that the unfortunate people were almost hypnotised in the run-up to the general election. Not a day nor an hour of a week went by from 1 January that there was not some item in the post explaining or implying how beneficial it would be to continue as we were. The mothers of Ireland received a promise in the post and then a cheque in the post just before the general election with a large sum of arrears. Recipients of various social welfare payments received arrears of payment to create a feeling of well-being and to create the impression that this would continue into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Various pundits have expressed surprise that the Opposition, the media and the European institutions did not do something about it. The European institutions had attempted to raise this issue two years previously. They had indicated that Government spending was going out of control. They had indicated well in advance that we were overstepping our guidelines. The Government at the time chose to ignore it and told the Europeans to get lost, that we would look after our own affairs, and so it continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">It was indicated by the leader of Fine Gael in the House this morning and on "Morning Ireland" that a certain Dublin hospital might have to treat patients in the car park of the hospital while at the same time hospital beds were closed inside the hospital. I know that we are capable of many great fairy tales in this country but how can it transpire that a year after a ten year plan for the health issue was unfolded and a few days after a new plan has been unfolded – which we have not seen yet but we will in due course – it is now being contemplated that patients may have to be treated in the hospital yard. This is extraordinary. In no other country that I know of, even in banana republics, does that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">One year ago, before the election, 200,000 extra medical cards were promised. Where are they now? They have vanished like last year's snow. They were never there anyway, like last year's snow.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The question of crime was to be addressed. Where are the 2,000 extra gardaí who were promised? Not a day nor a night, nor a week, goes by that there is not some major incident such as a stabbing, a gangland shooting or serious crime not being reported. Why is this so? Because the people no longer have confidence in the system. Just a year after all the hype and promise, why did that happen? Consider the damage done in the mind of the public. Consider the damage done to the confidence which the public has a  right to have in the institutions of State. Consider the CE schemes, some in health areas and others in education areas, and the provision of personal assistants. Where have these schemes gone? The confidence of the public has been shattered again. What did these people do wrong, if anything? Did they not vote the right way? Was there not a supposition a year ago that everything would continue as it was? Was there not every indication that things would continue as they were?</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I will not talk about the situation regarding carers because I know it must be very embarrassing for the Government. Clearly in regard to schools, there was an attempt to create in the public mind the impression that a vote in a particular direction would mean that the needs and aspirations would be met and people would be looked after. Specific information went from specific candidates and Deputies to individual parents' bodies and school management boards indicating what would happen. Nothing happened. The curtains were pulled down immediately after the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">There is one area where the Government emerges with flying colours. In the area of housing there was no promise, nothing was done for five years and nothing is being done. The public were not let down in that instance. It was quite clear that after five years of inaction the Government proposed another five years of the same, and it is not letting the people down. There are 47,000 families on a housing list. Hundreds of millions of euro are being spent on temporary accommodation. There are more homeless people in the city of Dublin than in the city of London. Suggestions are being made that if they were counted less often there would be fewer of them. This is crazy and I ask if it is a fairy tale.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">The Government or the country will reap the negative rewards of the housing policy now being pursued. It is an absolute disgrace that the younger generation is being deprived of a basic need such as a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I will conclude by saying that the people were conned. They were led astray, not for the first time, by a well-calculated strategy for which the plans were laid down in advance. The plans were put into effect and executed with military precision in 1977 and were repeated for a new generation 20 years later. I hope the Government is ashamed of what it did, because it should be.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch:</from>
          <p eId="para_875">I thank the Fine Gael Party for allowing me to speak for five minutes. We could all trot out our version of how the last election was fought by the Government, which, it has to be said, won handsomely. I do not think it is necessary to restate the litany of promises that were not delivered on, but one or two issues should be highlighted from a Cork city perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I would like to remind the Government Members who are present that the disabled person's grant was introduced by the Government so that persons with disabilities, particularly elderly people, could stay in their homes. We have all  heard the rhetoric. If one surveys the elderly, one will find that their preference is to stay in their own communities and homes. Certain adjustments need to be made to allow this to happen. Very few of us live in houses that will be suitable for us for our entire lives without needing to be adjusted. Some 100 homes in Cork city are on a list of houses that need to be adjusted and altered so that those living in them can continue to do so for at least another ten or 15 years. An elderly woman who is quite capable of living in her own home if certain adjustments are made is living in a nursing home, at huge expense to the State and her family, and cannot return home because the necessary adjustments have not been made. Some 100 such cases are found on Cork City Council's list and 250 people are waiting for prioritisation in that respect. The council has not issued an order to proceed with the necessary works since last October. It is an absolute disgrace that those whom the Government continues to tell us have benefited most under its reign are being hit hardest.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I am glad the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, is here tonight. As someone who lives in County Kerry, which is quite close to County Cork, he will know that Cork's application for city of culture status in 2005 contained very specific proposals. One of them related to the Cork School of Music, which was a central part of the application for the title of European City of Culture 2005. Everyone seems to have forgotten the St. Finbarr's Vision Centre, which was the other focus of the application. I do not want to use the argument that things do not happen if they are outside the pale—</p>

We can borrow to build the Cork School of Music – we are not precluded from doing so. I suggest that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent Cork city should inform the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who is here tonight, and the Minister for Finance that a school of music cannot operate from a hotel. One cannot renege on commitments one has made in order to attain a certain title. I suggest that the Deputies opposite take my advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">Debates in this House on economic and political policy are always welcome, particularly as they present the full kaleidoscope of fiscal fragmentation which shimmers from the Opposition benches. Such debates are also welcome because they focus public attention on the cost of promises made by Opposition parties. They give time to the Government to analyse the performance of the Opposition and to see if it measures up to its rhetoric. It is regrettable that the Opposition does not speak with one voice, advance one policy or present a coherent alternative. It is clear that there has not been discussion, let alone agreement, on an alternative economic policy which might be put before the people. Perhaps this is not surprising in the first year of a five-year Government, but it is disappointing. It is particularly disappointing to see the two  numerically large Opposition groupings – Fine Gael and the "Green Féin" alliance – so splintered on economic policy.</p>

A Government adopting any of the Green Party's stated initiatives in relation to the curtailment of the national development plan would inevitably lead to mass unemployment, economic stagnation and curtailment of essential services. This country needs Green Party economics like lettuce needs slugs. The same Green Party nihilists who oppose every economic initiative under the spurious banner of eco-liberal concern would visit mass poverty on this country. Its economic policies are as false and anti-people as its ethics are elastic and two-faced. Yet these icons of spurious propriety never miss an opportunity to haughtily harangue and hector the people whose policies have ended forced emigration, the people who have delivered the highest level of employment and job creation which this country has ever seen, those who, by their industry, initiative and labour, have built the economy of this country.</p>

The past ten days have taught the Irish electorate that Green ethics are for external application only. The Green Party sits comfortably on the Opposition benches with its allies in the "Green-Féin" alliance – Sinn Féin, a party well used to the economics of nihilism. No political grouping on this island has sought to foster economic devastation as a political weapon as comprehensively as Sinn Féin. There is something richly ironic in being lectured on job losses by a party whose political philosophy not alone condoned but encouraged the destruction of economic life on this island, but they have not gone away. What was started with the bomb they aim to continue through the ballot box. Revolutionary socialism of the type now proclaimed by Sinn Féin requires economic devastation to thrive. Its economic policies are designed to bring about that devastation. Its philosophy of spend, spend, spend, regardless of whose money it is, at least has the benefit of consistency. For the past 30 years many a hapless bank manager can attest to its implementation. It is a policy it shares with its not-so-revolutionary-these-days colleagues in the Labour Party. Its answer to every economic ill, every social issue, every societal challenge is to spend, spend, spend.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen:</from>
          <p eId="para_990">—to address some points which have arisen in this debate on the motion which has been put down by the Labour Party. I support the Government motion counteracting it. From what one can garner from the contributions of the sponsors of the motion that is before the House, they seek to promote their analysis on the basis that the Government was elected simply in respect of the commitments it made before the election. The Labour Party seeks to suggest that we have breached faith with the electorate since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">If one harks back to 12 months ago, the reality of the last election is that the people made a clear decision as to who had demonstrated an economic performance which was rewarded with the return of the same Government to office for the first time in 33 years. That was based on average annual GDP growth of 10%, an increase of 370,000 in the number at work and unparalleled prosperity. That was brought about, not only in a domestic and macro-economic policy framework embedded into the social partnership process and supported by the social partners, without whose commitment it would not have been successful, but also in a benign international economic environment in which we were, for the first time in many years, in a position to take up the economic advantages emerging from the type of policies we were pursuing. We followed responsible budgetary policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">People also supported the Government in the last election, having seen its performance over the previous five years on the basis that, for every budgetary statement we made, we were in a position to confirm, in the following year, that we had adhered to the strategy outlined in our annual Budget Statements. That demonstrated a level of competence in our economic management which differed from the experience of the previous incumbents and, perhaps, even previous Governments. That is the reason we have been re-elected to office, not solely but in the main.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">People asked what alternative there was to this Government, or if, indeed, there was a credible alternative. They saw the manifestos of the Fine Gael Party, which, obviously, would not have had an ambition to become a single party Government. They saw the manifestos of the Labour Party which was seeking to restore its fortunes to 1992 levels. They considered what the Green Party had to say in economic terms and they looked at the Sinn Féin Party. It was clear to the public there was no synergy available in the policy positions put forward by the parties in Opposition to suggest that the formulation of an alternative Government would, at the very minimum, maintain the level of economic competence which people ascribed to the Government, let alone any idea of an available alternative economic model, based on the manifesto commitments of the various parties, which would bring forward a coherent alternative Government programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">I reject the rather arrogant suggestion that the people are fools and can be conned. The people made the decision, based on their own discernment and experience and on the fact that, for very many people, the previous five years had brought unparalleled prosperity and progress in their individual, family, economic and community lives. That is the reason they voted for these parties, restoring this Government to office.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">While one can find many reasons for an informed economic debate, to which I look forward and welcome, we do not serve public discourse well by suggesting, as the leader of the Labour Party did last night, that the Government  has not got the moral authority to govern, or that it has, in some way, a flawed capacity, based on the electorate's decision. We must accept democratic decisions. It appears that some wish to continue an economic debate for the next four years on the basis of re-running an election campaign when the empirical facts are self-evident. Perhaps we will have another opportunity to go into the matter in greater detail – I do not wish to base my entire contribution to this debate on this issue alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">These parties in government went before the people on the basis of manifesto commitments which promised to spend less and tax less than the Opposition manifesto commitments, taken collectively or individually. Those are the facts on the basis of which the people have decided. This is confirmed in the social partnership agreements to which I ascribe the basis of our success. The social partners and the National Economic and Social Council subscribed to the economic model which we have devised for ourselves, based on responsible economic policy, social progress, social inclusion, a recognition that we must work together, having a tax system which incentivises and rewards entrepreneurship and business capacity and has benefited ordinary workers to a greater extent than ever before.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen:</from>
          <p eId="para_998">The economic model will not give an absolute imperative of delivery, given the nature of our economy. Ours is an open economy in a globalised world. Our country lives on its exports, depending on buoyancy elsewhere for those who buy our products and services if we are competitive and supply quality products. If we wish to make a living as a people and an economy, the international economic environment is, clearly, an important component in the success or failure of our ambitions. I believe all of us in this House wish to improve public services, to have the maximum number at work, to have a vibrant community life, economically, socially and culturally.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Let us have a debate on the model people may wish to adopt. I contend that there is a false ideological debate taking place. It is suggested that those who seek to tax less are, in some way, not committed to public services, by comparison with those who wish to tax more as an index of their commitment to developing public services. The facts are against those who want a high taxation rate, as I will explain. In 1996, the rainbow coalition Government was collecting €106 million in capital taxation, or 0.7% of total tax take. We reduced the rate of tax from 40% to 20%. Last year, 2002, we collected €628.2 million, an increase by a factor of five in that area alone. We are prepared to ensure we have a taxation regime which puts assets in the marketplace in a way which will bring back revenue to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I recall a contribution to a budget debate, prior to the last election, by former Deputy Derek  McDowell who was then Labour Party finance spokesperson in this House. He criticised the Government for failing to bring about total tax exemption for workers on the minimum wage – only 90% of such workers were tax exempt. He suggested we had focused on corporation tax and capital tax, to the neglect of those on low incomes. I had some respect for the former Deputy, who at least put forward a coherent analysis based on his own ideological approach. However, what he did not take into account was the effect of reducing those tax rates. In 1996, corporation tax constituted 11.4% of total tax revenue, or a total of £1,810 million. No doubt, the then Government would claim it was getting the maximum yield in that regard. In 2002, the tax take from corporation tax was €4,803 million or 16.4% of total tax revenue, as a result of our economic and fiscal policies of reducing corporation tax from 36% then to 12.5% in this year's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">If the argument is that we need to derive a greater contribution from the corporate sector or the capital tax sector, as part of our total tax revenue, the empirical evidence confirms that the way to do that is to provide the type of fiscal structure we have provided. Those are the facts. Having achieved a model which has derived far more, in volume and percentage terms, of capital taxation as a component of total tax take, it is totally fallacious to suggest that one should now double the tax rate by taking it back up to 40%. In the past, we already had that model of high tax rates and high borrowing which brought about generational emigration and endemic unemployment of a structural nature.</p>

If we are to have an economic debate, as we should, let us not come forward, as some of long experience in this House have done, with arguments suggesting we can throw out the Growth and Stability Pact, now that we are in the euro zone, that it does not have any relevance and that one can go ahead with billions of euro in borrowings.

          <p eId="para_1007">It is only fair to refer also to the  income tax changes we have made. The tax on labour in 1996, as a total percentage of tax take, was 36.6% and £5,818 million was collected. As a result of reducing tax rates to 40% and 20%, of having the best tax wedge for ordinary workers in terms of disposable income once revenue tax and PRSI were reduced, we collected €9,062 million in 2002. The total percentage of tax take on that tax on work is down to 30.9%. A reduction of tax on labour has brought 370,000 more people into the workforce. A reduction in corporation tax has increased the tax take by a factor of four in volume terms and by 50% in overall terms. A reduction in capital taxes has brought a greater contribution from capital taxes now than was the case in the past. Capital gains tax take as a percentage of the total tax take this year has increased fourfold over what it was in 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">If we are going to have a debate, let us have a debate on the facts. What we now know about the health service, if we are prepared to face up to it and we have responsibility to do so – we can debate the issue and disagree on aspects of it – is that if resources were the only requirement needed to bring about a European standard health service in this country, we would have the problem solved by now. If this or any other Government was to have increased the payment into the health service from €3.2 billion during my time in that Department to €9 billion which has been invested in it now and if money was the only issue, the problem would have been solved.

The Government and the Minister are determined to go forward based on what we have decided. We are determined to show our commitment to bring about the necessary reform so that everyone will have better access to the health service and that public service workers in the health service, who work hard, as I know having been a former Minister for Health, get the opportunity to deliver services in a way which makes more sense and which brings about a greater uniformity of service than we currently have.</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">The Government claims in its so-called progress report that the people gave it a mandate, "not for what we have done but for what we have yet to do". The reality is that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have secured their mandate for what they promised to do in 1997 and in 2002 and those promises were broken and have been broken yet again. The Government cannot disguise the broken pledges and the flawed policy decisions of the past year. It would like us to forget that it has been in office not for one year but for six. The Government has been in power for far too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">It began as the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition, but it rapidly evolved into the PD-FF Government with  the Progressive Democrats clearly the dominant element. It has become like the Tories in Britain after repeated terms in power. In their case it was the hard right led by Norman Tebbitt which set the agenda, in the case of this Government, the agenda is set by the Progressive Democrats with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, as the standard bearer of the right in Irish politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Deputy Cowen was right on one point he made before he left the Chamber. However, he showed little awareness of it when he was Minister for Health and Children. Fundamental reform of the health services is needed. In their six years in office, the parties in this Government have failed to act on that fact. Today's announcement of the so-called health service reform programme represents administrative change, not fundamental reform. While new bureaucratic structures are being set up, public patients will continue to suffer and sadly some will die on waiting lists. Hospital beds will remain closed and 200,000 people will be left without the medical card cover promised by the parties in Government in the run up to the last general election. The Fianna Fáil promise to end hospital waiting lists within two years has now been consigned to history. Neither the package announced today nor the national health strategy recognised the need to end the two-tier system – the health apartheid which ensures that private patients receive privileged access while public patients must wait. The real test will come when the Hanly report is published and the Government has to confront the disgraceful abuse of the public health system by the consultants. I see no sign that the Government is determined or prepared to take on this body. The ideological and policy direction of this Government is set by the Progressive Democrats. Fianna Fáil was once a party with a commitment to the central role of the State sector in the economy, to the provision of social housing and to upholding Irish neutrality. Those values have been shredded by the Progressive Democrats and their allies in the right wing of the Fianna Fáil leadership, chief among them the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. What do we have now? We have ideologically driven privatisation. That is the reality offered by Fianna Fáil today. Housing provision is totally reliant on the developers' drive for profit, regardless of social need, and we are seeing the destruction of Irish neutrality. The right wing agenda of this Government is set by the Progressive Democrats who have contributed to the ever-widening gap between rich and poor in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">There are a number of areas on which I could reflect: The failure of the Minister for Education and Science to follow through on the commitments made before the election; the cuts in the school retention initiative; the failure of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to follow through on its promises of increases in a whole raft of areas, including child benefit where it has failed by €8 per week to meet commitments  made in the past budget. That would be a substantial sum for those who depend on it. The Government has missed the targets set in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on the minimum welfare payment and there is no increase in back to school allowance for primary students. The child dependant allowance remains frozen since 1994. The programme for Government states: "We support the positive role of the community employment scheme to meet the needs of both the long-term unemployed and communities," but CE places were cut. It is to CE places that this Government should be confined.</p>

          <p eId="para_1044">There is no need to. As it stands, my party has not been guilty of any sins of commission – none of its members has committed illegal acts. Neither is it guilty of any sins of omission. We have not been dragged screaming to tribunals to release information that should have been released day by day on the floor of this House. We have perhaps not lived up to our own standards, but those standards are far, far beyond the place to which many people in Deputy Lenihan's party still have to travel. Ours is not the party of blank cheques, of meat and bone meal being fed illegally to animals, of creditor farmers, or of Liam Lawlor. The contribution of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism this evening suggests that the Government is floundering. It is not prepared to make positive statements about itself but only to strike out at others. It will grab hold of the most insignificant issue in an effort to reclaim some credibility from an  electorate that, as of now, is not prepared to give it anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The Minister engaged in the usual scare tactics about Green economics. My party was the only party in the last general election that predicted that we would have a growth rate of no less than 3%, which is incredibly irresponsible. My party was prepared to point out that this is the country with the lowest level of social protection expenditure in Europe, something in which the Government can take no pride. My party has been prepared to say that in the practice of government in other European countries there have been Green Party Ministers with responsibility not only for the environment but also for areas such as health and public services. In those countries, one can go into a casualty department and be treated in an appropriate time. One can go into a hospital and receive surgery within an appropriate time. One knows that if one is part of a society, even though one may not belong to the most cosseted, rewarded and wealthy sections, one will be treated no differently from anybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The Government holds up the present state of this country as some kind of economic miracle, something to which other countries might aspire. However, it has been a con-trick and the Government has run out of time. It benefited from international conditions that no longer exist and is now being asked to use its own resources to provide policies to benefit this country, an area in which it has been shown to be sadly wanting. The tragedy is that the Government will be in office for another four years, but during that time the Minister of State and his Government will be exposed to constant opposition in this House and on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Regardless of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has just said, no one has argued that the people were fooled. We will argue, however, as we have argued in the past, that this Government has acted and continues to act as if the people can be fooled. This is the saddest indictment of the Government. Come the time, to a certain extent next year in the local and European elections, but mainly when we have another general election in four years' time, it will be shown to be a bankrupt Government – one that had opportunity, that could have brought about real social change, but chose instead to sit tight, to make decisions on behalf of those who most supported it and to make it difficult for those who will follow it to try to bring about a better and more equal society.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly:</from>
          <p eId="para_1048">There is no new way of expressing what has already been said about the performance of the Government. It would be an understatement to say there has been an unprecedented level of dissatisfaction with the Government. It was far from frank about the economic circumstances facing the country in the run up to the general election. The dissatisfaction was largely evident in four different areas: health, education, housing and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">We were promised world-class hospitals. Now we have people being treated on trolleys. It is common to read about patients waiting for up to five days on trolleys, some of them dying there – not a very dignified way to exit this life. Accident and emergency patients are being treated in body storage areas. Things are getting worse – this morning I heard about patients being treated in car parks. Monaghan General Hospital has been off call for more than 12 months. Somebody injured outside the gates of the hospital must spend up to two hours in an ambulance being brought to another hospital. This is completely ignoring the principle of the golden hour. When somebody is put into an ambulance after having a heart attack, every minute counts. Lives are being lost. At Cavan General Hospital the training status of junior doctors was recently discontinued. Within my own constituency, two hospitals are in major crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">We were promised 3,000 extra hospital beds. Now we see hundreds of hospital beds closing down in the eastern region. Some of these hospitals, we are told, are the future regional centres of excellence. They are telling us that they will only treat people from the eastern region. They do not want to treat people from rural areas, despite the fact that they have been funded to treat people from these areas. Our own maternity unit in Monaghan closed some time ago; now there is the threat of more closures of maternity hospitals nationally. This is in spite of the fact that services are needed locally and an obstetrician is not always required. Accident and emergency units are also under threat. Some 22 hospitals nationally are under threat of closure because training facilities in the Royal College of Surgeons are deemed more important. This is more important that saving the lives of people in local general hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The charges in accident and emergency units have increased to €40 and VHI charges have increased by 20%. Overnight hospital charges have increased and the drugs refund threshold has increased to €70 per month. Hospital waiting lists are at an all time high. The only effort which is being made is the treatment purchase fund, which is wrong. Surgeons and consultants are more than willing to work in places such as Monaghan. Patients with varicose veins are being sent to other areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">They can find an insurance company. I would like to see that in writing. They have no difficulty in this regard. They can do the work if they are allowed. They worked effectively with Craigavon to perform hernia operations under the cross-Border programme. That would give Monaghan viability. We must look at these areas before purchasing services from outside the country which often cost 40% to 60% more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Work regarding children's dental treatment has  been deferred for weeks. The Minister spoke earlier about an increase in numbers in the health service. There has been an increase in numbers in the health service but the fact is that we are bloated with senior executives. They are tripping over each other, going to meetings and not making decisions. This aspect must be addressed. It has been suggested that taking political representatives off health boards will make a difference. I believe that will not make a substantial difference to the health service because the core issues must first be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Obviously the Department of Health and Children realises that it is in deep trouble. It recently employed Brian Dobson and pointed out 100 faults that should be addressed and the answers that should be given. It wants the chief executives to become spin-doctors and not be caught in a position where they cannot give answers. When in deep trouble the policy is to do some spinning, give out some good news and let people know about patient satisfaction surveys.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">Before I speak on the motion, I want to give an example of a group of people in my area who are very deprived. These are the driftnet fishermen in the Achill area. They are trying to eke out a living but they are being squeezed out slowly. In 1997, the salmon task force report reduced their fishing area from 12 miles out to six miles. Their season was reduced from 28 March-25 July to 1 June-31 July. Their day was reduced from 24 hours to 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday and 4 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with no fishing on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This group of people are being squeezed out and I hope the Government will do something about it. It would take very little to sort out these fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">We heard the other day about the partial collapse of a school roof. It was a terrible sight and gave me a shiver down my spine. I recently raised an issue in the Dáil about a school in my village which is falling down. It is being held together by some type of wire mesh and it is the grace of God that it is not falling down. This is due to Government neglect. The school is in need of repair but funding is not being made available to carry out the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Prior to the election extra medical cards were promised. If the cost of extending the scheme to the over 70s had not been so great, 250,000 people could have been taken in. This would make great sense because people would be kept within the primary care system. This would be cost-effective and very efficient, instead of pushing them into the acute hospital services at a major cost. If one has two machines, it would make much more sense to use the machine that runs at a much lower cost than using the machine that costs a lot to run. This scheme was a big mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Hospital beds have been cut back by 534 so far this year. The real problem in the health service is lack of capacity and funds. Money has been  invested in recent years which equates to other countries in Europe but prior to that services were totally run down. We keep hearing that health boards must make cutbacks because there is not sufficient money to run the service, which is the problem. The other day the Minister for Health and Children said that he will cut capital funding for the next four years. How will matters improve if capital funding is cut back? How will things improve if sufficient money is not made available to run the service? What is this doing for the 100,000 people who are not even on the waiting list? When the waiting list was being calculated these people were not taken into account. As a general practitioner, I know of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">People in my area are waiting four years for a rheumatology appointment. A man who appeared on "The Late Late Show" showed his hands which were totally bent. This happened because he was left for years waiting for an appointment he should have got within weeks. That is criminal. I am pleased he appeared on "The Late Late Show", otherwise people might not know this is happening. I talk about these people whom I come across in my practice. We have fewer consultants than Croatia. People must wait four years for a service they should get within four weeks, which is unforgivable. This man bore witness to the gross neglect which is taking place. Some 1,000 people in my area are waiting five years for an operation that would take 20 minutes just because there is no urologist in the area. A urologist comes from Galway but he cannot cope with the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">People's lives are destroyed. They must get up five times a night for five years because they cannot have an operation that would take just 20 minutes, which is unforgivable. All the time money is being invested in a private health system to support the building of private hospitals through tax schemes and the treatment purchase fund. We are supporting hospitals at home and abroad at a greater cost. This money should be invested in local services to provide a rheumatologist and urologist. There is a saying, "If you give a man a fish you will feed him for a day, if you teach him to fish you will feed him for life".</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The bottom line is that we have a topsy-turvy health service. We have an apartheid health service, which is very clear in the cancer area. The failure of the Minister to publish the radiotherapy report means the real debate cannot continue. It is costing three times as much to bring people to Dublin for a service they are not getting in their own area and, as a result, they are dying. This is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1065">There are many areas on which I could concentrate in this debate. Two weeks ago the Labour Party issued a 40-page document entitled Broken Words, Broken Promises, which itemised more than 100 cutbacks and broken promises. I could speak about each of them. In the few minutes I have I want to focus on one of the most appalling and miserly cuts the Government has foisted on the most vulnerable group in society. I speak of those people who rely on home help. Is the Government aware of the dire circumstances of home help provision in the Southern Health Board area?</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">In my constituency of Kerry South, many people who have contacted me are in a most awful state. Home help is essential to assist families who are caring for the elderly or the ill. Many families who are trying to keep their lives together while keeping a parent or sibling at home need home help. Since the general election the home help hours which were sanctioned for sick or housebound people are not now being sanctioned by the health board. For example, the public health nurse might recommend that a particular person would need home help for four hours per day. However, the health board will say that because of the cutbacks it can only provide two hours. They have it down to such a fine art in the Southern Health Board area that if a person applies for help to get an elderly person up and washed in the morning he or she will be provided with help for half an hour. If one wants help to light a fire, one will be allowed ten minutes. It is a desperate reflection on our society to treat elderly and ill people like this, and it is a worse reflection on the Government. I was recently contacted by a family whose mother is in the final stages of senile dementia. She has a very small family and the members have juggled their lives to keep their mother at home where they want her. She had 21 hours home help service per week and members of the family were recently told that three hours was to be cut. While this might seem small to some people, those three hours meant further juggling. Time had to be taken off work and grandchildren had to be looked after by an elderly grandparent. This is just one example of the cuts that have gone unnoticed by the media and in the corridors of power. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said that money does not sort out all the problems. However, a very small amount of money would sort out this problem and the Government should provide it. I pay tribute to the staff in the health boards who are at the coalface of telling people they cannot get home help.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">At least the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, came clean in the House last night about the letter he sent to Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn before the last general election. I call on all the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Members to put on the record of the House all the letters of comfort they issued before the general election and we can then decide who made promises and who broke them.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">This is an important debate. It is worth remembering that the present combination of parties has now been in power for six years and has presided over the greatest prosperity this country has ever known. Great things could have been done, particularly in our health service, but they just did not happen. We could now have a high quality, easily accessible health service that would be the envy of other countries. While money went in, the improvements that could have emerged did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The deep inequality that exists between private and public patients continues. The hospital waiting lists have barely been dented. It is a scandal that not one low-income family has received an additional medical card as happened in the past when income limits were raised. A single person who goes over €138 per week is unable to get a medical card. However, the Taoiseach can state in the House that doctors' fees have increased in some cases to €30 or €40 per visit. It is a tragedy that the Government mishandled the health service so badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Prior to the last general election, it was clear that people were concerned about the health service and so the Minister for Health and Children turned magician and conjured up a health strategy that dazzled the public and convinced people the position would improve. He did not tell the people that three weeks before that health strategy was published, the Minister for Finance had informed him that there was no money to back it up. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, also informed the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. However, all four of them went out in collusion and sold a pup to the people. As soon as the general election was out of the way the avalanche of cutbacks and increased charges came down on the heads of the unfortunate people who were trying to access health care. Among so many, the voices of a small group of women who underwent symphysiotomy operations were hardly heard. This morning the Taoiseach yet again told those women to get back in the queue and wait in line, as they would not get the redress they seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">There are others whose voices are not being heard, those of the children who are trying to access care in the national tertiary hospital at Crumlin that treats very sick children. That hospital now finds that as a direct result of a ministerial directive from the Department of Health and Children it has to cut back and close 25 hospital beds. These beds could be accessible to children who are very sick, but are not. The closure of those beds has a ripple effect right through that hospital. Those caring for the children are desperately worried about what is happening in the hospital. However, the Minister simply says it should not be happening. He abandons all responsibility on his part and that of his Department and simply blames the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">I wish to lay down a marker. Today, we had yet another press conference by the Government. The spin went out saying this is a reforming Government that will put everything to right. Not  one additional cent has been allocated to make the transitional or permanent arrangements for structural reform announced by the Minister today. Not one element of local accountability will be retained in the structures that are proposed. Even Professor Niamh Brennan who produced the report did not argue for the ending of health boards and the ending of local accountability. However, unless there is a change of heart, local communities will lose out because the hospital and the community services that depend on them will become more remote and less accessible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1073">I am very impressed by the seriousness with which the Government has taken this Private Members' motion. In my entire time in the House, I do not recall six members of Cabinet addressing a Private Members' motion. I was impressed that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance all contributed last night, although I was less impressed by what they had to say. They contributed because they know the Labour Party has touched a nerve. While they can argue all they like, in truth the argument is lost. The public have decided and the issue is known. The Government was elected on false pretences. The Government parties laid out a manifesto, on which they had no intention of delivering. They bought their way back into Government and the people know it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">It was an interesting threesome, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. Each had a different strategy.

I remember how hard it was to get money for health, when I was Minister for Health because at the time the man charged with minding the money and giving it out was no less a person than the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. I was proud of the achievements of the Labour Party at that time as was Deputy Bertie Ahern and his comments in praise of the actions of Labour in Government are on the public record. I was proud of the record of the Labour Party on every other issue including housing where we reversed the disastrous non-building policies in public housing of the previous Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">The rainbow coalition handed on an economy in pristine condition to the incoming Administration six years ago. Never before has a Government inherited such a fine economy with a current budget surplus and 1,000 new jobs being created every week. For the first time in history, an incoming Government made a sow's ear of a silk purse economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The Tánaiste's tack was somewhat different. She said the Progressive Democrats made no promises and Ireland is surely turning nicely into PD nirvana, with low taxes and privatised services available to those who can pay. The Minister for Finance, totally in character, introduced into this  House a new concept. Pol Pot-like, he introduced the concept of year zero – a new reality. It was different from the old reality in that before the general election there was plenty of money and immediately after the election, in the new reality, there was no money for anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Two other Ministers contributed tonight. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism – having dropped "culture"– who overspent in his general election campaign by €28,000 and made a nonsense of the electoral Acts, reduced a serious debate on the economy to vulgar vaudeville. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is obviously a man with ambitions because he has abandoned his old vaudeville routine and tonight was a very serious contributor. He gave us a psychological analysis of the vote of the people last year. He spoke of the lack of synergy between the parties on this side of the House. He made no mention of the PD campaign, whose main plank was that his party, Fianna Fáil, was unfit to govern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The man who championed that is the next speaker in this debate. He was rewarded by his pole-climbing campaign that characterised Fianna Fáil as unfit to govern alone by being brought into Government to mind them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">The one serious contribution made from the Government benches was the analysis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of our tax regime. His basic thesis was that since we are getting in more money from our taxes, that is fine. Absent from his analysis was any concept of fairness. This Government is bankrupt of ideas and of moral authority. By the judgment of the people, already given, its days in office are numbered, in that as soon as the people are given the opportunity, the Government will be booted out.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sherlock:</from>
          <p eId="para_1080">In 1982 I stood on the plinth of Leinster House. The present Taoiseach came before me and said: "Before you came up here, I could earn £10,000 a year more." That was because there was such a Fianna Fáil majority in this House from 1977 to 1981 and 1982. I formed the opinion that I at least was there to represent the people, as is the Labour Party, while the Taoiseach and his contingent are a bit out of touch with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">That was exactly what the Taoiseach said. Listening to the diatribe from the Government side, from the Taoiseach, Deputy Harney and the Minister for Finance, it is clear they are no different now. They have a majority of people to troop into the lobbies and vote with them. These are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The Taoiseach when speaking referred only to the national roads. He did not refer to the county roads system. In my own County Cork, there has been a reduction of €3.7 million in funding for the county roads. In the north Cork division, it amounts to a reduction of about 17%. Day after day, people are writing to their insurance companies or to Cork County Council claiming for damage to their cars. That is not an exaggeration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">The Government did not properly estimate the cost of giving medical cards to wealthy people. A week ago, a woman told me she was visiting a pharmacy when a large farmer entered, a man for whom she had once worked. He produced a medical card. This lady did not have a medical card. She could not pay medical bills for her dependent children. At the last meeting of the Southern Health Board, the dental representative said that before long in the southern region, in the Cork area in particular, there would be no dental services because the funds had dried up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The elderly and those with disabilities have to be recommended for grants by medical people, by their own GPs in the first instance, and also by the county council medical representatives. Those grants are now abolished. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, should go to Listowel and listen to the people who last night spoke on television about there being no provision for their children who were now graduating, to go into any other schools. They were critical of the fact that nothing was being done in that regard by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I have been working hard at local level with the health board, and at ministerial level, and I am quite sure that elderly people, of whom we have many – which is a great thing – must be defended. If they have not got beds in community hospitals, they are directed to private nursing homes. I know that the Minister for Finance has written to the Minister for Health and Children. I know that they want to change the relevant Act so that this State will not pay a subvention to those people in private nursing homes. I assure the Ministers they will not get away with that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_1153">I thank everybody who contributed to this Labour Party motion, which quite rightly calls the Government to account at the end of its first year in office. I never expected to have to say this, but the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has reduced himself to the same level of buffoonery as that of his predecessor, and that is a low level. Deputy Cuffe may have been unwise in exposing himself to the charge of being hypocritical about his portfolio.  When one is in a glass house, as is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cuffe is not a particularly good target. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who passed the legal spending limit by €28,000 to get himself re-elected to this House, purports to lecture a decent Member, such as Deputy Cuffe, whose foolishness is certainly not on a par with that of some of the colleagues with whom the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, shares the Government benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The only serious speech from the Government side that I heard in the course of this debate was from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. He took an interesting approach to the debate by ignoring the motion, which matches the promises both Government parties made to get power against their performance since the election. The motion does not purport to be about anything else, but the Minister, Deputy Cowen, wants to shift it to an economic debate. He says that we should have such a debate, and I agree with him, let us have it, but that was not the subject of the motion. The Minister does not think the two parties were returned to Government because of the promises they made but because people had more money in their pockets at election time. I think there is some truth in that and it could scarcely be otherwise. The net point, however, is that the Minister sought to posit the artificial reality of a low-tax Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats economy versus the alleged failures of the Labour Party and Fine Gael in the 1980s. That debate is history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">In June 1997 the Minister, Deputy Cowen, inherited an economy on the up and up from the same parties he now derides, Labour and Fine Gael, when my colleague, Deputy Quinn, was Minister for Finance. One thousand jobs per week – 55,000 jobs a year to be precise – were being created at that time, against current weekly job losses of 500. Inflation was the lowest we have had since that time and growth was heading for a record level of 9%. That was the type of economy the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party handed over to these two parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The most disappointing aspect of this debate was that the Tánaiste sought to present to the House the achievements of the past five years as if the economic growth was an achievement of the two parties in government. I would not claim it was the result of the two parties in government which preceded this Government, although it inherited an economy on the cusp of a boom from Deputy Quinn. Everyone in the House knows that the reason for the economic growth of the past seven or eight years is the policies of 25 years standing, such as investment in education and the peculiar convergence of factors at this time. The proposition that it is because of some policies followed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats since coming to power is manifest nonsense. The real question is about the manner in which that boom was wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, sought not only to set up this false juxta position of what happened in the 1980s, but to suggest that we would undermine the basis of industrial strategy. He conveniently allied capital gains tax and corporation profit tax into the one rubric and he pointed out how much it had increased in recent years. It was Deputy John Bruton, Deputy Quinn and myself who negotiated the 12.5% corporation profit tax regime. We have made it clear since then that that is fixed on the industrial landscape.</p>

          <p eId="para_1165">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, tried to suggest that we would do something different on corporation profit tax and on social partnership. We were committed to social partnership. I was implementing social partnership when he was wasting on the backbenches during the days of the great man in Kinsealy. This notion that we would pull the rug from under the economic success we have had is complete and abhorrent nonsense. When he talks about the tax code, he conveniently forgets that it is a carefully calibrated instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">The Minister should look at the Combat Poverty Agency figure. Its analysis shows that the Minister for Finance conferred six times as much resources on the top 30% as he did on the bottom 30% during his first five budgets. There is no arguing with that. If he wants to shift the debate to a discussion about the economy, we can have that debate in the future. However, that is not what this debate is about. He is trying to set up a number of straw men to knock them down, but that is not what the debate is about. He put himself firmly into the Minister for Finance's line of economics. He is merely one step away from denying the existence of society. Let us create more wealth and lower personal taxes, and the trickle down effect will deal with social exclusion. That is the position of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I accept it is a serious position as distinct from the type of speeches made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his immediate predecessor. However, it was not part of the debate tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">The debate tonight was about promises which brought the Government to office, such as the promise to provide 200,000 additional medical cards, of which not one has been offered, the promise to provide 2,000 additional gardaí, of which not one has been provided, and the promise to transfer €2 billion of resources to areas of disadvantage under the RAPID programme. However, the Government pulled the rug from under the RAPID programme as soon as it got back into office. It has also imposed a raft of charges on the people. The Government accused me of a wealth tax on property when the Minister came in today and imposed between €700 and €1,000 on the home of every family in this State.</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">"(<i>a</i>) to take steps to ensure that an equitable balance is maintained between the rights of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who are members of the Government parties and those who are in opposition,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">These are two extremely important amendments because they cut to the heart of the purposes of the Bill, as agreed by Members and committees of this House over a number of years. This commission, when it is established, will allow the Houses of the Oireachtas to govern itself, as is proper. It is important, therefore, that an equitable balance be struck between members of Government parties and those in Opposition. I am concerned that the way the Bill is structured will give an excessive level of power to the Government of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">When this issue was discussed over the years it was agreed, as with other houses of parliament, that membership of this very important committee would consist of senior members from the parties in the House and that these people would work together for the good of all Members of the House and of parliamentary democracy. The way in which the Bill is structured excessively favours the current Government. The commission will comprise the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, a nominee of the Minister for Finance and a member of the Government party. There will be a clear majority in favour of the Government parties. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11, which mention the necessity to maintain an equitable balance in the context of the Bill, are appropriate. Amendment No. 11 would require the commission to consult broadly with "Members of the Houses who are members of Government parties and those who are in opposition" as to the performance of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">The structure of this House has changed in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the last general election. As a consequence, we now have a considerable number of parties in the House, some of which are relatively small, three of which are larger and one of which is very large. We also have a number of Independents. Many of the smaller parties and Independents have gro uped together in the Technical Group in order to secure representation, speaking rights and so on. Given that the diversity with which the electorate chooses to fill the Houses of the Oireachtas has been manifest for some time, it is important that the Bill should make a positive statement about equity, the balance of interest of all the parties in the House and consultation. I have every confidence that the eminent Members who will be appointed to this commission will seek to do that, but it would be far better if it were written into the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Today, when the Estimates for the Office of the Taoiseach are examined by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, we are particularly aware that the resources available to the offices of the Taoiseach and other Ministers are substantial. The Taoiseach was able to tell us today, for example, about the extent of the media monitoring unit and the numbers of people on the staff of the Taoiseach's office who are simply dealing with requests for information from the Sunday newspapers. Opposition spokespeople are in the category of one man and a dog when it comes to resources, back-up and research information. The average Minister and Minister of State has 4.5 people working on constituency matters and has access to a very large back-up of civil servants and very high calibre civil servants working as private secretaries and in the private office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">The Opposition is elected to hold the Government, whatever its composition, properly to account. That is our job and it is important for democracy that we do it. If this commission is to work properly, it is of the gravest importance that an equitable bond be struck and the principle of consultation mentioned and written into the Bill. On that basis, I commend both of these amendments to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. McGrath:</from>
          <p eId="para_1191">I support the amendments put forward by my colleague, Deputy Burton. She has outlined a strong case for the acceptance of those amendments, and for their inclusion in the Bill as it goes through this House. When the commission is established, which we hope will happen fairly soon, it will take on the onerous task of running  these Houses in an equitable way and ensuring that we get best value for taxpayers' money. Part of getting best value for taxpayers' money is ensuring that the Opposition is properly resourced so that it can examine, scrutinise, ask and check, find out how taxpayers' money is being spent and what is happening behind closed doors, and ensuring that it has the backup to be able to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Take a point that arose today, for instance, with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is in the House. The Estimates for the Office of Public Works went through the Houses today, through the select committee, with the Minister of State present. When one considers what happened today, sometimes it is understandable that we look at ourselves and ask, "Are we for real?" First, we are discussing those Estimates for 2003 in June of the same year. I suppose half of the money is spent or, perhaps, the Minister has half of it left – depending on which way one looks at it. Half the money is spent at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">At such committee meetings, there is the Opposition spokesperson, my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who is expected to question the Minister of State on the Estimate. What back-up service has Deputy Bruton, or Deputy Ring, the Front Bench spokesperson on social welfare, which is an important area spending millions of euro? They have one secretary to help them out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">We know the position of Ministers and Ministers of State. They have a team of excellent civil servants who can see what is coming around the corner, anticipate the kind of queries and questions which will arise, anticipate probably what fellows like me will say, and prepare briefing notes for the Minister of State with all the background information which will be available from those people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1196">Unfortunately in our position, it is, as Deputy Burton said, one man and his dog, although I would not like my secretary to think I described her as a dog – it is one man with whatever help he can get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">What is happening, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle? You are longer in this House than anybody else, and you have been there and done that and you know the situation. What happens is that we, as Members of this House, are relying on friends to give us a hand-out with our brief. One gives friends a document and asks that they have a look at it to highlight what is important in it, and what they can do with it, and now and again we bring together groups to look at issues which arise and how we should address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">Does the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, think that is fair? In his previous incarnation in the farming organisation he also had a plethora  of back-up people, but I heard him say, I think at the famous meeting in Athlone, that the Minister can trot out the facts and figures because he has all the civil servants behind him, and he is able to produce all this stuff and swamp the farmers and the press with information. Now that Deputy Parlon is in that position, he is a Minister of State, what will he do?</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The amendments before the Minister of State are simply putting into the Bill the onus on the commission to ask the following questions. How can we equalise the situation? How can we make it fairer? How can we give the Opposition a few teeth, trying to get it on a par? It will never be on a par as regards what is happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">It is interesting that we are all suffering from the repercussions of a recent court case about elections, the publication of spending limits, etc. Some of us got caught, unknown to ourselves. The court decided that in elections one must try to achieve equality. The court made that decision and I respect it. However, how one can implement equality in the case of elections is somewhat impossible to say. If there is a Minister in a constituency and one is standing for election for the first time, the Minister remains in office for the duration of the election and can use whatever secretarial services he has as backup. They might take into account a notional cost for some of it but if, for instance, a Minister comes to a constituency to open a school, or perhaps a Garda station, which might be more appropriate, how much of it can one call electioneering and put down as costs associated with electioneering, and how much of it can one put down to the Minister doing his or her job? One cannot judge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">What about a Senator standing for election to the Dáil who remains a Senator for the duration of the election? What about his or her work? A Senator is entitled to use Oireachtas envelops, etc., and he or she does not have to include it as expenses. How does one balance that? The courts have said that one is supposed to have a level playing pitch which is an awful task to repose to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">Taking that forward, I wonder what would happen if the courts were to look at the case of today's committee. When the committee approved Estimates running to millions of euro, would the court question how one could have equality, in terms of the level of information and backup available to the Minister of State and the level of facilities available to others? Unfortunately that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">On these amendments, I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon – noting what he did, how he behaved and how he worked in his previous incarnation, and the difficulties for the minnow as against the whale – will agree to include this notional concept in the Bill so that at least the commission will be charged with the responsibility of looking to level the playing field.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_742">
          <from>Mr. Ring:</from>
          <p eId="para_1204">The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has been lucky in politics. He never had the problem I encountered. I came into the House from a by-election in 1994 and I was lucky to win it against the odds. From 1995 to 1997, when Fine Gael was in Government, there were two Ministers in my constituency. I had to drive myself around the country and I was expected to be at every public meeting, while these guys had the resources of the State. They had programme managers, press managers and every kind of manager.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">As a Front Bench spokesperson, I am now speaking on behalf of the backbenchers. Deputy Paul McGrath is correct, and Deputy Burton knows what we mean. Yesterday I took on the social welfare Estimates. I got them at 2 p.m. and was expected to go in and question a Minister. I was expected to have all the questions and at the same time have all the answers. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, brought five or six civil servants to the committee. She had another five or six in the Gallery, and I suppose 20 more above in the offices in case there were any mistakes. One sees these officials running in with answers if there are any problems if we have asked a question that the boys and the ladies have not thought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">Like Deputy Paul McGrath, I must compliment these civil servants, in all fairness to them. I have never been a Minister, but I see the books and the reams of information given to Ministers, with the questions that may be asked, could be asked and should be asked, and they have them all. I must compliment them. They leave no stone unturned. If they are caught out, however, as quick as anything one will see the usher coming in with the answer in two seconds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">On the issue of resources and the commission, I want to make a point on behalf of the Front Bench spokesmen. This is about equality. While the Deputies present may not agree with me, I do not want to see the resources being given to the political parties because they are far worse than the Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">The political parties are like the Ministers. When Deputies, who were once Ministers, are in Opposition they want everything, and the minute they go over to the other side of the House they forget about us. The political parties will just gobble up the resources, and we will have more staff within the offices and nobody to do the work we need to do. If resources are to be given out, they must be given out equally. I was on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and I sat beside my British counterparts. They were accompanied by people with briefcases and pages of material relating to the agenda, questions to be asked and questions not to be asked. One day I said to a colleague: "You have done a great lot of work on this" and he replied: "Deputy, I have not researched this, I have three or four people and  this is their job, they come along and they do all the research, all I have to do is read the briefing document and I know what to do."</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Deputy McGrath, Deputy Burton and myself have one secretary. My secretary has to answer the telephone, do the typing and collect the information for me. I come down to the Chamber and most times I do not have a speech typed out because I cannot ask my secretary to do so. I must do it myself because I do not have the resources. Modern parliaments require modern support services. The day is gone when TDs travelled up on the train from their constituencies on a Monday or Tuesday and they returned on the train on Friday. There was no local radio and there was no contact with them. Dublin was so far away it did not matter. They might be found on a Saturday or Sunday but they were gone again on a Monday. We are now in instant contact thanks to mobile phones and the Internet. We can be located immediately. I receive queries from the media from all over the world. An Irish person rang me from Scotland recently to ask for my help in obtaining a visa for America. A person from South Africa—</p>

          <p eId="para_1215">When the Minister of State goes to the doorstep somebody will say to him: "I wrote to you three years ago and I did not even get a reply". That is the sort of pressure he will be under and he may not even remember the letter. The Minister of State is lucky because he is an officeholder and has the resources of State to call upon. I remember running around the constituency of Mayo, and the constituents expect me to have the same back-up and support as my two colleagues. Even with all the resources of State at their disposal, I was lucky enough in 1997 to be ahead of them. That trump card is now being taken away from me – I was on that occasion a member of the local authority and I was in touch with issues on the ground. I listened to the people and I was able to do the work on the ground.  That trump card is being taken away by the Government, but that is an issue for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">My two constituency colleagues had the benefit of programme managers and civil servants who came down at the weekends to do the constituency work. I was a great man to be able to beat them. It is not fair to backbenchers and to the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil. I believe that Ministers should have the resources. They need the back-up and they should have State cars, but I do not think Ministers should take away resources from backbenchers and take away from us the only thing that keeps us going, contact with the people. They are making a mistake in relation to the county councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">We fell into the same trap today in relation to the proposals for health. The media stated that the elected representatives were the reason for the chaos in the health services. I guarantee that in ten years' time the health service will be no better than it is now and the people running it will be blamed like the politicians. The politicians are elected by the people and at least we are accountable to the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1219">We go before the interview board every five years. When a consultant doctor or some former civil servant is appointed to the new commission, they are not answerable to anybody and the powers of this House are being eroded. It is becoming more meaningless. Last Friday, the Dáil adjourned because there was not a quorum. County councils should legislate. I have been on the county council for over 25 years and I never saw the business of the county council collapse. People were always in attendance because they were interested. This House must be treated with respect. If we do not treat it with respect, how can we expect the public to do so? We are running it on a day to day basis because the media determine what we discuss. That is not the fault of the media but rather our fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">On today's report in relation to health, the first people to see it were the media, who had it three weeks ago, but this House did not get it until today. That is not democracy, it is dictatorship. It is a dangerous road to take because the ball often hops the wrong way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1221">I support the taking together of Deputy Burton's amendments Nos. 10 and 11. If amendment No. 10 is passed, amendment No. 11 will have to be changed. I hope that will be the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">No moment over the recent past exemplified the reality of the Opposition Member as against the Government spokesperson, that is, Ministers and Ministers of State, more than the pre-Private Members' Business episode this evening. The Minister of State must acknowledge that for a very short time, though he never experienced it,  he had the opportunity to taste the reality of the Opposition Deputy when he was all at sea. He did not have his back-up and support. Colm agus na cailíní had not arrived in time to save the day and the business of the House had to be suspended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">The business of the House would not be suspended if any of the Opposition Deputies had not the back-up and the resources. We do not have them. We must formulate our contributions based on whatever time, energy and gifts we have been blessed with in terms of going through rafts of legislation. Some of us have multiple portfolio responsibilities and it is a very difficult task. I have no doubt that from that little experience this evening the Minister of State will accept the validity of the arguments of Opposition Deputies when we seek equality in this House, when we seek the back-up resources that would allow us the time to properly prepare. It does not serve the wider electorate well that the Government and Government spokespersons can proceed through craft, and perhaps craft alone on some occasions. There is an onus for the balance of scrutiny and the responsibility that comes with that position in ensuring that legislation is geared and designed to serve the interests of the community in a fair and equitable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Back-up research support is absolutely critical. I believe that these amendments will facilitate an important change in the arrangements for the future of Parliament as we are and I hope we will be in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">Other inequities also need to be addressed. I have highlighted the inequity of office accommodation many times. The party that I lead and represent in this House has the lowest square metre <i>per capita</i> of any of the political parties in this House. We had to fight to even get what we have. A year after the general election one of my colleagues is still sharing a single telephone line with his PA. A second line has still not been installed. Missive after missive, begging after begging, that is the reality we must face. It is no small wonder sometimes that we can be very edged in our comments at Whips' meetings in regard to opportunities in this House. These are things we should not have to agitate about. We should not have to repeatedly raise and refer to these matters. They are distractions from our work. The system in this House is failing the elected voices of the people by not providing the essential resources for people to carry out their work and the function that has been entrusted to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">I also want to refer to printing facilities, one of a range of areas in which equity is absent. Sinn Féin has no access to printing facilities, a matter that is being discussed continually but about which no conclusion has been reached. I had no access to printing facilities during the five years I spent in this House as the sole representative of my party. Others are enjoying the use of such  facilities on a continuous basis. The failure to provide printing machinery and people to operate it is an outrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">Similarly, there are difficulties regarding access to Ministers, who are representatives of the Government and not of their parties. We often lecture the First Minister in the North of Ireland, David Trimble, by pointing out that he is not the First Minister of the Unionist community who elected him, but the First Minister of all the people in the North of Ireland. He has failed to perform that function, but the Minister of State's colleagues are also failing to perform their functions. Opposition Deputies do not have the same access to Ministers as their colleagues on the Government benches. Information is continually released to party colleagues from different constituencies in advance of specific announcements. Government backbenchers can have an advantage of at least 24 and sometimes 48 hours over Opposition Deputies who will not have received a signal to indicate that a train was coming down the tracks. Such release of information is not what Ministers are appointed to do. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has demonstrated, one's role as a Minister should be distinct from one's role as a Deputy for one's constituency. Ministers should operate a fair and equitable system of access and release of information to ensure there is a level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">The release of the health reports today was a good example of this problem. I am Sinn Féin's spokesman on health and children, as well as finance, and I am also a member of a health board. The chief executive officers of the health boards were given a full briefing on the reports yesterday evening. The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party was briefed on the reports this morning at 9.30 a.m. and I presume a similar provision was made for the Progressive Democrats, by whatever means.</p>

          <p eId="para_1233">I had to leave today's meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service many times to check if the reports had been made available. I had to absent myself from the meeting briefly to fine-tune my reaction to the release of the documents.  Members may think it is sharp practice and shrewd politics to put Opposition spokespersons on a particular portfolio on the back of their heels. Perhaps the Government thinks that giving spokespersons inadequate time and notice and a lack of full information will make them less effective, but it damns the Government and not the Opposition. The political interests I aspire to develop in this House are not damaged, but a great disservice is being done to those who are not being served – those who elected me and the wider electorate. The quality of the work of the Opposition and the Government in this House is diminished and we are all affected as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">I will conclude by saying that I could give many more examples of problems in the running of this House. The issue about which I am speaking does not relate simply to the lack of back-up resources to assist one's preparation for one's contributions on legislation, such as this Bill. Many examples can be given to demonstrate that there is an uneven playing field and to show that the inequities which are almost endemic in this House are being perpetuated by this Government. It is time for people who aspire to fair play and equity across the board to take this issue by the scruff of the neck and to ensure that real and substantive changes are made. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has the first chance to facilitate such change, by accepting amendments Nos. 10 and 11 in the name of Deputy Burton. I await the Minister of State's response. I hope he will show himself to be the man I hope he is, and grab the opportunity to put down a marker for real change, by adopting these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1244">The Deputy has the personal touch. I have the height of respect for the backup I receive from the Civil Service. As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, we were surprised this evening when the discussion of this Bill was brought forward. I would have brought my notes with me if I had known it was going to happen, but we had to seek a suspension as we were not ready. Deputy Burton was also delayed and was unable to move some of her amendments. The personal touch is important. We all know that a politician who depends entirely on advisers or civil servants is doomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I wish to discuss these amendments in serious terms. The Department of Finance has had a clear policy in its dealings with Members or political parties over the years. Ministers and officials have been obliged to operate without favour to any Member or party in its operations, modification of schemes and dealings. Such an approach has been reinforced by legal advice in the last two decades. There are obligations to be impartial when dealing with individual cases or wider schemes. Ministers and officials have been made aware through court judgments of the implications of overlooking such obligations, even inadvertently. The same standards are adhered to by the officials with whom Members deal in this House each day and are upheld by their political heads. I do not envisage that the new commission will be unaware of these obligations. It is certain that its members will be warned about the obligations if they show they are unaware of them.</p>

It is important that the membership of the commission reflects, in particular, the needs of back-bench Deputies – not the needs of Government, but those of backbench Deputies from all parties. All Members are aware that the key requirement of this House is resources regarding staffing. We need improved conditions for the wonderful people who carry out the secretarial duties for Members of the Oireachtas. They do so, particularly if they are recent recruits, at very low rates of pay, which are certainly not particularly competitive rates in respect of the Dublin area.</p>

          <p eId="para_1265">I am disappointed in the Minister of State. The commission is not about politics. Its purpose is to run the business of the House on behalf of its Members. It is a bit like the Ceann Comhairle's job; to run the business and to control the way business is conducted. The commission is set up on the same basis. This is not about Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin or any other party, it is about a commission being set up to run the business of the House and it will have legal responsibilities in that regard. It is not about who has the most members. The Government is sending out the wrong message if it feels it has to have total control of it. Ultimately, the interests of the backbenchers in Fine Gael and the Labour Party are the same as the backbenchers in the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">At the end of the day we will all be speaking the one language. Its aim is to get more resources and better services for Members of the Oireachtas. It is about equality. The fact that the Government wants to have a majority is sending out the wrong message.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">In advance of the passing of the Bill, perhaps the Minister of State and the Minister will look at it again with their officials and come back to us to say that it is not about having control, it is about equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Deputy McGrath has offered a way around this issue. The Government is well enough represented so when the commission members are being selected they should come from the Opposition. It is not about somebody having control because this is supposed to be in the best interests of every Member in this House, not about any political party. If we go down the party political road, the commission is doomed to fail. It is in all our interests that it works and that it is seen to work fairly. It is in all our interests that there is equality in the commission. Perhaps the Minister of State will come back to us and say that we are right and that instead of having a majority for the Government there will be equality across the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1278">It is very much an issue for this House as to who will represent it. I come from a small party and do not know if my party will  ultimately have a say. Personally, I am not overly concerned because, as Deputy Ring said, it is not about politics it is about working together. It will be a small group of ten people. It would be wrong to start dictating as to whom either House should nominate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">In the Seanad, I referred to the extra resources that will be made available to the commission. Over the three-year life span it will be the equivalent of an extra 200 staff. If the commission so chooses, it can direct all of the resources towards extra staff in terms of the backup that backbenchers and the Opposition claim is currently so deficient. That is one possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">It is wrong at this stage to start dictating what the commission should do or how it will be constituted. I have the utmost faith that there will be both balance and equity in the commission, including the two Chairs. It is very much for it to decide how to run its business. It will be a positive progression for the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Finance and the Government will have very little say in how it is run. The Minister for Finance will not have any say at all. He is anxious to divorce himself from this aspect of it.</p>

He suggested that it may be reflective of the mix of parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas. He expressed the view that everyone should work together on the commission. That was what was sought in the various debates on this subject down the years in committees of the House.

          <p eId="para_1284">I am reminded of the biblical phrase, "The first shall be last . . . "  or, perhaps, "Beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach"– our day will also come.

          <p eId="para_1295">This amendment is self-evident. It proposes to include a provision in the Bill to commend to the commission that reports of the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas committees be made available by way of publication and on the Internet. In an Estimates debate today, there was reference to e-government, e-learning and e-initiative. This is our contribution to the Government's initiative in relation to making material available through electronic means.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Many young people access information through the Internet on a continuous, random and casual basis. If this information is made available through the Internet, it will undoubtedly increase awareness of the Dáil, particularly among young people, by making it accessible and, I hope, interesting. My concern is that if it has to go as a positive item to be included in a three or five year plan once the commission is appointed, it may take years of debate, as in the case of the televising of debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">People are familiar with the Internet and, of course, information on Oireachtas proceedings is already in the public domain. We are simply asking that it be made more accessible. The Oireachtas staff already has an excellent system in operation, whereby initial reports of proceedings are available very quickly and final reports are available relatively quickly. This should be provided for in the Bill so that the members of the commission will receive it as a mission from the Dáil, without having to re-invent the wheel, as it were, by reopening the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1298">I support Deputy Burton's  amendment. Perhaps it should not be necessary to include such an amendment in the Bill – I hope the Minister of State, in his response, will copperfasten the fact that this will actually appear by way of a direction which the commission will follow. It is very important to present our material through the new electronic means. In my experience, the staff of the Oireachtas provide an excellent service. People in the general office are absolute wizards at finding material, even in relation to difficult parliamentary questions – the system is excellent. However, we need to have material more accessible to our individual offices, without having to burden the general office with our difficulties. The system should bring the debates and other relevant material on to the Internet in a relatively short period of time. The "blacks" are already accessible throughout the Houses fairly quickly after debates, but we need a further system to make the information more widely accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">I know the response may be that there are difficulties in terms of editing and so on and I agree that is a difficulty. Perhaps it will require more staff – it is a very skilful job. Sometimes, no doubt, it can be very difficult to make sense of some of the ramblings of fellows like me. However, it is important to get Oireachtas material on to the electronic system as early as possible. I hope the Minister of State will endorse both the concept enshrined in this amendment and the move by Oireachtas staff to bring the relevant material on to the Internet. On that basis, even if he does not accept the amendment, at least the commission will know it was the sentiment of this House that progress should continue in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1300">I also support amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Burton. The Minister of State will recall our discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. I believe the request to ensure speedy publication of the business of this House and all its committees is a worthy one, which I hope the Minister of State will be eager and anxious to endorse. The Internet facility is increasingly accessible, allowing people the opportunity to check in speedily on the proceedings of this House, in all its various guises. I believe we should take this route, recognising, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, that there may be a 24 to 48 hour delay in terms of finalising material through the editing process of the "blacks". The arguments in support of this amendment are self-sustaining. Undoubtedly, there is great interest in information access among the wider public and the Internet facility is now being used by an increasing number of people. For this House to absent itself from that forum would be a major mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Other proposed means of publication are not  actually specified. I am not sure as to what other formats would meet the information needs of the wider public, but I would certainly support any reasonable proposal to allow for release of the record of the House, in hard copy format, on request. I believe it should be as speedily available through the Government Publications Office as it is to Members of the Houses. I will conclude on that point. As the time is fast approaching ten bells, perhaps the Minister of State may wish to conclude this debate on the Bill on a positive note by accepting an amendment from an Opposition Member.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon:</from>
          <p eId="para_1302">I am greatly impressed by Deputy Ó Caoláin's brevity. We already discussed the matter at an earlier stage. I understand much of Deputy Burton's request, but it is currently in place. For example, the full texts of the Official Report of parliamentary debates of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are published on the Internet on the same day if the debate finishes before 7 p.m. Otherwise, the material is published on the Oireachtas website by 1 p.m. on the following day. I believe that is recognised by all sides of the House as a very positive and speedy service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Parliamentary debates of the Dáil and Seanad have been published on a next day basis on the Internet since June 1997. The full text of the debates of parliamentary committees, joint and select, are all published on the website. The "blacks" are available by the Monday following a meeting and published shortly thereafter. Priority is given to select committees, the Public Accounts Committee and then joint committees. The entire text of parliamentary debates, since 1919 in the case of the Dáil and 1922 in the case of the Seanad, is also available on the website. The question of extension or improvement of this facility will be a management decision by the new commission, which it is not for me to pre-empt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Deputy Paul McGrath is inclined to dictate what the new commission should do. For the reasons I stated I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Community Employment Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_803">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh:</from>
          <p eId="para_1305">I wish to raise the matter of community employment schemes on the Adjournment. When I submitted this matter, I did not know that Fianna Fáil opposes community scheme cuts, as reported in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> Up to 30 Deputies and Senators spoke passionately about this and they unanimously demanded that existing CE places be maintained. It is strange that on the same day as this article was published, announcements were  made of another six CE schemes being cut in my constituency. These cuts can be added to a considerable number of other schemes that have been cut in the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">At the start of 2002 there were 26 schemes in place in the Dublin 12 area. I will concentrate on what has happened to CE schemes in Dublin 12 because that has been repeated in Dublin 8 and in Dublin 10, which are also in my constituency. This has been repeated in many other disadvantaged communities throughout Dublin and the rest of the country. Of the 26 schemes established in Dublin 12, only 12 remain. How can the remaining schemes provide the services that were provided by 26 schemes? There is not a hope in hell of them doing that. There has been a 31% cut in CE schemes this year. With no recruitment being allowed, by the end of the year some of the existing schemes will no longer be viable. There has been a cut of 50% in the number of participants on CE schemes in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">It is not only CE participants who have been affected by these cuts, six supervisors in the Dublin 12 area have also lost their jobs. It was agreed that they would be entitled to four weeks pay in statutory redundancy, but that has changed. The new statutory redundancy package is eating into the four weeks payment they were promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">We probably all received a letter form the Irish Wheelchair Association and from the Disability Federation of Ireland about the effects of these cutbacks. The Government has decimated the schemes, many of which in recent years allowed people with disabilities to move around and to have access to the services they need. In the case of Irish Wheelchair Association, 417 CE places had been reduced to 194 by December last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">I do not know how Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators can accept the excuse from Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, that the cuts in CE schemes have been minimal. The figures I outlined are in an area where some of the schemes are protected because they are drugs task force related. I do not understand how a 50% cut in respect of these schemes in two years can be described as minimal. The Government is not seriously addressing the effects of the cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">Some people talk about the need to secure value for money. People involved in running a social economy scheme spent €600,000 of taxpayers' money, which will be lost because the Government will not give grant approval for the employment of a manager. That money was spent refurbishing a house, but it will be lost because the Government is not willing to budge. The Government accepts that the social economy project is valuable, viable and should continue, but because of its restrictions, it will not give approval for the employment of a manager and as result the Exchequer will suffer a loss of €600,000. That is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">Despite the partnership process, it is crazy that  the Government continues to cut community employment schemes. They play a vital role in providing services to those who are less well-off, the elderly, those with disabilities and those who are impoverished because of years of Government cutbacks and lack of investment. I urge the Government to reverse the cutbacks it has announced in the CE schemes and instead to invest money in them to make them viable.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_804">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</from>
          <p eId="para_1312">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500, which amounts to a reduction of 5,000 places approximately, phased over the year. The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects, including projects in Dublin and surrounding areas, is a matter for FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity in the delivery of these services. However, such places are subject to the normal eligibility requirement for the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">I understand that difficulties are being encountered by certain organisations that have problems in replacing participants due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. All health service related CE projects have been ring-fenced from reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. During 2002, when CE places were reduced from 38,809 places down to 25,000 places, FÁS ensured that these designated health CE places were untouched and that the places were maintained as agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">CE expenditure in the Dublin area is a matter for FÁS. In relation to that area and the recent reductions there, I understand that FÁS has consulted local community groups before implementing changes that reflect the reduced funding available for community employment. The priorities proposed – the retention of community employment places relating to drugs services, affordable child care, health or disability services and the high priority for projects in RAPID neighbourhoods – are being recognised by FÁS in deciding the optimum use for the funds available. Many participants have completed their time on community employment and are  ready to move on, and a number of others have been offered places on other projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Funding amounting to €274.3 million is being provided for the administration of the CE programme on a national basis during 2003. Decisions on this year's financial allocation for CE were taken in the context of the 2003 Estimates process and the allocation for this year has not been further reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">A key indicator of economic performance is labour market change. Employment in the Irish economy grew last year by 1.4%. The unemployment situation remains stable at just 4.6%. A particularly welcome feature of Ireland's labour market performance over recent years is the low long-term unemployment rate, which has fallen from 10.4% in 1988 to 5.6% in 1997 and now stands at just 1.4%. While indicators show a softening in the labour market conditions there are still substantial employment opportunities available in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">The Government is aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years. In this context a number of reviews of CE are currently under way. The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, which is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes, which will arise in the context of the 2004 Estimates process.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Flood Relief.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_805">
          <from>Mr. Finneran:</from>
          <p eId="para_1320">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works. He will be very much aware of why I raise such a matter as he and I have had long experience of the difficulties experienced by people due to this problem, particularly in the south Roscommon area but also in adjoining counties. The Clonown area of south Roscommon has experienced flash flooding as well as flooding generally as a result of a number of matters of maintenance of the River Shannon that have been neglected. The Shannon is one of the finest waterways in Europe, but over many years people in the area  of the southern section of the Shannon, in the Roscommon constituency, have suffered great hardship, with lands being flooded and stock and houses being marooned. Their lifestyles have been exposed to the elements in a way that has not generally been experienced by people in other regions in this lifetime and this has affected their ability to live comfortably.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">I have put down this motion knowing that the Minister in charge, Deputy Parlon, has a hands-on and intimate knowledge of the problems. Indeed, in another capacity he attended meetings on many occasions to listen to the grievances and problems experienced by people in that area in particular and in adjoining counties. A number of problems need to be dealt with. We still have major flooding problems. There is seldom an opportunity for people to know in advance how they stand in times of heavy rain and they do not seem to have any link to the statutory authorities that control the levels of the Shannon, particularly during the vital lead-up to flood times. Sometimes a Minister turns up or we see television cameras there, but by then the horse has bolted. The information available locally is that if advance measures were taken we might not suffer the dire consequences we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">There is a number of contributing factors to the problems on the Shannon. The most important one is that there is no maintenance of the main channel of the river. I appreciate what this Minister has done in terms of giving an allocation, albeit small, towards a survey to be carried out this year. All I am asking the Minister is that he ensures that those carrying out the survey meet local interest groups, action committees and local authorities in that area to establish the facts and not to rely on the information of people who feel they know what the position is, people who live far from the area. Let us get hands-on, in-depth and local involvement for this survey. That would be very helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">As I said in a committee meeting earlier today, an overall major development of drainage works for the Shannon is not a reality and should not even be considered, either now or in the future. However, a maintenance programme for the Shannon is something to which we should aspire in the short-term and deliver in the mid to long-term. The Minister of State, with his in-depth knowledge of what is involved in this area due to his farming background, which I share, has seen the problems we have tried to deal with over the years. We have had the help of the local authority and sometimes the Army to take people and stock out of flooded areas. I hope the Minister will outline tonight the positive steps the Department is taking, through the Office of Public Works, in the interest of the people about whom I have spoken in the Roscommon area and in Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and east Galway,  who have suffered severe hardship over many years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_806">
          <from>Mr. Parlon:</from>
          <p eId="para_1324">I thank the Deputy for his question. He and I share lots of first-hand experience of the devastation caused by flooding on the Shannon. As the House will be aware, I received a report from the Commissioners of Public Works on the Shannon flooding problem in January of this year – a copy of the report is available in the Dáil Library. The report reviewed all previous studies and reports and commented on the relevance and validity of available technical data and the steps which would be necessary to propose engineering solutions. After consideration of this report I asked the Office of Public Works to carry out a pre-feasibility study into possible flood relief measures on the Shannon. The initial report identified a number of areas which merit further study and the purpose of this preliminary investigation is to establish whether it would be appropriate to proceed with a full feasibility study.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The River Shannon drains approximately one fifth of the country and is characterised by relatively steep upper and lower sections and a very flat gradient in its middle section. The lands surrounding the Shannon, particularly those along its flat middle section, including some of the areas to which the Deputy referred, have experienced regular flooding for centuries. Severe or unseasonal flooding is causing disruption to local residents and significant damage to the agriculture industry. There is no single simple solution to the flooding problems associated with the Shannon and a combination of measures, possibly including modern rainfall forecasting and water management techniques, would be required to reduce flood levels by a significant degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Any new study of the Shannon must be closely couched by the realities of financial, environmental and physical constraints. Conditions have changed considerably since the last comprehensive study of the Shannon, which took place in 1961. The "summer scheme" then proposed was estimated to cost £15 million in 1961. In today's prices that scheme would cost between €500 and €700 million. It is obvious that large-scale drainage works would be uneconomic and almost impossible to implement, given the planning and environmental considerations. It is now generally accepted that a comprehensive drainage or flood relief scheme for the entire catchment is not realistic. The Office of Public Works intends to complete the pre-feasibility report in approximately seven months. By that time I will also have available to me the report of the review group on flooding policy and decisions can then be made on the best way forward, taking all considerations into account.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - School Transport.</heading>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_807">
          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_1327">A school bus has been provided for many years to enable children from Newtownmountkennedy in County Wicklow to travel to schools in Greystones, Bray and Wicklow town. Parents pay to avail of this service and the Department of Education and Science has agreed with Bus Éireann to maintain this service for the next five years to accommodate children currently using it. The majority of children starting secondary school in September have opted to enrol at the new school just built in Kilcoole. However, parents wishing to send their children to the same school as older brothers and sisters or to single-sex schools in Bray or Wicklow are being told that this year's first-year students have to travel to the boundary of the catchment area to catch these buses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">Parents are concerned that their younger children are being put at serious risk by the decision to force children to a point well outside the town if travelling to Bray or to a place called Coyne's Cross in the case of children travelling to Wicklow, while their older brothers and sisters can get on and off the same bus in Newtownmountkennedy main street. The bus passes within minutes of their homes. The children travelling to Wicklow are faced with a problem in that there is no public transport in the morning to get them to Coyne's Cross. Once there the children must stand directly on the N11 as there is no bus stop or lay-by, where they are surrounded by major road works and heavy traffic, rather than waiting safely on the pavement at the bus stop on the main street with their older brothers or sisters to catch the same bus. Parents are asking that since there is room for these children on the buses, and the number of children enrolling in the new school is high, the current transport arrangements should remain in place for all children for as long as the service exists, that is, five more years, to prevent the children being put needlessly at risk. It is a simple request which would cost nothing and set no precedent. What it will do, however, is protect children and ensure their safety in a reasonable and compassionate manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">The Minister can do the right thing regarding this small number of children. I urge that he cut through the red tape and ensure the bus takes the children from where they live rather than from far out of the town where they will not be protected as they should in a system that is designed to serve their needs, yet is singularly failing to do so in this instance.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera):</from>
          <p eId="para_1330">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding school trans port for post-primary pupils on the opening of the new community college in Kilcoole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">By way of general comment, I should explain that one of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty attending regularly. There are 130,000 primary and post-primary pupils using the school transport scheme on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Recognised post-primary pupils who live three miles or more from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live are eligible for transport under the school transport scheme to that centre. Pupils who reside less than three miles from their nearest post-primary centre are ineligible for transport on distance grounds under the terms of the scheme. My Department is not in a position to provide transport for basically ineligible pupils to a school outside their catchment area, contrary to the terms of the school transport scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">While it is the parents' democratic right to opt for a choice of school, that does not mean the State is in a position to incur the additional expense entailed in facilitating that choice. To provide for choice of school would add enormously to the costs of the scheme by duplicating transport services all over the place. In such instances, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended. This is subject to spare accommodation being available on an existing service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred. Pupils availing of this concession are known as catchment boundary pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">The new community college in Kilcoole will open in September 2003. Pupils currently provided with transport to schools in adjacent catchment areas will continue to be facilitated with transport until they have completed second level education. New pupils enrolling in schools outside the Kilcoole catchment area from September 2003 will not be considered eligible for transport services to these schools. Accordingly, my Department will not be in a position to approve the provision of transport from within the Kilcoole catchment area to an adjacent centre as such an encroachment would constitute an infringement of the terms of the post-primary transport scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">My Department has to consider the operation of the school transport scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines, which would have financial and policy implications for the transport service overall. The Deputy will  appreciate that the provision of a new school in Kilcoole is a major capital investment and my Department does not intend to take any action that might jeopardise the future viability of the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to explain the position to the House.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Harbours and Piers.</heading>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_809">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</from>
          <p eId="para_1337">I wish to share my time with my colleague from west Cork, Deputy O'Donovan. I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">We are speaking about one of the greatest pieces of political chicanery ever perpetrated on the people of west Cork in general and, more specifically, on the people in the Bantry Bay area. The parties guilty of that political chicanery are the Fianna Fáil-PD parties in Government. The only way they can absolve their guilt is to provide the funds which were committed for the new pier in Bantry and promised prior to the last election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Prior to the election the need for a new pier in Bantry was obvious. In terms of tonnage we are talking about a throughput in Bantry Bay which makes it the third biggest port in the country. Last year alone, 500,000 tonnes of oil went through the port. In addition, 800,000 tonnes of stone was shipped through the Tarmac Fleming jetty. We are also talking about the largest oil storage facility in the country in Bantry Bay and, of course, the largest whitefish port is in Castletownbere in one corner of the bay. We are talking about one of the biggest bays in the world which needs a proper pier. The need is obvious and there was an agreement on all sides to provide it, including on the part of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">The figure involved is €6.5 million euro. As far back as August 2000, there was agreement on the part of the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, to provide a grant from the Department of £1.5 million, which would translate into €1.9 million. At a later stage there was agreement for a further £500,000 from the same Minister. Then the question of the balance arose and, on Deputy Fahey's suggestion, an application was lodged for a grant under the national development plan. Under the plan one could receive up to 35% of the balance. Again, the question arose, from the point of view of going ahead with the job, as to whether the grant from the NDP would be available. That grant was committed by the last Government. Two days prior to the election a letter was sent to Deputy O'Donovan. I obtained a copy of the letter under the Freedom of Information Act. The letter from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, to Deputy O'Donovan reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">Dear Denis</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">I am writing to inform you that I will approve Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners' application for 35% grant aid for a new pier development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">Coincidentally or otherwise, on the same day his constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, was on local radio, County Sound. The presenter, John Green, asked him were there any further developments in the Bantry area, to which he replied:</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">As a final thing I got word today in the middle of all the various other things that I had got provision under the NDP for essential money for the new inner harbour pier in Bantry, so that will go ahead now in the next couple of weeks so that is a great shot in the arm for Bantry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">This money was fully committed and on that basis the project was to proceed. So far the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners have spent €800,000 on the project. Prior to the election they received a reimbursement of €190,000. What has happened since the election? Nothing. There have been letters, telephone calls, representations, parliamentary questions and nothing has happened. What has happened is that since the election the current Minister who is not here – I want to know why he is not here to answer for his responsibilities because he should be here – has turned and twisted in every way possible to try to wriggle out of the commitments made by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. I am aware that he sent the papers to the Attorney General in an effort to get a legal escape hatch out of the written commitments that had already been given for a grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I am saying now that we must end this sorry saga. I am asking the Government to discharge the commitments made and keep its promises. I will finish in order to give a brief word to my west Cork colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, who must be the most embarrassed Deputy in the Dáil as a result of the political chicanery of his colleague in the Fianna Fáil-PD Government. I demand action and I hope Deputy O'Donovan will support me.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_810">
          <from>Mr. O'Donovan:</from>
          <p eId="para_1347">Despite the political angle Deputy O'Keeffe has taken, I agree to a large extent with many of the facts he has outlined. Unfortunately, Bantry was forgotten when Gulf Oil pulled out in the 1980s and paid $60 million at the time. Subsequently, Philips-Conoco bought out INPC and no money was spent on the Bantry pier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">I acknowledge that on 14 June 2000 the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, came to Bantry and announced, with great fanfare and excitement, a £1.5 million allocation towards the pier. Unfortunately at that stage we did not have foreshore or  planning rights and there was a number of delays, which did not help. We could equate it to the parable of the wise and foolish virgins. Considerable pressure was put on leading up to the last election and commitments were given that the pier would proceed. Bantry Bay is the second finest bay in the world. Being without a modern pier that can facilitate tugboats and other vessels to come alongside at low water is like asking Dublin to do without an airport. I hope the Minister will have good news for us. Where there is life there is hope and I am still not giving up on it. I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for allowing me to make a brief contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350">I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is out of the country on official business. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on his behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are the responsible authority under the Harbours Acts 1946 to 1976 for the management, control and operation of Bantry Harbour. At a meeting with Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners in July 2000, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fahey, pledged Exchequer support of up to €1.65 million towards a new pier development at the port as outlined in the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners proposed development plan 1997. The Minister intimated at that meeting that he would be prepared to provide up to €1.9 million if necessary but in the event that the project exceeded €1.9 million, the harbour commissioners would have to provide the additional funds from their own resources. The commitment from the Minister was to be paid from the Department's Vote and was not a commitment for funding under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">The harbour commissioners subsequently updated their estimate of the cost for the development to €6.54 million and in light of this significant increase in the estimated price, the harbour commissioners applied for funding under the seaports measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">Under the 1946 Harbours Act, harbour commissioners are required to seek the Minister's consent for any financial commitment in relation to infrastructural works. In August 2002 it was belatedly brought to the attention of the Department by Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners that they had entered into a contract in respect of the pier development. The harbour commissioners were subsequently advised that, pending clarification on all financial issues relating to the project, the contractors were not to proceed  with the project or incur any additional expenditure. Legal advice has been sought on various legal issues pertaining to the pier development and a response is awaited from the Attorney General in this regard. Accordingly, at present it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</p>

I intend to set out criteria in or under the legislation, to which the regulator will have regard when procuring services.

          <p eId="para_1369">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 128 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">In October 2002 I commenced provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2002 to introduce the penalty points system for the offence of exceeding the speed limit. The Act provides that where it is not possible to identify the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle that has exceeded the speed limit – this situation arises for instance where the commission of a speeding offence is detected by a camera – a notice is issued by the Garda Síochána to the registered owner of the vehicle concerned. This notice conveys details of the commission of an offence and indicates that no prosecution will be initiated if the driver pays a fixed charge within a 28 or 56 day period and accepts two penalty points on their driving licence record. This notice also conveys to the registered owner that if he or she was not driving or otherwise using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence alleged that they should complete and return within 28 days a document giving information, including the name and address of the person who was driving or otherwise using the vehicle. It is an offence for a registered owner to fail to comply with the requirement to supply such information and furthermore it is an offence if a registered owner gives information, whether or not contained in a document, that is to his or her knowledge false or misleading.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">In that context, it should be particularly noted that the Road Traffic Act 2002 also provides that where the registered owner of the vehicle concerned does not furnish information to the effect that some other person was driving or otherwise using the vehicle, then, in a prosecution of that owner for the alleged offence, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that he or she was driving or otherwise using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. Thus where a registered owner does not pay the fixed charge or does not communicate to the Garda Síochána that anyone else was driving the vehicle at the relevant time, a prosecution will be initiated.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_142">Based on the above, it is clear, as has been confirmed by the Garda Síochána, that the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2002 relating to the enforcement of traffic offences generally establish an adequate basis for the pursuit of a prosecution. The rules of the District Court apply equally to all defendants facing trial for summary offences. All persons convicted of the commission of an offence of exceeding a speed limit will, unless the court imposes a disqualification from driving,  have four penalty points endorsed on their licence record in the national driver file.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1382">Dublin Airport is our largest airport and primary international gateway accounting for 15 million passengers last year or 76% of total air passengers in 2002. Traffic at Dublin Airport is expected to double to 30 million passengers by 2020 and one of the key objectives of our aviation policy is to ensure that our principal gateway airports, including Dublin Airport, are in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of airlines and other aviation companies, consistent with a commercial mandate. In the case of Dublin Airport, this will require further substantial investment in both airside and landside facilities in good time to meet the projected growth in passenger numbers and airline services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">One of the main issues in the programme for Government is the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. The report of the panel of experts, chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, in relation to the independent terminal concept at Dublin Airport concluded that the development of such a terminal is both operationally and technically feasible. The panel also believes that an independent terminal is a viable strategic option for the development of Dublin Airport and would elicit considerable market interest.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_144">The concept which emerged from the panel's work was a terminal designed primarily to provide capacity for short haul UK and European flights based on fast turnaround, point to point operations. The terminal would be developed in phases with the first phase providing capacity of up to 10 million passengers per annum. The panel concluded that an independent terminal would stimulate competition at Dublin Airport through increased capacity, operational efficiency and the quality of terminal services and these would provide powerful incentives for airlines to develop additional air services from the airport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">Regardless of how the next tranche of terminal capacity is provided, the panel also concluded that additional runway capacity would also be required to cater for growth at Dublin Airport. My Department is currently finishing a process of consultation with relevant interested parties and stakeholders in relation to the independent terminal concept and it would be my intention to discuss the matter again with Government in the near future.</summary>

These include improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification to accommodate the greatest possible range of people, issues surrounding urban/ rural needs and the cost of suitable vehicles. These issues will be addressed by the statutory commission for taxi regulation, when established, as part of its general role in relation to the development of new small public service vehicle standards. In pursuing the development of improved vehicle standards and the commitment regarding wheelchair accessible taxis, the aim will be to accommodate the greatest possible range of people, including those who suffer from mobility and sensory difficulties. In pursuing that agenda, the commission may consider the approach to the deployment of wheelchair accessible taxis and the standards applied to such vehicles in other EU states. The commission will also determine the manner and timeframe for the implementation of the policy of accessible taxi services.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_823">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</from>
          <p eId="para_1393">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 132 and 142 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">Last year, the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public private partnership, PPP, with phase 1 including a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport. Since then the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has concentrated its work on developing proposals for this phase. A preliminary public consultation has taken place and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders was launched by the RPA in mid-2002 which met with an enthusiastic international response – 18 companies have already been pre-qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">In November 2002, my Department received the outline business case, OBC, for phase 1 of the Metro from the RPA. Given the size of the project, careful consideration of the OBC was undertaken. The estimated costs were substantial and I asked for a number of additional aspects of the proposal to be further examined. These additional aspects concerned the cost of the project and its potential impact on the general Government balance in the context of the EU Stability and Growth Pact and the legal, planning and technical considerations based on practice elsewhere, particularly Madrid where the authorities have developed a strong international reputation for the speedy completion of the Madrid metro extensions at a relatively low cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">I received the RPA's formal response on these matters on Monday last. I expect the evaluation of the RPA's preferred solution to be completed shortly and to bring proposals to Government next month. A competitive procurement process will help to minimise the actual cost of the metro to the Exchequer. I am aware that the group mentioned in Deputy McManus's question, made a submission recently to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. The competition for the metro PPP is being conducted by the RPA in accordance with EU procurement rules and is open to suitably qualified companies. If the group believes that it has the technical and other resources required, then it should apply to the RPA to pre-qualify for the construction of the metro, in the same way as other interested parties have done. The RPA will be producing a public sector comparator for the metro proposals, with this comparator being used as a benchmark against the bids received.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_146">On public sector financing, the OBC provided a range of financing options for consideration by the Government. While up-front capital funding by the Exchequer can reduce the interest costs of the PPP consortium, it also reduces the level of financing risk being transferred by the State to the private sector. In the area of VAT, it was  assumed for the purposes of the financing model used in the original OBC that it would be a cost to the private sector. However, the OBC, as with the public sector financing issue, provided a number of options for the Government. These options are refined further in the latest information I have received from the RPA. The eventual mix of public and private funding for the project and the treatment of issues such as VAT, will be decided in the context of what provides best value for money for the State.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">Additional Luas lines and extensions to the existing lines are contained within the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy. Their alignments and roll-out will be determined to a large extent by how the metro is developed. In the context of the proposed Metro providing a connection between St. Stephen's Green and line A, an additional parallel surface link would not be justified. Any additional Luas lines or extensions would require a new railway order.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1406">Penalty points for speeding have been operating since 31 October 2002. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407">Since 1 June 2003, penalty points are applicable to those convicted of driving without insurance. I am also in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the gardaí for the purpose of applying the system to seat belt offences committed by drivers from July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">The full application of penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department, Equality and Law Reform and the gardaí are developed. I understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that those systems will be in place by the middle of 2004. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_150">Penalty points are endorsed on the licence record held in the national driver file upon conviction for a speeding or insurance offence, or upon payment of a fixed charge for speeding. In the case of speeding offences, the system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. The 56 day period comprises an initial 28 day period within which €80 fixed charge can be paid, followed by a further 28 day period within which a fixed  charge of €120 can be paid. If a person opts not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing. There is, therefore, an inevitable and intrinsic time lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the endorsement of penalty points. The fact that, at present, the processing of notices by the gardaí is operated on a manual basis, is a further contributory factor to those time lapses. This may result in a number of cases where drivers have been detected, but the points have yet to be endorsed on the licence record. The timing of the issue of fixed charge notices is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</summary>

This budget was subsequently revised in February 2001 to €675 million to take account of actual competition tender prices received, reflecting high inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project, mainly related to the provision for upgrading Line B to metro status. Capital funding for construction of the lines, estimated currently at €691 million, is in place and the RPA has also made provision for risk. For contractual reasons, I do not wish to give any further details of the risk provision as to do so could prejudice ongoing negotiations with contractors in this regard.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1431">The strategic rail review, which I published last April, provides the Government with a policy framework for the future development of rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">With regard to the greater Dublin area, the review recognises the significant growth potential of rail in the region. The report recommends that Iarnród Éireann should aim for a turn up and go service on the Dublin suburban rail network. It also envisages that the four main rail corridors, Kildare, Maynooth, the north-eastern and south eastern corridors, should give commuters the type of service which will make their travel more attractive, speedy and reliable. As part of this initiative the construction of a new station at Spencer Dock, widening of rail corridors on the approach to Heuston and Connolly stations and the construction of an interconnector tunnel linking the proposed new Spencer Dock station with Heuston and Pearse stations are recommended.</p>

          <p eId="para_1481">It is my general policy that the three State airports should be in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of users consistent with a commercial mandate. There are two main issues in An Agreed Programme for Government relating to the future of Aer Rianta and the three State airports. These are the proposals concerning greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork Airports and the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">My Department is currently finalising a process of consultation with relevant interested parties and stakeholders in relation to both these issues. Following this consultation process it is my intention to continue discussions at Government in relation to both of these major initiatives as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">With regard to the development of Cork and Shannon Airports, significant investment has been made by Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport in recent years in developing facilities for passengers and cargo. Following the completion of the terminal extension, Shannon now has capacity to handle up to 4.5 million passengers per annum. In the case of Cork Airport significant investment, estimated to cost €140 million, is about to commence which will involve the construction of a new terminal building, a new multi-storey car park, upgraded surface car-parking facilities and significantly improved internal road systems. The company expects that the new terminal will be operational in 2005.</p>

          <p eId="para_1485">No precise estimates are readily available of the cost of traffic congestion in Dublin to the business community. The DTO has estimated that the cost of delays to the travelling public is in excess of €2 billion per annum. As regards bus operators, the DTO has estimated that 25% of the operating costs of bus companies in Dublin is attributable to congestion.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_172">The Government has been pro-active in its response to the challenge of traffic congestion in Dublin through unprecedented levels of investment. Within the national development plan, a wide range of initiatives have been taken to  upgrade transport infrastructure and services and to reduce congestion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy document, A Platform for Change 2000 – 2016, sets out an integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area for the period up to 2016. The strategy aims to reduce congestion and to increase the modal share of public transport through infrastructure and service improvements and to reduce the growth in travel through the application of land use and other policies and to encourage a transfer of trips, particularly at peak periods, from the private car to sustainable modes of transport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_174">Much of the improvements envisaged in A Platform for Change are already being implemented. These include the M50, the Dublin port tunnel, quality bus corridors, the introduction of the Luas while proposals regarding the development of a metro are being further advanced by my Department. A major improvement in rail capacity in the greater Dublin area is under way with a doubling of the number of DART cars in service by 2004-05 and a major increase in the capacity of outer suburban rail also.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_175">My Department's Statement of Strategy 2003-2005 sets out a framework for further expanding the capacity and improving the quality of the public transport system in order to reduce congestion further.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_177">In the case of national road projects, I understand that as part of the PPP assessment process for an individual project undertaken by the NRA, a risk assessment is undertaken which identifies and quantifies the significant risks likely to arise on the project and considers their optimum allocation between the public and private sector. This exercise results in a risk matrix showing where it is proposed to allocate risks. The main risk areas likely to arise on a road project are design inaccuracies and errors, construction time and cost over-runs, underestimation of maintenance and  reinvestment costs and incorrect estimation of traffic volumes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">The key to achieving maximum value for money in PPP projects is to allocate risk to the party which can best manage it. In the case of national roads, risks and costs in relation to design, construction, maintenance, traffic volumes and operation costs are carried by the concessionaire while risks in relation to statutory procedures – environmental impact statements and compulsory purchase order approvals – are retained by the NRA. In assessing value for money, the NRA prepares a financial comparator, representing the cost under traditional procurement, which is compared to the cost to the public sector under a PPP arrangement to assess which offers better value for money. This value for money comparison is undertaken at different stages of the PPP procurement process. At the final stage, the best and final offer submission which has been judged most economically advantageous is compared against the financial comparator to confirm that a toll-based PPP offers better value for money. The financial comparator includes an estimated cost for risks that would remain with the public sector if the project was procured under traditional procurement procedures.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1504">I sought legal advice from the Attorney General's Office prior to the Transport Council about the decision-making process in relation to the granting of a mandate to the European Commission to negotiate an open aviation area agreement with the United States. I referred to that advice, which was not finalised at the time, in a reply to a parliamentary question on 21 May 2003. The legal advice has now been finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">The advice regarding the granting of a mandate is that there is an arguable, but not certain, case that the agreement of all member states may have been necessary. As I stated in my earlier reply, however, I decided that it was not realistic to contemplate that any member state would refuse to permit the other member states of the Union to engage in multilateral negotiations with the United States on a matter it wished to pursue on a multilateral basis. Accordingly, I did not object to the granting of the mandate to the Commission. The advice regarding the draft EU-US agreement that will emerge from the negotiations between the European Commission and the United States is that if the agreement contains elements of national competence, as well as elements of Community competence, it will require the assent of all member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">As I have stated already in earlier replies and debates on this matter, I will carefully assess the draft agreement which ultimately emerges from the negotiations, in particular its impact on Shannon Airport as well as for Irish tourism, business and aviation generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_1536">I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 277 and 284 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537">I expect that all the projects in the public transport sector, which are being funded under the national development plan, will be completed. While some projects may run beyond the time limit of the plan, it is not possible to identify them at this stage as completion of the NDP programme will be dependent on funding levels and the prevailing budgetary and economic situation over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538">The very significant Exchequer allocation to my Department for 2003 in respect of the provision of transport infrastructure clearly demonstrates the Government's strong ongoing commitment to the NDP programme and to maintaining a high level of investment in infrastructural projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">Significant progress has also been achieved during the past year on the NDP airports measure. The completion of relevant projects within the targeted timescale is the responsibility of the regional airports. It is anticipated, however, that these projects will be completed broadly within the specified NDP budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">On national roads, the national development plan – Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme – provides for total investment of €6.748 billion over the period 2000-06. Investment over the period 2000-03, including the 2003 Estimates provision, will be approximately €3.96 billion.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_187">While good progress has been made on the NDP-mandated roads programme, progress has not been as great as had been originally planned. The upgrade programme is and remains ambitious but a number of factors over the past three years, including increased costs, combined with the changed economic and budgetary conditions, have impacted on the pace of its implementation. Some reprogramming by the NRA will therefore be required. As a result, the  ambitious upgrade programme provided for in the NDP may take somewhat longer to implement but the Government is committed to doing so.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_188">A mid-term evaluation of the NDP and the Economic and Social Infrastructural Operational Programme 2000-2006 is under way and it is expected that the report will be published before the end of 2003. The key objective of this evaluation is to provide an independent analysis of progress under the NDP-ESIOP and developments in the programme to date and to make recommendations for the remainder of the programme.</summary>

Sections of the Act that relate both directly and indirectly to the operation of penalty points were commenced with effect from the 31 October 2002 to facilitate the operation of the system in respect of speeding offences. In addition to the sections relating directly to the penalty points system – sections 2 to 7 – those sections relating to the introduction of a fixed charge system to replace the current on the spot fine system – section 11 – increases in the general penalties – section 23 – and the extension of the use of electronic equipment for the detection of offences – section 21 – were commenced with effect from 31 October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1547">The requirement for full and provisional licence holders to carry their licences as set out in section 18 of the Act, and a provision that local authorities can make arrangement for the functions conferred on traffic wardens to be carried out by persons employed by the authority, or persons authorised in writing to perform those functions – section 12(2) – have been commenced since 1 January 2003. Section 15 empowers local authorities to decide on the number and location of taxi stands and to govern their operation. This responsibility was previously vested in the Garda Commissioner with the consent of the Minister. I have signed a commencement order bringing this section into operation with effect from 1 February 2003. I have signed an order to provide for the introduction of penalty points for driving without insurance with effect from 1 June 2003.

That strategy has now completed its term and the Government is committed to the development of a new road safety strategy that will apply for the next three years.

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_858">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey):</from>
          <p eId="para_1575">I propose to take Questions Nos. 166, 168, 172, 174 and 175 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500, which amounts to a reduction of approximately 5,000 places phased over the year. The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects, including projects in Dublin and surrounding areas, is a matter for FÁS.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_205">Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions  and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which include personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. However, such places are subject to the normal eligibility requirements for the programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_206">I understand the difficulties being encountered by organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, which have difficulty in replacing participants due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. All health service related CE projects, including those sponsored by the Irish Wheelchair Association, have been ring-fenced from reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. During 2002 when CE places were reduced from 38,809 to 25,000, FÁS ensured that these designated health CE places were untouched and that the places were maintained as agreed. Therefore the reductions that have been reported by the IWA are not as a result of any reduction in CE places provided to this or other health service sponsors by FÁS. The sponsor is encouraged by FÁS to recruit replacements for those who leave having completed their full complement of time on CE. The current difficulties point to a shortage of CE applicants, increase in demand for such services from communities and a reduced capacity on behalf of the service provider to meet this demand in the absence of other resources to fill these posts with more long-term applicants. FÁS will endeavour to support such organisations within its remit.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_207">Funding amounting to €274.3 million is being provided for the administration of the CE programme during 2003 and €323.1 million was provided in 2002. This amounts to a reduction of €48.8 million this year. The cost of CE to the end of May 2003 is €120.4 million, which is a reduction of €22.6 million over the same period last year. CE expenditure in the Tallaght area is a matter for FÁS.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_208">A number of reviews of CE are currently under way. The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental group of senior officials has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes.</summary>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_861">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</from>
          <p eId="para_1584">Naturally, I am saddened at the closure of DESIGNyard, not only because it means Irish craft workers have lost a benevolent retail outlet also because it means a loss of employment by the staff involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1585">The decision to close DESIGNyard was made by its board. The funding of individual companies in the crafts sector is a matter for the Crafts Council of Ireland, and is not one in which I have a direct function. However, the Crafts Council of Ireland has informed me that there was a five-year agreement between it and DESIGNyard on foot of which DESIGNyard received a declining sum per annum. This was factored on the premise that DESIGNyard would become financially viable over the period. The agreement concluded at the end of December 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586">I am informed that the board of the CCoI received a request from the board of DESIGNyard for an extension of the five-year agreement and that the CCoI board considered this matter in light of an independent report prepared for the DESIGNyard board, and paid for by Enterprise Ireland. The report noted that international comparable models show that the areas in which DESIGNyard operated are more usually served by craft galleries in the private retail sector. In reaching its decision, the board of CCoI was sensitive to the fact that other galleries provide services similar to those of DESIGNyard, and promote and sell Irish craft and design without any State subvention.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_211">The report outlined a number of options, many of which would have involved a major strategic change for DESIGNyard. It was of considerable relevance to the CCoI decision that the option pursued by DESIGNyard's board, following its  receipt of the report, was that it continue to deliver its original objectives, without any substantial strategic change, despite the increase in private sector provision for retailing craft in Dublin and the changes in the general market conditions in which Irish craft sales are currently being made.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">During most of the term of the agreement between the CCoI and DESIGNyard from 1998 to 2002, the consumer market was expanding. The board concluded that, if the €330,000 received by DESIGNyard in a period of retail expansion had not made its retail activity self-sufficient, a further injection of Exchequer funding in a period of slowdown was highly unlikely to do so. Again, the board would have also been influenced by the appropriateness of using State funding to support a non-profit retailer with direct private sector competitors trading close by. This had not been the position in 1997 when the agreement was established. For these reasons and in the light of the ongoing funding requirements and other council funding priorities, I am informed that the board of CCoI decided that it was not in a position to offer further funding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_213">In looking at the potential impact of DESIGNyard on Irish craft, the board of CCoI took into consideration that DESIGNyard's 2001 sales of craft and design represented 0.4% of the total sales of Irish craft in that year. The fact that a very significant proportion of annual DESIGNyard turnover was not based on Irish-made craft and design but on sales derived from jewellery supplied by European manufacturers meant that the potential loss to indigenous manufacturers was even less than 0.4%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_214">In reaching its difficult decision, the board of CCoI fully acknowledged that DESIGNyard has played an important role in developing the contemporary jewellery market in Dublin and also in encouraging commissioned work in a broad range of craft-based media. The council is particularly disappointed at the loss to Ireland of one of Europe's leading contemporary jewellery galleries. The Irish consumer was able to benchmark the standards of Irish design against its European counterpart and be reassured that they were not found wanting.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_215">It is the council's hope that the private sector will now rise to the challenge and replicate such a gallery on a similar commercial footing as is found in other European capital cities.</summary>

The term disadvantaged areas is used in my Department to describe the rural areas of the country which exhibit permanent natural handicaps that prevent farmers from earning a reasonable income from the land, and/or are in danger of depopulation. Some 75% of the land area of the state is designated as disadvantaged. Within this designation, there are two categories – less severely handicapped which accounts for 16% of land area, and more severely handicapped which accounts for 59% of land area. The general conditions for designating areas as disadvantaged are laid down in Council Directive EEC/75/268. The specific criteria which apply in Ireland are contained in Council Directive EEC/85/350. Within Council Directive EEC/75/268, member states are authorised to pay compensatory allowances to farmers in areas designated as disadvantaged, and are further permitted to vary the amount of payments depending on the degree of the handicap.

          <p eId="para_1606">The person named applied for premium on 26 cows and five heifers under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 1 March 2002. Payment of his 80% advance instalment issued on 16 October 2002. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme, an applicant who has applied on 14 animals or more must continue to own, possess, hold and maintain on his holding during the six month retention period, a number of suckler cows at least equal to 60% and at most equal to 85%, and a number of heifers at least equal to 15% and at most equal to 40% of the total number of animals for which premium has been requested, or acceptable replacements for those animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607">When processing the application for balance payment, it was found in the case of the person named that one of the heifers applied on, tag no. 181725680036, had calved during the retention period, leaving only four heifers. In order to maintain the 15% ratio, this heifer would require a replacement. The question of whether the animal was replaced requires investigation and will be dealt with as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608">The person named applied for premium on 14 animals under the 2002 special beef premium scheme. Advance payments, at a rate of 80% of premium, have issued in respect of these animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609">The person named qualified for premium in respect of 21 animals under the slaughter premium scheme 2002. One of the animals was a beef breed heifer under 30 months of age at slaughter, and is therefore also eligible under the national envelope top-up. The 80% advance payment has issued under both schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1610">Under new control regulations introduced by the EU with effect from 1 January 2002 for the imposition of penalties, it is necessary to process all bovine premia scheme applications at producer level rather than individual scheme application level. This means that the 20% balancing payment for all the schemes mentioned above cannot issue until the suckler cow premium problem has been resolved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1640">I assume the Deputy is referring to allocations of quota from the national reserves. The criteria for obtaining quota from the national reserve are proposed each year by the quota review group and adopted with or without amendments by me having regard to EU regulations governing the quota regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">The criteria that applied in respect of the 2003 suckler cow quota national reserve were as follows: there were four categories A, B, C, D under which farmers could apply for an allocation of quota but a farmer could only apply under one category; category A catered for first time applicants for suckler cow premium in 2003 who were under 35 years of age on 1 January 2002; farmers who applied for the suckler cow premium for the first time in 2002 could also apply under this category provided they satisfied the age criteria; category B catered for farmers with holdings on off-shore islands where at least 50% of the forage area of the holding was located on the island; category C catered for organic farmers who were registered with the Department on or before 29 June 2002; and category D catered for farmers who were regular applicants for the suckler cow premium and who would be applying in 2003 and who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holdings.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_219">The total annual income of a farmer including that of his/her spouse/partner, applicable under all categories could not exceed €25,600. Any off-farm income for the period 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001 included in the total income could not exceed €9,525. In respect of categories  A, C and D only, the total number of livestock units on the holding could not exceed 50. There were only some 1,500 suckler cow premium rights available for distribution from the 2003 national reserve. Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the quota review group and EU regulations as follows: (i) 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for category B applicants – farmers with holdings on offshore islands; (ii) 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for category C applicants – organic farmers; (iii) the remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under category A – first time applicants under 35 years of age who under EU rules had to be given priority. As a result there was no quota left to allocate to any applicant under category D, i.e. farmers who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">Due to the large number of rights available for distribution in the 2003 ewe premium national reserve, quota was allocated to all qualifying applicants. Reserve quota was not allocated to farmers who had commonage where certain restrictions on ewe numbers applied.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1719">Both the IMF and the World Bank produce copious information in written form on their activities, much of this being released on their relevant websites, which give information on their contacts with member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">In July 2002, Ireland Aid and the Department of Finance published a joint debt strategy. This updates and develops the Government's position on the debt crisis that was issued in September 1998.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_227">The strategy raises a number of concerns about the operation of the HIPC initiative such as the adequacy of the existing level of debt relief and the projections and assumptions used in the calculation of sustainable debt levels. The bank and the IMF have admitted that a significant number of the countries emerging from the HIPC process will continue to have unsustainable debt levels. Ireland also believes that  the impact of HIV-AIDS on the economies of HIPC countries should be taken into account in assessing debt relief. The poverty reduction and growth facility is also being reviewed by the IMF.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">Since the launch of the debt strategy document, we have had consultations in Washington with the World Bank and the IMF and have discussed with them our views on the progress of the HIPC initiative, on the issue of debt cancellation and other issues. We have also briefied Canada, the leader of our constituency at the Bretton Woods institutions, on our ideas. The Taoiseach reiterated our commitment in principle to debt cancellation in his address to the World Summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in October 2002. The Taoiseach also gave a lecture at the World Bank recently which outlined our concerns. Ireland participated in a World Bank meeting convened to discuss the current financing gap that has arisen in the HIPC trust fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_229">We will continue to monitor closely developments in the HIPC initiative process and to participate actively in all relevant international meetings. Our debt strategy will guide us as we seek to ensure that the HIPC countries' efforts to achieve the millennium development goals are not inhibited by a continuing high level of debt and that a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill is secured.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_230">At the launch of the Government's "Policy on Developing Country Debt", Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, announced a commitment of £1.5 million over three years, to support the activities of Debt Relief International, a non-profit making organisation which helps countries to manage their borrowing and their existing debts.

This amendment, in essence condemned, the US economic embargo. However, Ireland and many other countries took the view that the amendment was inappropriate to a human rights context. The amendment was defeated with 17 votes in favour, 24 opposed and ten abstentions.</p>

The centre became operational in October 2002 has a three year work plan and has the following remit: To establish a national quality framework for early childhood education in all its aspects which is capable of being applied in the various settings in which early education is provided; to develop targeted interventions for children up to six years who are disadvantaged or who have special needs, building on the experience of existing initiatives; and to lay the groundwork for the  establishment of an early childhood agency as envisaged by the White Paper.</summary>

The action group on access to third level education recommended that the various interventions at early childhood, primary and second level to address disadvantage be reviewed by the educational disadvantage committee. To date, the work of the committee has addressed many issues related to the integration and cohesion of service provision to students in greatest need. In addition, the outcomes from the Educational Disadvantage Forum have clearly signalled the need for an integrated and comprehensive policy framework for educational inclusion and for more coherent structures to be established, at both policy and operational levels. A report on the deliberations and discussions of the forum has recently been presented to me.</summary>

I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups – mature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities – in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_243">The action group has recommended the setting of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, on students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disability. A specific objective of the national office will be to monitor and evaluate the targets for the three target groups which have been set for 2003 and 2006, as recommended by the action group's report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_244">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited, ADM, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. ADM Limited which is continuing to administer the fund, notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. The experience to date suggests that the fund has acted as a catalyst for the development of a more co-ordinated approach at local level. Linkages have been made across a diverse range of groups and agencies representative of the community and voluntary sector, and the statutory providers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">I am committed to progressing the recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that when the current Government first came into office in 1997, spending on third level access measures totalled €508,000. In 2002, this had risen to €23.98 million which represents, by any standards, a quantum leap in committed resources. The 2003 provision is €26 million.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_1786">I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 to 224, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">The report of the action group on access to third level education was published in July 2001. The most significant spending recommendation of the report concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">Following the launch of the initiative, a commitment was given that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant would be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility and that a first step would be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the initiative in its first year of operation. It was also indicated at that time that the scheme would be extended to ensure that additional, suitably qualifying mature students would benefit from the special rates of maintenance grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">Early in 2002, a working group consisting of officials of local authorities and vocational education committees was established at my Department's request to inform the Department as to issues arising in the scheme's first year of operation. The review, which was carried out by Department officials, also had the benefit of input from the Department of Social and Family Affairs through the provision of statistical data and the presence of an official on the review group.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_248">Following this review, I implemented the recommendation that the threshold for the special rates of grants be set at an amount equal to the annualised maximum point of the 2001 social welfare old age contributory pension plus  the 2001 maximum qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 years. Accordingly, I increased the threshold to an annualised amount of €12,419, an increase of 32% over the 2001-02 threshold. The level at which this income threshold is set is being kept under review.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">Since its introduction, the calculation of reckonable income, for the purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant, has been net of the standard exclusions listed in the grant schemes and net of child dependant allowance, CDA, paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to €1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a top-up of €1,490 and €596, respectively, on the ordinary maintenance grant for eligible students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">As a result of the review, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students. Recent available figures show that this target was exceeded, with approximately 7,500 students receiving the top-up grant in 2002-03.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">On 25 May I announced a package of measures, costing €42 million in a full year, to address the problem of disadvantage in third level education. This package includes a commitment to increase the amount of top-up grant to the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance. Eligible students will receive in the 2003-04 academic year an overall grant of €4,493. This equates to a top-up amount of €1,606 for students residing more than 15 miles from college. This rate will have the added advantage of giving the benefit of the equivalent of the full rate of welfare assistance to the most disadvantaged students for the duration of the academic year, thereby removing one of the most significant financial disincentives to participation in higher education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_253">The student support unit of my Department issues annually a copy of the information booklet,Financial Support for Further and Higher Education, to guidance councillors in all second level schools. This booklet contains full details on the special rates of maintenance grant. Information on all aspects of financial support is also available on my Department's website and, at appropriate times, details of the maintenance grant schemes are advertised in both national and local newspapers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_254">In addition, as part of the €42 million package announced in May, I have made provision for €500,000 to provide for an effective campaign delivering clear and accessible information on entitlements to maximise the impact of public expenditure on the policy options I announced recently and to ensure that as far as possible all potential applicants are aware of the supports available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_255">It is normal practice to make the grant application forms available to applicants when the  terms and conditions of the grant schemes have been finalised and issued to the awarding bodies. It has not been possible to date to make the forms available at the same time as CAO application forms. The matter is being kept under review and it is my intention to have the schemes and application forms available at the earliest possible date each year.</summary>

Consideration has been given to a proposal that a transfer of responsibility for the operation of the maintenance grants schemes to a single agency or body, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, might be administratively more appropriate. This view has been endorsed by the Cromien report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.</p>

From the commencement of the 2003-04 school year, my Department will introduce mechanisms which will facilitate identification of the numbers of students accessing special education services at second level and the nature of the support services made available in such cases.

Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities.

Special needs assistant support is generally made available where the student has special care needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1894">A total of 380 wholetime equivalent special needs assistants and approximately 730 wholetime equivalent teaching posts are in place in the second level system to support students with special needs. The overall number of pupils at second level is 340,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1895">Precise details of the number of pupils in receipt of special needs assistant support are not readily available. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of special needs assistants rests with the relevant school authorities. Decisions on whether allocations of special needs assistant support are filled on a full-time of part-time basis are determined by the level of such support made available to the school and the availability of suitable persons to deliver the service. My Department does not have details of the number of individuals recruited by schools to deliver their approved level of special needs assistant support.</p>

          <p eId="para_1902">Pre-school education has a vital role to play in tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion. This was a central tenet of the Government's White Paper on Early Education, Ready to Learn, which was published in 1999. It outlines a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children from birth to six years. The principal objective of the White Paper is "to support the development and educational achievement of children through high quality early education, with particular focus on the target groups of the disadvantaged and those with special needs".</p>

A full-time director, assistant director and three development officers and administrative staff are now in place.

          <p eId="para_1904">In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1905">In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of €1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of €635. Approximately €2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1908">The junction boxes to which the Deputy refers are used for voltage regulation and signal amplification by cable television providers. The electric currents associated with these signals are small and the electromagnetic fields produced by the equipment are much less than those generated by a typical television set or even an electric door-bell.</p>
          <p eId="para_1909">Concerning those individuals who suffer a variety of neurasthenic symptoms which they attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields, a major investigation of such claims was undertaken by the EU in 1997, in which Ireland participated. This investigation did not find an association between the symptoms reported and the presence of an electromagnetic field.</p>
          <p eId="para_1910">There have now been a total of 13 different studies under controlled laboratory conditions where electrosensitive people were exposed to electromagnetic fields similar to those to which they attributed their symptoms. In these studies the ability of an individual with electrosensitivity to determine whether the field was on or off was no more accurate than if the decision were based on guessing. Studies on electrosensitivity are continuing and are a priority for research identified by the World Health Organisation's international EMF project, in which Ireland is an active participant.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_932">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1964">There is no precise legal definition of disadvantage, disadvantaged area or disadvantaged community in the legislation under the remit of my Department. Section 45(1) of the Health Act 1970 sets out in broad terms categories of persons who will have full eligibility for health services. Under this Act, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, aside from people over the age of 70 years who are automatically entitled to a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1965">The Deputy will appreciate that, in the area of an individual's health, a flexible understanding of disadvantage is required. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1966">My Department participates in the RAPID and CLÁR programmes and, in so doing, accepts the definitions of disadvantaged areas used by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. In its 2003 letters of determination to each health board and in other correspondence to the health board chief executive officers, my Department has asked each health board to prioritise its funding allocations in favour of RAPID and CLÁR projects wherever possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1967">The National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, includes the targets to reduce health inequalities which were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process for the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. NAPS, for which the lead Department is Social and Family Affairs, is underpinned by the following definition of poverty:</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_271">People are living in poverty if their income and resources (material, cultural and social) are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. As a result of  inadequate income and resources people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people in society.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_272">This definition recognises the multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of poverty and exclusion and provides a coherent and integrated framework to address issues of disadvantage across a range of policy domains including health and personal social services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_273">This approach has enabled greater recognition of the social determinants of health and in particular of the links which research has shown to exist between poverty and health inequalities. This need for a whole system approach to health and health inequalities is emphasised in the national health strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_274">The report of the working group on the national anti-poverty strategy and health emphasised the importance of a community development approach to reducing health inequalities, that is, involving communities in needs assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring-evaluation. Under action 54 of the national health strategy, the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, last November published guidelines which set out a range of ways for the health sector to engage with communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_275">In this regard, my Department recently co-hosted a conference with the Combat Poverty Agency to launch its building healthy communities programme, which has a special focus on community development approaches to reducing health inequalities. My Department is also supporting financially, in the context of the implementation of the primary care strategy, a number of research projects under the aegis of the building healthy communities programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2017">My Department has recently advised the Not for Profit Business Association of an additional allocation of €5.85 million to relieve the under-funding position of its member organisations. Further claims amounting to more than €5 million have been made by the association and these claims are being considered by my Department in consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the association itself, having regard to the availability of funds. Additional claims for extra staff numbers will also be considered in the light of available resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_2018">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2097">The definition of "disadvantage" denotes being without the advantages of a socially secure and economically stable home-community life. Being without those attributes of living that permit participation in society and being able to avail of normal opportunities is to be disadvantaged. In this sense, the term is very close to the definition of poverty as used in the national anti-poverty strategy:</p>
          <p eId="para_2098">People are living in poverty if their income and resources (material, cultural and social) are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. As a result of inadequate income and resources, people may be excluded from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_2099">The concept of disadvantage is also similar to that of social exclusion and marginalisation. The National Development Plan 2000-2006, refers to "urban and rural black spots"– par. 2.2, p. 33 – and to "pockets of poverty and disadvantage that are evident throughout both Regions"– par. 3.12, p. 41. It concludes that "offenders, both male and female, generally come from the most disadvantaged groups in society", and they "therefore experience multiple disadvantages which accumulate leading to economic and social exclusion and to an extreme form of marginalisation from the labour market"–  par. 10.26, p. 194. As the probation and welfare service operates a number of sub-measures with the national development plan, it adopts and implements this conceptual framework.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_296">The actual determination of disadvantaged areas and communities is not a matter for criminal justice alone. Other bodies, such as national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, and the Combat Poverty Agency have produced studies documenting levels and degrees of disadvantage. The 25 areas chosen under the RAPID, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, 1 programme, and further trenches in RAPID 2  and CLÁR, for the location of new service facilities or projects operating under the aegis of the service are univocally high crime areas, also almost by definition a RAPID or CLÁR, Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais, area. As only limited funds are available, some facilities are sited in central locations that can serve two or more disadvantaged areas. In these ways, social inclusion is promoted, marginalisation is reduced, and the incidence of repeat offending cut back, all in the same process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_297">Under the remit of my Department, garda youth diversion projects target young people aged between ten and 18 years of age who are likely to drop out of the educational system prematurely with high quality intervention programmes in areas of acute social disadvantage. Members of the target group are likely to be from families where there is a history of early school leaving; have poor literacy skills; be disadvantaged socially often as a result of alcoholism, drug addiction, and poor parenting skills; have little or no scope of entering regular skilled employment; be unable to access mainstream education and training programmes; and be at risk of becoming chronically unemployable, with inevitable entry into vandalism, crime, drugs and finally prison.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_298">As part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06 assesses grant applications based on recognised socio-economic indicators. It also takes cognisance of the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area in which the proposed service is located and the social groupings which the service will support. Particular attention is paid to those services based in identified RAPID and CLÁR areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_299">Area Development Management Limited, which administers the equal opportunities childcare programme in partnership with my Department, carries out a technical assessment of each application which includes an analysis of the degree of disadvantage in each case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_300">A portion of the funding under the equality for women measure of the national development plan is targeted at disadvantaged women. These are broadly defined as women who are in poverty or experiencing social exclusion and who belong to one or more of the following target groups: lone parents, women who have experienced domestic violence, women drug mis-users, women involved in street prostitution, women with disability, Traveller women and ethnic minority women.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2101">The recent report of the working group reviewing the coroners' service recommended the rationalisation of the number of cor oners and the establishment of a regional coroner's structure rather than the present county-subcounty structure. The report also recommended that the rationalisation of coroners numbers be achieved by not filling coroner vacancies as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_2102">In this regard vacancies are not being filled pending a decision on the recommendations in the report on the basis that if these vacancies were filled it would jeopardise any rationalisation of the service.

          <p eId="para_2105">As these institutions also accommodate offenders over 18 years of age, the information sought by the Deputy is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources. However, the annual cost of keeping a young offender in the prison institutions which catered solely for the 16 to 21 year old age category for 2000 and 2001 is as follows:</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</from>
          <p eId="para_2132">I assume the Deputy is referring to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) launched by my Department in April 2000. The EOCP is a seven year programme with the principal aims of increasing the number of child care facilities and places, enhancing the quality of child care services and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven year period of the programme is €437 million, including €317.4 million provided under the national development plan, co-funded by the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_2133">The equal opportunities child care programme has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of men and women in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_2134">The programme provides capital grant assistance to community-not for profit organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. It offers staffing grants to community based-not for profit organisations which have a focus on disadvantaged families and offers supports to the national voluntary child care organisations and to other groups working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_303">The equal opportunities child care programme is making a real difference. Since the availability of funding under the equal opportunities child care programme was formally announced in April 2000, funding of nearly €172 million has been  committed to more than 1,633 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sectors. It is estimated that, on completion of these projects, more than 46,800 child care places will be supported by this funding including the creation of more than 23,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_304">In addition, funding of more than €25 million has been approved for quality improvement projects such as the county child care committees, the national voluntary child care organisations and innovative projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_305">Each application for funding towards staffing costs is appraised separately, and on its own merits, against a range of criteria specified under the programme. The criteria include,inter alia, the scope of the project, the socio-demographic profile of the area, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the group to implement the project, the level of integration of the project with other facilities in the area and the value for money which the project represents. All applications are assessed initially by Area Development Management Limited, which works in partnership with my Department. Following the ADM assessment, each application is considered by a programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a final recommendation to me. Support towards staffing costs is only made available to community based projects that clearly demonstrate that they are addressing the child care needs of disadvantaged families, assisting parents who are in employment or partaking in education or training opportunities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_306">I am sure the Deputy will agree the financial assistance towards staffing made available under the programme must be targeted at those services that have a clear focus on meeting the child care needs of disadvantaged families. As the EOCP is very much a developmental programme it is necessary to constantly monitor the outcomes and impacts of the funding allocated and it is for this reason staffing grants are generally allocated on a fixed term contract basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2168">There are almost 900 civilian clerical and administrative staff employed as a support to the Garda Síochána.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_309">In November, 1997 the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency  and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. That review was conducted in the framework of the Strategic Management Initiative across the public service. The report contained a number of recommendations requiring a more comprehensive development of issues relating to the organisation, operations, financing and performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_310">The report recognised the potential for further civilianisation within the force. It stated that the concept behind the introduction of civilianisation was to allow for certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and to free up gardaí for work more suited to their training and development, while at the same time increasing the operational capacity of the force.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_311">In January, 1998 the Government established a new Garda SMI implementation steering group to develop the report's recommendations for implementation. To this end, a bottom-up review group was established to focus on organisation structures-systems and the deployment of operational resources and to bring recommendations to the steering group in the areas for which it was responsible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_312">As the Deputy will be aware, in October 2001 the Government approved the report on civilianisation in the Garda Síochána which recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. These posts are located in Garda headquarters, in the Garda college and in districts and divisions throughout the State.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_313">The civilianisation report also provides for the transfer of finance functions from the Garda district clerks to civilians, and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer. In this regard, an office notice issued on 12 June 2003 to invite applications from clerical officers to compete for the posts.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_314">A working group, comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána and my Department is overseeing implementation of the report. It is envisaged that the posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over several years. To commence this process, 65 posts have been identified and it is envisaged the remaining posts will thereafter be civilianised on a phased basis.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2171">The board may review the cases of prisoners sentenced to determinate sentences of eight years or more but less than 14 years when the prisoner has served half of the sentence, and the cases of prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more or life sentences after 7 years have been served of the sentence.

          <p eId="para_2182">I understand that intruder alarms gave rise to 11% of the noise complaints made to Dublin City Council in 2001, the third lowest of all categories of complaints listed. Nevertheless, I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise. A number of arrangements are in place to reduce the incidence of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</p>
          <p eId="para_2183">The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published a voluntary standards specification IS. 199 of 1987 and operates a certification scheme to that standard, which, <i>inter alia,</i> specifies a minimum 15 minutes and maximum 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings with the alarms being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, <i>inter alia,</i> on the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2184">A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all current national standards, incorporates considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum. This standard will be applied by the NSAI for new installations from September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2185">Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_315">In addition, I understand the Private Security Services Bill 2001, sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and which has completed Second Stage in the Dáil, provides for the establishment of the private security authority to control and supervise persons providing security services, including services in relation to intruder alarm systems, and to maintain and improve services in the provision by them of those services. It is envisaged that the authority will operate a licensing system and will, taking account of the character and competence of applicants, grant licences to eligible persons.

In relation to disadvantaged areas, strand II of the RAPID programme is targeted at provincial towns with areas of particular disadvantage. These towns were identified with special  reference to the extent of local authority housing and other relevant indicators, such as levels of educational attainment and the Trutz Haase index of deprivation. Ministerial responsibility for the entire RAPID programme, including strand II, now rests with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_975">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</from>
          <p eId="para_2212">One of the objectives of the national development plan is the fostering of balanced regional development. In so far as my Department is concerned, this involves the implementation under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme and the two regional operational programmes of measures including social housing, water and waste water services, waste management, urban and village development, habitat protection and conservation and heritage conservation. Expenditure on these measures in the BMW region from the commencement of the national development plan in January 2000 to end 2002 amounted to €1.88 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_2213">The economic and social infrastructure operational programme, in which provision for social housing and water services is included, provides for an integrated package of investments in national infrastructure to meet infrastructural deficits that need to be overcome if Ireland's recent economic and social progress is to be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_2214">I am satisfied that the BMW region has benefited from the investment to date under both of the operational programmes. Expenditure for the provision of water infrastructure in the BMW region was 6.5% ahead of projection at the end of 2002. The water services investment programme for 2002-04, which was launched in April 2002, includes water infrastructure projects in the BMW region with a value of some €1.45 billion, including €375 million for projects new to the programme at that stage. Expenditure on housing, at just under €825 million, was 14% ahead of projection at the end of 2002 in the BMW region.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_319">Recognising the important role played by non-national roads in the BMW region's economic and social life, and the predominantly rural character of the region, over €505 million has been spent on these roads from January 2000 to the end of 2002. The overall provision under the  national development plan for non-national roads in the BMW region is over €1.07 billion. The particular development needs of the BMW region continue to be addressed by the Government's commitment, in its programme of June 2002, to continue with the programme of investment in non-national roads up to 2005 and to follow this with a further significant improvement programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_320">I have made allocations amounting to over €22 million under the waste management capital grants scheme. This is a national scheme which is provided for in the regional operational programmes and which is managed by the regional assemblies. Applications from local authorities for assistance under this scheme are evaluated on the basis of their potential contribution to the provisions of the relevant county-regional waste management plan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_321">Expenditure in the period January 2000 to end 2002 on urban and village renewal in the BMW region has amounted to €10.2 million. A further €4.7 million has been provided for projects in 2003. The aim of this measure is to provide financial support for a range of interventions to upgrade cities, towns and villages to make them more attractive places in which to live and work, to encourage social and economic development and to facilitate and support the development of tourism and tourism-related activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_322">In the BMW region, a sum of €3.8 million has been allocated under the habitat protection and conservation measure for the development of a visitor centre for Ballycroy National Park in County Mayo. A site for the centre has been purchased and the project has been brought to an advanced stage by a working group representative of my Department, the Office of Public Works, Mayo County Council and local community development and tourism interests. Under the heritage protection measure, work has commenced on a total of nine sites in the BMW region, with conservation, access or presentation improvements completed on seven.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_323">Overall, I am satisfied that the level of investment under the measures outlined above will continue to contribute to the development of the BMW region. I look forward to the outcome of the mid-term review of the national development programme, which is expected in the latter part of this year and which will provide an independent analysis of progress, including progress in relation to balanced regional development, and make appropriate recommendations for programme adjustments where necessary.</summary>

Expenditure on the scheme has increased from €13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to €52.6 million for 5,932 grants in 2002. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from €6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost €31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002.

          <p eId="para_2240">The Deputy will be aware that there is no single statutory definition of the terms disadvantage, disadvantaged area or disadvantaged community. The indicators of disadvantage used in relation to those programmes operated by my Department are described below.</p>
          <p eId="para_2241">Under the local development social inclusion programme, the areas within the boundaries of each of the 38 area partnerships are designated as disadvantaged. The selection of these areas was based on objective criteria, such as the levels of social welfare dependency, unemployment and educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_2242">While many area partnerships also include areas designated under the RAPID programme, given the specifically focused nature of the RAPID Programme, different criteria were used to select these areas for priority attention. The selection of the 25 RAPID areas in strand I was made on objective criteria using the Trutz Haase index of deprivation, supported by other factors such as unemployment, income levels, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing. The identification of towns to be included in RAPID strand II was also done on the basis of objective criteria, including educational attainment and social housing.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_329">The Trutz Haase index of deprivation was also used to determine which areas should be prioritised in identifying areas for new community development projects. These are operated under the Department's community development programmes which provide financial assistance to fund community development projects in disadvantaged areas and also provide support for self-help work in specific target groups that experi ence disadvantage such as disadvantaged women and men, lone parents, Travellers and other groups.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_330">The 14 local drugs task force areas in Dublin, Cork and Bray were selected on the basis of the level of drug misuse, particularly heroin, in those areas. The task forces, established in 1997, comprise a partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors. The new regional drugs task forces will be based in all health board regions throughout the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_331">The young people's facilities and services fund operates in areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop in the 14 local drugs task force areas and the four other urban centres of Waterford, Carlow, Limerick and Galway. This fund was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_332">While urban locations have been identified as having the most concentrated areas of disadvantage by reference to the above criteria, a key manifestation of disadvantage in rural communities is that of dispersed and declining populations. The White Paper on Rural Development, "Ensuring the Future – A Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland", defines disadvantaged communities as "those displaying high levels of poverty and social exclusion". It is recognised that social exclusion in rural areas is frequently the result of multiple disadvantage and can be experienced in relation to education, employment and training, transport and mobility and physical isolation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_333">Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government gave a commitment for targeted investment programmes in both urban and rural disadvantaged areas. The RAPID programme referred to above is the urban strand of this commitment while CLÁR is the rural strand. The 16 areas originally selected for inclusion in the CLÁR programme, Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais, launched in October 2001, were those that suffered the greatest population decline between 1926 and 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula, which was included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The average population loss in these regions was 50%. CLÁR is a targeted investment programme in rural areas and complements both the RAPID programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_334">Following an analysis of the 2002 population census data, the CLÁR areas were reviewed and extended arising from the commitment in the agreed programme for Government. As a result, the population that benefits from the revised  CLÁR programme was increased from 284,000 to 362,000.</summary>

Under the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-2006, funds of the order of €437 million have been provided with the overall objective of both improving the standard of child care services available, increasing the numbers of places available and co-ordinating development in the area of child care generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_2247">With regard to assistance for naíonraí, Foras na Gaeilge provides funding for Forbairt Naíonraí Teoranta, FNT, An Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta and Altram to provide various services in relation to naíonraí. In this jurisdiction, advisors are employed by An Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta to provide advice, facilities and training for directors of naíonraí. In 2002, An Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta provided €650,000 for naíonraí outside the Gaeltacht areas. Altram provides a similar range of supports in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_2248">Foras na Gaeilge recognises pre-schooling in Irish as of critical importance to the revitalisation of the language. In addition to the funding it provides annually, Foras na Gaeilge plays an active part – alongside the naíonraí themselves – in An Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_335">In terms of the Gaeltacht, it may be noted that Údarás na Gaeltachta administers a scheme  which subvents the running costs associated with naíonraí by way of an annual grant payable to eligible groups. This scheme provided funding of €327,552 in 2002, which was paid to 75 naíonraí and catered for approximately 1,000 children. It should also be noted that my Department offers small grants to naíonraí in Gaeltacht areas for the provision of equipment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_336">A number of studies on the influence of naíonraí have been completed in the recent past. The Institiúd Teangeolaíochta Éireann study "Early Immersion Education in Ireland – Na Naíonraí" in 1997 suggests that children whose first language is not Irish make significant advances in Irish during their period in the naíonra, which leads to increased use of Irish in the homes as well, as their parents try to help them in their efforts to acquire the language.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2250">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2251">Rent supplements, which are subject to a means test, are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_2252">The South-Western Area Health Board has advised that the amount of supplement in payment in this case is based on the board's maximum rent level for a single person in shared accommodation of €93 per week. Taking account of the prescribed €12 minimum contribution mentioned above the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in this case is €81 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2253">The health board has provided assistance in respect of rent arrears for the person's previous accommodation and a rent deposit to secure the person's current accommodation. Should the person wish to move to single tenant accommodation she will be required to secure accommodation within the appropriate level set by the board of €107 per week.</p>

          <p eId="para_2255">There are no precise legal definitions of the terms "disadvantage", "disadvantaged area" and "disadvantaged community" in the codes of legislation for which my Department has responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_2256">My Department, through the office for social inclusion, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy, "Building an Inclusive Society", which was launched in February 2002. The strategy does not define the terms to which the Deputy refers, but is underpinned by the following definition of poverty:</p>
          <p eId="para_2257">People are living in poverty if their income and resources, material, cultural and social, are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. As a result of inadequate income and resources people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_2258">This definition recognises the multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of poverty and exclusion and provides a framework to address issues of disadvantage across a range of policy domains. In this regard, the strategy makes specific reference to those experiencing urban and rural disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_2259">In relation to the former group, the strategy sets an overall objective of tackling social exclusion in urban areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner by ensuring the provision of adequate income and by building viable and sustainable communities, through improving the lives of people living in disadvantaged urban areas and building social capital and community ownership of strategies. The strategy states that there will be a particular focus on reducing the harm caused through drug misuse and the incidence of crime; improving family support services; increasing youth participation in education and training; and ensuring that State services are delivered in an integrated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_2260">On rural disadvantage, the overall objective set out in the strategy is to tackle social exclusion in rural areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner by ensuring the provision of an adequate income, through employment and income support, access to adequate services and infrastructure on a timely basis, and co-ordination of responses and empowerment of local people and communities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_337">The multi-dimensional nature of poverty, exclusion and disadvantage is reflected in the wide range of measures being implemented by the relevant Departments and agencies in seeking to meet these objectives and in the variety of indicators employed to measure progress towards the achievement of the objectives.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2262">The old age pension and widow/er's pension, are social assistance schemes which provide financial support for older people and widows-widowers who do not qualify for contributory schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes, these schemes feature a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2263">The following items are counted as means in the assessment for old age pension and widow/er's pension: cash income, including occupational pensions or pensions from a foreign country; income from employment or self-employment; the yearly value of any property owned; and the yearly value of any savings and investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2264">The main items which do not count as means include the family home; the yearly value of the first €12,697,38 of capital for a single person and €25,394.76 for a married-cohabiting couple; any payment made by Department of Social and Family Affairs; foster child allowance; and income from a charitable organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2265">In the case of old age pension, the total means of a couple are halved in order to determine the means of one of that couple. The means testing arrangements for both of the relevant schemes are the same regardless of whether a person is under or over 80 years of age. However, a weekly allowance of €6.40 is automatically awarded to all recipients of social assistance schemes at the age of 80. Other allowances such as the living alone allowance, fuel allowance and household benefits package may also be available.</p>

          <p eId="para_2274">The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to help the unemployed and other groups to improve their qualifications and to enhance their employment prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_2275">A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In light of this, and in view of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised.</p>
          <p eId="para_2276">In framing proposals to change elements of the BTEA scheme my concern was to ensure that resources should be focused where the need is greatest. In line with this, payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued for BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment as many students traditionally find seasonal work at home or abroad during the summer months. Participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions. All other participants on the scheme – lone parents and people with disabilities – remain unaffected by this decision and will retain payment during the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2277">The BTEA scheme was revised in respect of people who wish to pursue certain full-time postgraduate courses, these now no longer qualify for BTEA purposes. All of the people concerned are already in possession of a third level qualification and I am satisfied that they have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint, I want to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching will not be affected by these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2278">I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market and I have no plans to alter these arrangements.</p>
