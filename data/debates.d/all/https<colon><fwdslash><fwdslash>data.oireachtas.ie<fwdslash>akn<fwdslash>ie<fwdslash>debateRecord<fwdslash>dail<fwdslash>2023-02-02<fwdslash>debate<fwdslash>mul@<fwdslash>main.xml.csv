I congratulate him on his new appointment. It is also our first question time since the tragic murder of Private Seán Rooney on 14 December so I will take this opportunity to offer my condolences to his friends, family and comrades and to wish Trooper Shane Kearney a speedy recovery from his serious injuries. Will the Tánaiste give us on update on the work that has been going on over recent years with regard to full implementation of the working time directive for members of the Defence Forces?

I visited his comrades in Lebanon last week. We can talk about that later. As the Deputy is aware, the Defence Forces are currently excluded from the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which transposed the European working time directive into Irish law. However, the Government has committed to amending this Act and bringing both the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána within the scope of its provisions, where appropriate in light of the nature of some of their duties. The responsibility for preparing the legislative framework required to bring the Defence Forces within the scope of the Act lies with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My officials are continuing to engage actively with that Department to progress these changes.  A significant amount of work undertaken by military management has determined that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance with the working time directive.  However, it has also been determined that there are some activities which may be outside the scope of the directive due to their very specific nature.  A robust time and attendance system is also an essential element in ensuring that the provisions of the working time directive are properly afforded to serving members of the Defence Forces and progress on this matter is also a priority.  Extensive deliberations between Department of Defence officials and the military authorities on these matters have been informed by the interpretation of recent European case law on military service as well as by the fundamental requirement to ensure that rights are afforded to serving members while ensuring that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfil their essential State functions.  I am pleased to say that dialogue with the representative associations on a proposed management position is continuing and I am aware that a number of issues raised by the associations are actively being examined by civilian-military management.  We should allow space for this dialogue to continue. I hope we will see the outcome of that dialogue relatively quickly.

Over the last 12 months, since the publication of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, a further 500 members of the Defence Forces have left. There are very significant pressures on members of the Defence Forces. The critical need to fully implement the working time directive has been highlighted time and again. In the Government's response to the commission's report, the high-level action plan, a number of early actions to be completed within six months of the Government decision, which was taken in July of last year, are indicated. One of these, which had regard to the working time directive, read "Heads of Bill to be finalised with a view to submitting to the Attorney General’s office." It has now been seven months since the Government's decision to implement level of ambition 2 and we have yet to see the heads of any Bill. What is the position with regard to the legislation? Will the Tánaiste touch on the exemptions? What exemptions are being looked at because the directive needs to be implemented in full?

A final management position on the implementation of the directive will be submitted to me for my consideration and approval. Thereafter, our officials will work with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who will take forward the appropriate legislative framework. I have asked my officials to expedite this, to make sure the dialogue I referenced earlier can be brought to a conclusion and to get the final management position in so that we can move on this issue.

In the Government's own high-level action plan for the implementation of the commission's recommendations, the low-hanging fruit was considered to be the bringing forward of heads of a Bill with regard to the working time directive. The Tánaiste now tells me that work has not even started. The Government's legislative programme for the spring does not even mention the drafting of such legislation as a priority. There is little or no faith in the Government's willingness or ability to implement any of the recommendations of the commission's report, particularly when its own high-level action plan is not being implemented. We were told that the heads of a Bill with regard to the working time directive would be brought forward within six months with a view to submitting them to the Attorney General but work has not even commenced. Will the Tánaiste indicate how long it will take for work to commence on the heads of Bill and when we will actually see them? More importantly and with regard to conversations with the representative bodies, what kinds of exemptions are being looked at because they are adamant that the directive needs to be fully implemented?

It is important that the dialogue with the representative associations bears fruit. We could proceed with legislation oblivious to those engagements with the representative associations but, in dealing with a matter that relates to the organisation of working time in the context of the directive, it is important that we have fruitful engagement and dialogue with the representative associations. Management is also to submit a final position to me. It is important to get it right because it is complex. There is no point in pretending it is not because it is. However, I am determined to get this done.

I also associate myself with the condolences expressed to the family, friends and comrades of the late Private Seán Rooney. My question is simple. What are the Tánaiste's plans to arrest the ongoing haemorrhaging of staff from the Defence Forces, which we are aware of? In particular, what is the current status of our active seagoing fleet?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	8	The military authorities advise that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 December 2022 was 7,987. The strength in July 2022 was 8,194; 8,146 in August; 8,103 in September; 8,074 in October and 8,049 in November. We have previously acknowledged, and I do so now, that the current staffing difficulties in the Naval Service are very serious. I received a briefing yesterday from members of military management and met them on their proposed recruitment strategy for 2023. Recruitment was notably lower in 2022 than in previous years and this briefing outlined how the Defence Forces military management proposes to counter this trend. With regard to the Naval Service, it has been decided that the LÉ Róisín should be placed into operational reserve with effect from 31 January, as should the LÉ Niamh once its mid-life refit is completed later this year. This is aimed at stabilising operational delivery while assisting in regeneration by prioritising the training and development of existing Naval Service personnel. The Naval Service has advised that this action will not affect its ability to fulfil its current maritime security and defence commitments, including commitments provided under the current service level agreement with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency.  In response to the specific challenges in the Naval Service, a comprehensive Naval Service regeneration plan is being progressed and monitored by a high-level civil and military team. The aim of this plan is to address issues, including human resource matters, facing the Naval Service. This is in addition to ongoing general service and direct entry recruitment, and a tender competition for a specialist recruitment body to target individuals with the skills and expertise that are required by the Naval Service. A number of retention initiatives have been implemented and others are currently under way. These include service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the seagoing naval personnel tax credit. Agreement has also been secured to allow for an extension in service limits for privates and corporals and, on an interim arrangement, for sergeants. There has been significant progress on pay as a result of increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report, from recent pay agreements and the early implementation of some of the recommendations of Commission on the Defence Forces.

We have been talking about the haemorrhaging of staff for a very long time and we are now at a critical level. The Tánaiste would have read the remarks of Lieutenant Colonel Conor King at the annual delegate conference of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, when he said that given the lack of action on crucial retention measures, the lack of implementation, the lack of respect and consideration afforded to commissioned men and women who are to be relied upon to drive the clearly identified changes required, we now know that we have an almost Sisyphean task to get back to a strength of 9,500. The task of getting to 11,500 is almost beyond reach. Is it the Tánaiste's objective to reach 11,500 members of the Permanent Defence Force and how is it going to happen? We are going backwards now, with two additional ships mothballed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	10	Since my appointment I have reviewed the situation. The first priority is to get back to a strength of 9,500. The situation is not good right now in terms of the Naval Service in particular. The numbers are simply too low. We need a radical look at the entire organisation of the Naval Service in the context of recruitment and retention. It is simply not tenable right now in terms of the issues. We have moved on the pay front and substantial progress has been made. The starting pay for a newly qualified three-star private recruited on completion of basic training for possibly 26 weeks and the Naval Service equivalent is currently €36,419. A newly commissioned officer, that is, a school-leaver who applied for cadet training, is now commissioned after 15 to 18 months' cadet training and starts on a salary of €40,316. If officers are already graduates when they join, they start on a salary of €45,000. We can still look at other areas but I feel that it is something to do with the organisation of working time within the Naval Service itself. We have to take modern-day realities into account. We need to stand back and do everything we possibly can to arrest this decline. I do not disagree with the Deputy's basic point.

It is not having any effect. We are losing the skilled personnel that it has taken years to train. We have not got a solution to that; in fact we are going backwards. How many Naval Service vessels are actually patrolling our waters right now? Before we get to a strength of 11,500, when does the Tánaiste expect the interim target of 9,500 to be achieved?

Right now we are hovering at about 8,000. It will take some time, certainly, within the next two to three years, to get to the figure of 9,500, maybe sooner. Yesterday there was a significant briefing on the investment we are going to put into Gormanston as a centre of excellence for induction training. That should have happened before now. It is a significant investment in itself. The Naval Service currently has a fleet of six vessels. The LÉ Niamh is in the process of a mid-life refit which is expected to be completed in quarter 3 of this year.

Two inshore patrol vessels have been purchased to replace the LÉ Orla and the LÉ Ciara. Again, there are issues around trying to expand the catchment area in terms of the recruitment pool into the Naval Service. There are some thoughts on that which we discussed yesterday regarding recruiting more from different parts of the country where there would not have been a tradition of such recruitment heretofore.

The commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference. It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland. It covers high-level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding. Given the significant recommendations contained in the report, detailed consideration of these recommendations was undertaken over a period of five months by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. Following this engagement, a high-level action plan and a memorandum for Government were brought to Government in July last year. This involved the approval of a move to level of ambition 2, LOA2, as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on the Defence Forces. This will result in the defence budget rising from €1.1 billion to €1.5 billion, in 2022 prices, by 2028, the largest increase in defence funding in the history of the State. This will allow for the required substantial transformation and investment in recruitment and equipment that were identified by the commission. The budget for 2023 included an increase of €67 million over the 2022 budget for defence. This includes an almost 25% increase in capital funding and demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to support the transformation of the Defence Forces into a modern, agile military force capable of responding to increasingly complex security threats. The move to LOA2 will require an additional 2,000 personnel, civil and military, over and above the current establishment of 9,500. Work has already commenced on this with the recently announced recruitment campaign, Be More. Some specific initiatives include the immediate commencement of planning for military radar capabilities, including primary radar and the establishment of an office of Reserve affairs with the priority objective of developing a regeneration plan for the Reserve Defence Force. The high-level action plan set out initial implementation and oversight structures. An implementation oversight group has been established which met for the first time on 3 October. Subsequently, Ms Julie Sinnamon was appointed as the independent chair of the implementation oversight group with a second meeting taking place on 17 November and a third meeting taking place on 27 January. A high-level steering board has been established, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, to oversee the implementation.

When the report was published this time last year, there were 8,468 members of the Defence Forces. As of the end of January, that figure stood at 7,907. The commission report could have been used to instil some sort of confidence that the Government is taking action.Members of the Defence Forces are voting with their feet; they are leaving in their droves. Some 500 members have left in the 12 months since the publication of the commission's report. The issue with members of the Naval Service has been touched on already. This time last year, there were 867 members of the Naval Service. That figure now stands at 800, which is 294 fewer than the establishment figure. In January alone, 12 sailing days had to be cancelled because of the crisis in the Naval Service. There is no sense of urgency whatever, as I stated already, as regards the high-level action plan, with the Government's implementation targets already being missed.

No one is in any doubt about the challenges facing the Defence Forces, the loss of personnel or the fact that we are not recruiting sufficient personnel to offset the numbers who are leaving. That involves both a recruitment and a retention strategy. In the context of the high-level action group it involves implementation of the 38 early actions to be completed within six months of the Government decision. To date, approximately two thirds of those 38 early actions have been achieved. I can go through the details for the Deputy on the head of transformation and the head of strategic HR positions. The human resource management and human resource dimension of the Defence Forces have to be transformed, and there also has to be cultural transformation within the Defence Forces. We have implemented the oversight group, with Ms Julie Sinnamon approved as chair and overseeing the implementation. We have removed the requirement for three-star private able seamen to mark time for the first three years at that rank and we have ensured that all personnel at private three-star able seaman rank are paid the full-rate military service allowance applicable to the rank.

The Government responded with its analysis of the commission's recommendations seven months ago, in July of last year, and there is still a massive haemorrhaging of members of the Defence Forces. There is a lack of willingness, as far as I can see, to fully implement all of the commission's recommendations as quickly as possible. I have already highlighted the issue around the working time directive where a solution has been identified, not just by the commission but by representative bodies representing members of the Defence Forces. The Government gave a commitment to bring forward heads of Bill within six months. It was supposed to have submitted them to the Office of the Attorney General in January but has failed even to implement that solution. Of the recommendations in the commission's report, 37% were accepted by the Government, 42% were accepted in principle and 13% were to receive further evaluation, with the Government to revert in the case of 8% of them. On the analysis of the recommendations that were not accepted by the Government and those to be given further analysis, what is the position? Has that analysis been done? Is the Government fully supportive of all of the recommendations contained in the commission's report?

My task is to move forward quickly to implement the recommendations. Of the 38 early actions to be completed within six months, about two thirds have been achieved to date. That includes the head of transformation and the head of strategic HR positions being advertised externally and progressed. It also includes implementation and governance structures being developed and initiated, including the establishment of an implementation oversight group. I have gone through the specifics of the requirements for three-star private able seamen and so forth and I mention the recruitment and induction strategies. There will also be a fundamental legislative change, not just in the context of the organisation of working time directive but also a new defence Act. I have asked my officials to progress work on that legislation and to develop capacity within the Department to set about fundamentally updating and modernising defence legislation to take cognisance of the recommendations of the commission. I will be focusing strongly on that aspect.

The legislation provides that the operation must be mandated by the United Nations, approved by the Government and approved by way of a resolution of Dáil Éireann. Any modification to the triple lock requirements for peacekeeping operations overseas, where the Irish Government can deploy Defence Forces personnel, would require a change in primary legislation to remove the requirement for the operation to be mandated by the United Nations. We need to look at this and have a discussion on it because of where we are with the United Nations, in particular, with the composition of the Security Council and the behaviour of certain of its members. The significant reluctance to facilitate peacekeeping missions could impinge on the sovereignty of the Irish State in deciding whether it wants to participate in peacekeeping missions into the future. There is a real dark cloud over whether there will be future UN-mandated peacekeeping missions. I would welcome an Oireachtas debate and discussion on this, free from calling people out, name-calling or labelling. We need an informed and mature debate on this because the way things have evolved is such that Russia has a veto on whether Ireland takes part in peacekeeping in the future. We need to reflect on that. I genuinely believe that, having thought about it over the last six months when this issue has been raised. There is a cause for reflection on the part of all of us.

I assume I have a different opinion from the Tánaiste, in that I believe the triple lock has given us strength until this point and I do not want to infringe in any way on our neutrality, although we may disagree as to whether it would or not. Why not have the debate as opposed to spending the past year or more listening to the Minister's predecessor and other members of the Government saying we need to talk about Irish defence or neutrality? Let us have that conversation at this point. The Tánaiste said we would need to change primary legislation if we were to reconsider the triple lock. That cannot be imposed either on this House or the population so let us have that debate and make space for it. I encourage the Tánaiste to do that. Let us stop talking about this. The Tánaiste should give us the opportunity to have that debate.

This is a debate and maybe it is the catalyst for the commencement of a debate. We will shortly commence work on a strategic defence review and this is a serious issue that we need to consider. Peacekeeping is a noble Irish tradition. It has been a hallmark of the execution of our foreign policy and has brought great honour to the nation, involving generations of peacekeepers. There is a real possibility now that there will not be a UN peacekeeping mission for some time, particularly given how the world is evolving and how certain powers are using other militias and paramilitary groups to exert their will in certain parts of the world. We need to take stock of all of that reality and have that informed debate. I have repeatedly said this. Wearing my Department of Foreign Affairs hat, I will say that we are also looking at that discussion and at what type of forum we would develop to discuss the wider issues of the modern day threats to the security of the State and the area of clarifying and working through our position around military neutrality and so forth.

If we look at Ireland's performance on the UN Security Council for the past two years, it has been quite effective and impactful, particularly in facilitating humanitarian access to areas of significant and severe conflict like Syria and Ethiopia.Many of the authorities there did not like what Ireland was doing because we were defending those who desperately needed humanitarian access. It was a lesson to us too. It opened up some insights as to where this is all going. We need a debate on that in the House. Perhaps we could organise a discussion at committee level first. In the interests of the peacekeeping tradition, which I am talking about first and foremost, I want to see Ireland continue to play its role on the peacekeeping front primarily. That is our greatest strength. We are not a military power and we never will be a military power of any consequence, but we can contribute significantly to peace in the world and to the assistance of people who are under threat because of war and starvation.

Last year, in my role as Taoiseach, I met with both groups, Women of Honour and Men and Women of Honour, and I was very taken by the incredible courage they displayed in sharing their experiences of unacceptable behaviour in the Defence Forces. From extensive engagements with serving and former members of the Defence Forces, it has also been very clear that there is a critical and immediate need to address the prevailing work culture, including issues relating to the current systems, policies and procedures for dealing with such behaviour in the Defence Forces. The judge-led independent review group, established on 25 January last year by the Government, has been examining those very systems, policies and procedures for dealing with issues relating to bullying, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces, as well as the prevailing workplace culture. The primary objective of all concerned at the outset, therefore, has been to acknowledge issues in the current workplace and to establish a course of action that would address that. The independent review group has undertaken this work in the past 12 months, while also examining matters of a historical nature. I am aware that many stakeholders, including serving members, have lent their support to the independent review group. Both I and the former Minister for Defence have at all times been clear that we would await the assessment from this report, including with regard to historical matters. It is imperative that the current workplace culture is fully aligned with the principles of dignity, equality, mutual respect and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces. I am fully confident that this report will help us do that while also advising on historical matters. I understand the group is nearing the conclusion of the report and it will be submitted to me later this week. I will consider this report in full in consultation with the Attorney General. I assure the Deputy that I will bring the report to the Government for its consideration and subsequent publication. I have not yet seen the report and therefore do not intend to pre-empt its conclusions or recommendations, but I will revert to the House on these very important matters in due course.

It is Thursday. Is there a specific day for when this report will be provided? At the time Fianna Fáil voted against the Sinn Féin motion for a statutory independent inquiry, we were told that speed was of the essence. I put it to the Minister that the Government gave a commitment to completing this report within a year, on that basis of speed. It has broken that commitment. It is now more than a year and there is still no sign of this report. What plausible explanation for this delay can the Minister give to those who engaged in that process? When was he made aware that this delay was going to take place? Has he requested a specific date for this report to be handed over to him? By the end of the week means nothing to those who engaged in the process. More importantly, after the Minister has received the report, when will he pass it on to the Attorney General and what is the timeframe for him to receive a response?

I will receive the report. There has been no delay on my side. Once an independent review group has been appointed, we have to allow the judge to conduct the report without engagement or interference from the political side.

I intend to bring the report to the Government. I will obviously come back to the House in respect of it and will consult with various stakeholder groups, in addition to those who are clearly involved. It is a report that is of importance to every serving member of the Defence Forces and is of wide public interest to the country at large. It will be a very important report, as will its recommendations and our work on them. As I said, I have not seen the report yet.

The failure to publish this report in the timeframe that was given by the Government is a very poor reflection. When the Minister was in Lebanon he was quoted as saying it was his intention to make sure that the recommendations contained in the report are fulfilled. Does that include taking actions in addition to the recommendations already included in the high-level action plan for the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, such as amending the complaints procedure to introduce a mechanism away from military command and into the hands of An Garda Síochána? I am sure the Minister is familiar with Christine Whitecross, the senior Canadian military officer who was tasked with probing similar complaints within their services. She outlined that complaints being investigated by senior officers meant that they were not being correctly dealt with from the very start. Does the Minister intend, if the report recommends it, to initiate a full statutory inquiry, a State apology, and an insistence that the use of any subsequent non-disclosure agreements will only be at the request of victims and not the Department or its representatives?

I have very clear views on those issues and in respect of the full set of recommendations that will come from the report itself. First, I want to get the report and bring it to my Government colleagues because they will also be involved in that decision-making. I will make recommendations to the Government on foot of the report. It will then be debated in the House.

Things moved a little quicker than expected. The number of new recruits to, and discharges from, the Defence Forces has been repeatedly mentioned in this House over the past ten to 15 years. I ask the Minister to outline what is the tipping point where he and the Department review all the efforts to date regarding retention and recruitment. Will they have an honest review that will state this is not working and we need to try something different?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	47	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13 and 22 together. We had that meeting yesterday. I met with the military command and senior officials in my Department in respect of recruitment and retention.The question before me refers specifically to attracting females to enlist in the Defence Forces and to feel fully respected. In terms of recruitment strategies generally, as I have already highlighted my immediate focus is on stabilising the staffing situation in the Naval Service, and thereafter on bringing the strength of the Naval Service and the Defence Forces generally to the numbers required to meet the agreed level of ambition arising from the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces. Within this commitment, I wish to confirm that it is Government policy to increase female participation rates at all levels across the Defence Forces. The high-level action plan agreed by the Government on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces contains a range of recommendations designed to assist in increasing female participation in the Defence Forces. A number of these recommendations have been identified as early actions, including the appointment of a senior gender adviser at colonel level, options for female participation at general staff level, a review of fitness standards, and the development of gender, diversity and unconscious bias training. These are critical recommendations which will underpin the commitment to moving to a strong representation by women across the ranks.

I thought we had moved on to No. 7 but it was not taken. In any event, as I said, yesterday we had a meeting on recruitment and retention. Particularly with regard to the Naval Service we clearly have to stand back. We have taken measures. Pay and conditions were identified as issues over the past two to three years. There has been a lot of movement on the pay front. We have more work to do for those working in the Naval Service because the numbers are critically low. We need to move very quickly on recruitment for the Naval Service and develop different strategies. The Chief of Staff and others have clear views in respect of this.

What we do not hear, and certainly what we do not see, is a corresponding intensity from the Government to be able to counter these challenges because they are very real. Earlier when responding to Deputy Howlin the Tánaiste mentioned the LÉ Niamh. What he failed to mention is that the LÉ Niamh will be placed into operational reserve on completion of a mid-life refit later this year. Two ships will remain in operational reserve until such time as the Naval Service has sufficiently regenerated suitably qualified and experienced personnel. This is included in the response to a parliamentary question I received from the Department yesterday.

Once they are delivered to Ireland a plan will be developed to achieve initial operating capability for two inshore patrol vessels coming from New Zealand. I have to put it to the Tánaiste that waiting until we are looking at another two ships being mothballed and unable to put staff on them is not a coherent plan. It is not any form of a plan. The staffing arrangements for existing vessels, and any new one, need to be something on which the Department and the Tánaiste are focused on now.

This is a fact. The Tánaiste can go and look it up if he needs to but it is a fact. We are haemorrhaging a level of skill from the Defence Forces, particularly the Naval Service which the Tánaiste mentioned, and losing a knowledge base that will take a significant period of time to replace. Nobody coming in the door to any job is able to carry out that job to the same level as somebody who has been there for ten or 15 years. This is specifically true when we look at the very specialised work that those in the Naval Service undertake. While the Tánaiste may be bringing in additional staff and focusing on getting the number back up to 9,500, he is not taking into account the impact that the loss of experienced staff has on ensuring that any training is done efficiently and speedily and that people are brought through to be fully serving members of the Defence Forces. There is a difference between being a member of the Defence Forces in training and someone carrying out the job they are due to do. I have another question on staffing levels in the Defence Forces. How many posts of an ancillary nature in the Defence Forces are unoccupied?

The plan is iterative in nature, thus ensuring it remains relevant and investment is targeted where most needed. A mid-term review of the plan was recently completed by the Department and the Defence Forces to ensure the plan continues to reflect current operational requirements. In respect of Custume Barracks, a number of projects are either ongoing or scheduled for progression in the coming year at a combined cost of €1.8 million. These are electric vehicle points enabling works, an upgrade to the main helipad, replacement of the EAS hangar and heat pump installation in the band hall and the main billet block. A number of the recommendations contained in the Commission on the Defence Forces report may impact on the structure of the Defence Forces, including that the structure of the Army be reviewed. In this context the disposition of units throughout the Defence Forces may be considered.  The recommendation that the structure of the Army be reviewed was identified as an early action in the high-level action plan. Military authorities are progressing the establishment of an office of Army force design which will undertake the work required to give effect to this recommendation. The implementation management office is working on the production of a detailed implementation plan for the remaining recommendations, which will include those that may assist with informing any decision on the future structure and organisation of the Defence Forces. Custume Barracks is, and will continue to be, a very important operational military barracks. Of this Deputies can be assured.

One of those recommendations is on the structure of the Army, which is to be reviewed, and rearranging units across the Defence Forces is now to be considered. In that context, will the Tánaiste consider designating Custume Barracks in Athlone as the location for the proposed Army headquarters, as recommended within the commission's report?

Custume Barracks is also the only headquarters that is not currently a headquarters today. It has all the infrastructure in place. I also put it to the Tánaiste that when brigade status was removed from Custume Barracks there was a clear commitment given on the maintenance of personnel numbers in the barracks that has not been achieved. Many of the personnel based in Athlone are based there in name only and are actually being deployed out of Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin. In light of that, will the Tánaiste give serious consideration to designating Custume Barracks with this particular status?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	88	Again, that was a decision taken prior to my coming into office but nonetheless it is important to point out the 2023 Revised Estimate for Defence of over €915 million includes an overall pay allocation of €546 million, which is an increase of €19 million on the Revised Estimate for 2022. This overall allocation provides, inter alia, for all costs associated with the existing Building Momentum pay deal, for the recruitment of the head of transformation and strategic HR roles in the Defence Forces and for the implementation of a range of sectoral measures that impact on Permanent Defence Force, PDF, pay and allowances, as identified and prioritised by the Commission on the Defence Forces. Some €468 million has been provided for the pay of members of the Permanent Defence Force. In previous years, as part of a long-standing arrangement, pay funding was allocated for the PDF establishment strength of 9,500, with any unused funding arising from PDF strengths falling below establishment being utilised to address spending pressures elsewhere in the Vote group, in accordance with Government financial procedures and in agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. However, as the Deputy said, a revised approach was introduced as part of the 2023 Estimates with pay funding for the year being based on prevailing strength, plus an anticipated net increase of 400 personnel, with non-pay subheads of the Defence Vote increased in recognition of the change from the previous unique arrangement. Arising from this changed approach to pay funding, plus additional resources provided as part of the budget, the overall non-pay allocation on the Defence Vote has increased by over €60 million in 2023, which is a rise of 21%, with virtually all non-pay subheads benefiting from an increased allocation. Therefore, the change has been of benefit to the Defence Vote overall. There is a guarantee there that as numbers increase, there is no issue with current provision for salaries into the future. The key issue from now on is that the level of funding allocated in budget 2023 and future budgets enables the Defence Forces to deliver effectively on their key domestic and international responsibilities and facilitates the structural, HR and cultural transformation required and recommended by the Commission on the Defence Forces.

It spoke of a lack of ambition and desire to address the chronic haemorrhaging of members of the Defence Forces. The Tánaiste might outline what the underspend on pay is in the context of the shortfall of 1,500 personnel versus the establishment figure. What is that real figure? While the Tánaiste is dressing this up as some sort of victory for the Defence Forces, the reality this speaks of is a continuation of failure, especially when retention primarily revolves around pay and issues around that. I ask the Tánaiste for a specific figure. What is the underspend on the payroll?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	90	As I said, the change is that the prevailing number dictates the allocation, so there will not be an underspend in that respect. It is a sensible approach. The key issue is that the largest budget increase ever experienced by the Department of Defence occurred in the 2023 Estimate. The pay increases have occurred relative to the pay agreements and the recommendations. There are other recommendations that will improve terms and conditions for personnel that we are working on. Critically, we need significant investment for capital investment and non-pay allocation of resources. The arrangement opens up opportunities while protecting the commitments made by the Government on both the ambition to get back to 9,500 personnel and up to 11,500, which is the LOA 2 objective. Therefore, there are sufficient guarantees on the pay front. I repeat there is no lack of urgency about changing the recruitment story within the Defence Forces.

There is a lack of urgency. I refer back to the failure of the Government to reach its own minimum targets for bringing forward the heads of a Bill on the working time directive. The Tánaiste outlined some of the positive measures that have been made on some of the allowance, but as we stand here there are many members of the Defence Forces who are still reliant on the working family payment. It is an absolute disgrace. The Tánaiste is portraying this as some sort of win-win for members of the Defence Forces but 500 of them have left since the publication of the commission's recommendations. There are still members of the Defence Forces sleeping in their cars because of an inability to afford accommodation. That is a failure of the Tánaiste and of the Government and it reflects a lack of ambition and desire to address the chronic, major crisis within the Defence Forces.

It is our obligation to facilitate a rewarding and fruitful career for people, and lives for people, within our Defence Forces and there are many factors that can give rise to that. These include opportunities within the Defence Forces for progression, education, further learning, experiences in various challenging missions overseas, promotional opportunities and a good work-life balance, which does relate to the organisation of working time directive. A balancing perspective must be applied to the narrative around people working in our Defence Forces. Significant improvements have occurred in the last two years and that must be acknowledged. More is required and more improvements will occur.There will be significant investment on an ongoing basis in our Defence Forces arising from Government decisions that were taken as a result of the Commission on the Defence Forces recommendations.

I have corresponded since my appointment with a number of EU counterparts and I look forward to engaging with them in-person, both bilaterally and in the format of the Foreign Affairs Council and in the Defence Ministers format also. There will be two opportunities to meet my colleagues in March. In early March, I will attend an informal meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm and on 20 March, EU Foreign and Defence Ministers will meet jointly to discuss the strategic compass, one year on from its adoption by EU leaders. While the agenda for the March informal has not yet been confirmed, it seems safe to assume the discussions will be dominated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the international community's response; particularly that of the European Union. One could also imagine that such issues as the utilisation of the European peace facility, the European Union Military Assistance Mission Ukraine, EUMAM, and the progress made to date on the implementation of the strategic compass will also be on the ministers' agenda. Indeed, a number of these issues featured on the agenda of EU defence policy directors in Stockholm yesterday. In terms of the Council meeting, the strategic compass, and common security and defence, Ireland has decided to join an EU battle group in which Germany will take the lead role. We have consistently been part of battle groups and training and preparing in such battle groups which improves our interoperability with other forces we serve with on peacekeeping missions. I think that makes sense. We also have to reflect continually on the evolution of the European Union's common security and defence policy. Given the particular interests and concerns that we have, it is important we participate in those discussions in order that Ireland's position is well understood. Bilateral engagement is a key element in ensuring this is the case.

Does this not erode Ireland's neutrality which has been a policy for decades? It has given huge credence to Ireland's international standing not to take part in any military exercise that is seen as, not defensive, but offensive. I read by this that any participation by Ireland in these groups in a breach of neutrality.

We are not members of a military alliance. We are not members of NATO. That is the definition of Ireland's military neutrality. We have never been politically neutral. We have joined the European Union and have been a member since 1973. We have been involved in battle groups since 2001 onwards. Participating in battle groups in themselves does not commit to any particular theatre of either peacekeeping, peace enforcement or any such thing. All such decisions would have to come back to this House, back to the Government and be UN mandated in terms of peacekeeping and Security Council resolutions. In no way does participation in a battle group undermine Ireland's military neutrality. When I was in Lebanon, we worked with the Polish troops, for example, and with some Hungarian troops. It makes absolute sense that there is interoperability on such missions otherwise it would be far more dangerous.

This is a flagrant breach of Ireland's neutrality. If you look at Ireland's participation even in the Nordic battle groups, the evolution can be seen and how Ireland is being pulled into more of a European defence army. Even on the commentary in the House in relation to eroding Ireland's triple lock status, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has said in the past that this is open for interpretation and debate. The soundings thus far, particularly in the last year, suggest Ireland's neutrality is being eroded. It is being eroded by stealth and by actual participation in these groups. These groups are not defensive; they are offensive. Looking at Ireland's participation in these groups, they are offensive, not defensive.

They are essentially a training preparation exercise. Our Army cannot be isolationist and not ever meet or engage with any other army or defence forces. That is an absurd position to adopt. Taking cybersecurity as an example, which is a huge threat to the country. Are we to be isolationist in terms of the threat of cybersecurity in this country? Are we to ignore the expertise around the world in respect of cybersecurity and in terms of hybrid threats that are increasingly a part of war? We need to have our own independent position as we go into engagement with others, certainly, and we need to have our bottom edge. Again, we discussed this earlier when Deputy Gannon raised the issue of the triple lock. The issue now for the forceable future is that Russia will determine whether Ireland ever again participates in a peacekeeping mission. We need to reflect on that. I would argue that this is a curtailment of our own sovereignty if we want to participate in a UN peacekeeping mission in the future. There may not be UN peacekeeping missions in the future because of that very fact and given the way Russia, and to a lessor extent, China, are currently behaving on the Security Council. We need to discuss these things openly.

The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government, and its report was published on 9 February 2022. The commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference. It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland and covers high-level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding. Given the significant recommendations contained in the report, detailed consideration of these recommendations was undertaken over a period of five months by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. Following this engagement, a high-level action plan and a memorandum for Government were brought to Government and approved on 12 July 2022. This involved the approval of a move to Level of Ambition 2, LOA2, as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on the Defence Forces. This will result in the Defence budget rising from €1.1 billion to €1.5 billion, in 2022 prices, by 2028, which is the largest increase in Defence funding in the history of the State. This will allow for the required substantial transformation and investment in recruitment and equipment that were identified by the commission. The budget for 2023 included an increase of €67 million over the 2022 budget. That includes an almost 25% increase in capital funding and demonstrates our commitment to supporting the transformation of the Defence Forces. The move to LOA2 will require an additional 2,000 personnel over and above the current establishment of 9,500. Work has already commenced on this with the recently announced Be More recruitment campaign. The high-level action plan set out initial implementation and oversight structures. An implementation oversight group has been established which met for the first time on 3 October. Subsequently, Julie Sinnamon was appointed as the independent chair of the implementation oversight group with a second meeting taking place on 17 November and a third meeting taking place on 27 January. A high-level steering board has been established, to which end the Department of the Taoiseach will oversee the implementation. A civil-military implementation management office, IMO, has been established to support the implementation of the overall transformation programme required to implement the recommendations. The initial focus is on the implementation of the 38 early actions as set out in the high-level action plan and as I detailed earlier, to date approximately two thirds of these 38 actions have been achieved.I think I have already dealt with some of them.

As I said, to date, approximately two thirds of these 38 early actions have been achieved. For example, the head of transformation and the head of strategic HR positions have been advertised externally and progressed. Implementation and governance structures have been developed and initiated, including the establishment of an implementation oversight group with Ms Julie Sinnamon appointed as an independent chair. The requirement for a three-star private able seaman to mark time for the first three years at that rank has been removed. We have ensured that all personnel of private three-star able seaman rank are paid the full rate of MSA applicable to the rank. Recruitment and induction have been developed, encompassing advertising, expanded recruitment and induction capacity. Progress has been made on the remaining early actions, with most currently at an advanced stage and due to be completed shortly. These actions include the establishment of an office of reserve affairs, the commencement of Army force design planning, and the establishment of a capability development planning process and permanent structure. I intend to publish a comprehensive written update on all 38 early actions in the coming weeks. One of the key early actions is the development of a detailed implementation plan, which is also at an advanced stage. This detailed implementation plan will clearly set out the work that is to be progressed in implementing the commission recommendations in full. It is a priority for me that this plan is both ambitious and credible and supports the transformation of the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland. My focus is on ensuring we get this plan right to support the transformation of the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland.

This is important. It was due to be published in January, as I understand it. Is there a plan for when this will be published or do we know how near it is to being published? Regarding engagement and involvement with the different representative organisations concerning advancing this endeavour, has the Tánaiste met with them? Turning to the exemptions under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, how these would be implemented for the Defence Forces is important. Is this going to happen? Is it going to apply to people? Is this part of the plan? I ask the Tánaiste to outline the situation with these matters.

She has been an exceptional public servant and I have no doubt that she will do a very good job again on behalf of the State and all its citizens. I wish to talk about structures in the Army, with particular reference to accommodation. Unfortunately, 11 years ago the most modern army barracks in Europe, Dún Uí Néill in Cavan, was closed. It is a location centrally situated in the Border region. We have no Army facility now between Finner Barracks in south Donegal and Aiken Barracks in Dundalk. We all know the geopolitical situation has changed in Europe, with Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and Britain's exit from the EU. An issue that needs to be considered is the number of facilities we have for our Army personnel and their location. We all want to see 10,500 people enlisted in the Permanent Defence Forces. If we do this, then we need additional accommodation. I sincerely hope that the reopening of Dún Uí Néill barracks can be given urgent, detailed and favourable consideration.

For all of us, the issue is urgency. It is lovely to set up structures, and every report we have had has referred to new structures almost in management-speak, but there has been little by way of delivery. The objective of the commission was to modernise our Defence Forces, stop the haemorrhaging of personnel and ensure the objectives set out were achieved. Regarding reporting to this House, can the Tánaiste set out his timeline for what he expects to happen during the course of this year and how it is going to be communicated to this House? This would ensure that instead of having the same type of response on every occasion we raise this matter during parliamentary questions, we could have up-to-date reporting of achievements, as opposed to structural things that are happening. I refer to actual things in terms of recruitment, training, retention, specific equipment and so on.

We can talk about this for as long as we like and we have talked about this for a very long time. The issues are apparent to everybody. They are apparent to the Defence Forces. These are acute issues and they need to be addressed in a much shorter time. The debate has taken place and I agree entirely with the points made by the Tánaiste and the other speakers. This all depends, however, on how quickly we can implement these actions and how quickly we can put them into operation. We must nail this down once and for all. Otherwise, we will be in an area of speculating as to what might happen in future and when it should happen or if it should ever happen. We must remember that there are possibly people in some places who hope this process will never happen, and as a result it does not happen. In line with Deputy Howlin and the other speakers, therefore, I appeal to the Tánaiste to put this process in motion quickly and to take control of this endeavour himself.

I am in office for just over a month, and I am determined to get beyond the management-speak and to get stuff implemented. I have reflected on the presentations I have received so far. Some progress has been made in some areas, but not fast enough in others. We have discussed the Organisation of Working Time directive. This is not simple. From my previous experience in different Departments, even when that came in originally, it was a very complex piece of work and there was much resistance in different organisations to the concept. Deputy Howlin will recall that in earlier times, and Deputy Aindrias Moynihan has raised this specific point, people felt the world was going to collapse in various professions, not least the health service.

The commission believes it is important in that it would improve retention, well-being and productivity in the Defence Forces. There are derogations in this regard, but these should only be there in exceptional or extraordinary situations. There is concern that many of these exemptions would be too wide-ranging. It is important therefore that any derogations, if they are needed, would be intended for narrow and exceptional situations so that we do not end up with the ridiculous situation like the one we have in the prison in Portlaoise. Prison officers there qualify under the provisions of the Act but Defence Forces' personnel do not. I ask that any exemptions that would be there would be exceptional and extraordinary, as advised by the commission.

As he is aware, Cavan had a proud Army tradition over the years. Generations of families joined and were proud to serve our country at home and abroad. I am sure Deputy Berry and others in the House would agree with me that there was always greater recruitment in areas where there were substantial Army barracks, such as in Cavan, Kildare and other noteworthy places. Again, therefore, I appeal for the needs of the Border region to be considered in the context of the possibility of having Dún Uí Néill barracks reopened. In Lebanon recently, the Minister met members of the Defence Forces from my county of Cavan and they spoke to him about their family connections. He knew some of those families as well. I do not think, therefore, that we should ever underestimate the continuity in family tradition and recruitment in areas where there has been a substantial Army presence over the years.

Something in the order of €60 million in non-pay additional funding seems to be very little in terms of the equipment requirements laid out, if we are going to do anything. The cost of the replacement of the two maritime aircraft would gobble up that amount. Would consideration be given to going down the road of setting a capital sum aside, as Germany has done?There was a €5 billion surplus last year. A once-off capital sum could be put aside for infrastructure and equipment needs. We are talking about recruiting personnel, which is important, but we have to give them the best infrastructure and equipment to do their job.

The Minister is in the best position to identify those, drive them forward and achieve results in the short term. Morale is affected throughout the Defence Forces due to the length of time we have discussed these issues without any marked degree of success, although that is not his fault. The salient issues can be dealt with shortly and quickly. I echo the words of my colleague in that regard, particularly in relation to traditional military constituencies.

I hate to remind him that he has been Taoiseach over the past two years. That speaks to the lack of urgency and seriousness the Government has given the major crisis within the Defence Forces. The Minister's comments hit the nail on the head. He said that of the 38 early actions, two thirds have been implemented, as if that is some sort of major achievement. The reality is that one third have not been implemented within the Government's own timeframe. These were supposed to be implemented within the first six months of the Government giving its response, which it did in July. It has missed its own targets. We do not need an implementation body. The implementation of these early actions that the Government identified is in its hands, not those of an implementation body. When are the remaining one third of the early actions the Government identified going to be fully implemented?

Soldiers, men and women, are very much willing to rough it and tough it but they want to come home to a home environment as well. Accommodation is something that needs to be addressed. In Meelick, County Clare, which is my home village, a housing scheme was built in the 1980s in partnership with Father Harry Bohan. It was affordable housing for its time. To this day, more than half of the families in Elton Court, which is a fabulous housing estate, are current or former members of the Defence Forces. Such a scheme would be fantastic if we could do it again. Maybe the Minister could partner with his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to give these people a roof over their heads where families can be reared in the community close to the barracks.

I am very much taken by Deputy Smith's point. When talking to military personnel, including those in the Naval Service, Air Corps or Army, there is a strong link back to geography and where barracks were present. Of that there is no doubt. The focus of capital investment at the moment is on upgrading existing facilities but I will talk to the Deputy further in respect of the issue he has raised. The issues raised by Deputy Moynihan have to be sorted in the context of the working time directive in locations such as Portlaoise. Historically, a dependence built up on the Army in such places, which in itself must be looked at and reflected on with regard to the appropriateness of some of the duties that are still asked of the military on the civil side in the modern day. That is a matter of ongoing review. On Deputy Howlin's point, there has been a commitment within government, in terms of the commission and the implementation of the plan, to a progressive increase in capital.

To take a radar facility for example, or any building that is planned, it is in the latter stages of the completion that the drawdown happens in respect of capital expenditure, so there can be a progressive increase in capital expenditure over the lifetime of the plan. Deputy Brady and I will have to agree to disagree. We have implemented a lot and a lot of progress has been made. Significant additional resources have been allocated to this. I take Deputy Crowe's point about accommodation. In Gormanstown, for example, there will be accommodation in the training facility. There has been some significant investment in Haulbowline in respect of accommodation. I understand the point the Deputy is making and there is merit in it.

I understand it is now in a pretty poor state of repair and that officials in the Department have recommended that it be replaced. I would like an update on where that situation is at.

The ministerial air transport service, MATS, is delivered primarily by use of the Learjet 45 aircraft, which came into operation in 2004. Where it is unavailable, the CASA and-or other Air Corps aircraft may be used. The Learjet is currently approaching its natural end of life. Based on current serviceability issues, discontinuation of manufacturer support and limited part availability for this type of older aircraft, the Air Corps estimates that the aircraft will require replacement by 2024 at the latest. As such, in line with the public spending code, an interdepartmental high-level group of officials, the MATS review group, chaired by my Department, was established in 2021 to examine options for delivery of the ministerial air transport service. The capability of this service to carry out a broader utility role for the State, in terms of tasks and reach beyond Europe, was also examined. In situations like what happened in Afghanistan last year, there is a need for the State to have strategic reach. During 2022, the MATS review group produced both an agreed strategic assessment report and a preliminary business case, the latter of which contained a detailed financial appraisal and economic assessment conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. These reports were supplemented by the inclusion of additional market research on suitable options for the acquisition of a second-hand aircraft, with the assistance of an independent aviation consultant. I have reviewed the various strands of work conducted to date and have approved the recommendation made by my officials. Ultimately, the State needs a replacement aircraft that provides a broad utility role, including strategic reach in crisis situations and medical evacuation, as well as ministerial air transport. My officials will now move to progress to procurement phase. A project team is currently being established and planning for a procurement competition for replacement capability will commence shortly. The procurement will consider both new and second-hand replacement capability. The outcome of any procurement competition will be subject to further deliberation and consideration in line with the public spending code.

All nine passengers on board, including Mexico's interior minister, were killed, as well as seven people on the ground, which was 16 people killed in total. It is very important that technology is kept up to date and kept safe. Many years ago I used to pilot planes myself. Pilots do not like taking to a plane that is unsafe or may not be fully up to spec in its equipment or maintenance. It is important not just for government purposes, although that is what everyone will hone in on here, but for humanitarian missions and medical evacuations. I know people in my constituency who have been taken to life-saving surgeries in other countries. This is so important for our country. We cannot expect members of the Government to be going around in rickshaws and we cannot just magic children who are overseas or Irish people who need to be repatriated home. We need a way of getting them home safely and I think this is a sensible decision.

The Deputy referred to the Mexican Government crash. That was a shocking crash and a shocking loss of life. There have been issues with the Learjet. There is no point in saying otherwise. There have been serious issues with it. I am not prepared to stand over it. A replacement jet is required. In Afghanistan, we essentially had to depend on other governments to get places on planes for Irish citizens we needed to evacuate quickly. That strategic reach is important. As the Deputy said, medical transport and evacuation is also important, plus the numerous duties and ministerial obligations, for European meetings in particular, are such that we need to deal with this once and for all.

It is a sensible decision and I am glad the Government is moving on it. I will ask one question in my final few seconds. Now that we are in the decade of centenaries and the Civil War is being commemorated, I am seeing photographs pop up every weekend. There was one of Youghal, County Cork the other day where Sinn Féin Deputies were walking down the street with people in paramilitary uniforms.Does the Minister think it is right that a member of the Opposition, who purports to be the shadow Minister for Defence, should march and walk in step with people who do not wear the uniform of our Defence Forces but who wear black berets and sunglasses walking our streets? Is that not wrong? Is it not insulting to the men and women who protect our country, who don that uniform, some of whom have even lost their lives defending Ireland? There is only one Army in Ireland. I ask that during his tenure, the Minister might consider imposing an outright ban on the wearing of paramilitary uniforms at such events. It totally rewrites and distorts what is a proud and sometimes divisive history in our land, but it is wrong. We must call it out as well. If Deputy Brady is Opposition spokesperson on defence, he cannot talk for one Army yet stand and march down the street with another.

I do believe it was time to commence the process because an inordinate time was taken to consider it. My view is that we should move ahead on that front. Future governments and the people, in terms of our capacity, will benefit. I have always been of the view that there is only one Óglaigh na hÉireann and that is the Irish Defence Forces. Everybody should honour that and accept that reality. We should be very clear about the avoidance of any alternative military paraphernalia, parades and the like. There can be occasions when people are re-enacting historic moments, for example schools or commemorative ceremonies, but that is different to what Deputy Crowe references. There is only one Óglaigh na hÉireann.

That said, I have already heard from four or five families in my constituency, and I was just speaking to Deputy Clarke about Athlone and various parts of the country where children do not have a place for September. What is the plan for them? Has the number of children who do not have a place in a special class or special school for this coming September been identified?

The NCSE works very closely with the Department, parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential. The Deputy will be aware that in the past two to three years, the Department and the NCSE have introduced a number of strategic initiatives to plan and provide for sufficient places in special classes and special schools. I refer in particular to the Department's geographic information system, GIS, which supports a strategic and co-ordinated approach to planning and the delivery of special educational needs, SEN, provision. That includes real-time data on capacity across the school system, and it uses data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and elsewhere. There is also updated technical guidance for building projects that involve special education provision, including guidance on reconfiguration, which is something schools ask about regarding existing accommodation. Where there is capacity to extend onto existing accommodation, that is something that is looked at prior to building a new building. When I was appointed to this role, I wanted to make sure there was a commitment from the Department on future-proofing, which means that all post-primary schools with 1,000 students, for example, will have four special classes in the school and other large-scale projects and facilities will be provided in other schools on a pro rata basis. That means that in the future there will be capacity, in particular in post-primary schools, and we do not have the issue to which the Deputy referred in his contribution whereby we are scrambling to get places at the last minute. We are trying to prevent and mitigate against that.

It was fairly broad brush strokes. I have acknowledged and welcomed some of it in the past. The question is specifically about the number of places. As things stand, the NCSE should know how many places are available in special schools and special classes. It should also know how many children require those places. Anecdotally, on the ground, it seems that this year again there are more children than there are places. Could the Minister of State confirm that? Is she taking steps to address that for this September? In time, we should be in a situation where we could plan two years ahead. I know children and families in my area, and in Dublin and Athlone, who, as things stand, do not have a place. If there is going to be a section 37A or emergency schools opened, we need to be talking about this now not in May or June. How many extra places are needed and what is the Minister of State going to do about it or is it the NCSE's view that no additional places are needed?

I will give him specific statistics if he wishes, but I want to outline to the House what we are doing in terms of forward planning, which is a critical component of making sure that we have the appropriate placements in situ. Fee-charging schools is another area that we are looking at. As the Deputy will be aware, even Bandon Grammar School in Cork, which is a fee-charging school, is now opening a special class. We are looking to have that as a blueprint, along with the Spiritans, in other schools throughout the country. Modular accommodation is going in and there is the expansion of existing planning exemptions, which is critical as well. In addition, there are issues concerning project management.

Given that such information was sought in the question, I would welcome some numbers in her final response. I am aware of one particular child who is in a special junior school, who has applied to five or six different schools. The child does not have a place for September. I know other families whose children are in unsuitable places, who have home tuition and other such arrangements. I am aware that this is an issue in other areas. Given that Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan and other Deputies have similar questions tabled, as things stand, although last year was not as bad as the previous year, it does seem that this year again in Cork we may have an issue. The Minister of State has outlined the forecasting model and the GIS. The Department should be in a position to tell us how many places we have, how many we are missing and what we must do to fill the gap. How many places have we got? Is there a gap? What is the gap? That is the conversation we must have now so that we do not have it in May and June of this year.

These are the new initiatives that we have undertaken. These initiatives are bearing fruit. We will have 600 new special classes sanctioned at primary level and almost 300 new special classes at post-primary level. We have had five new special schools over the past three years. We can see clearly that it has had a major effect on what we are trying to achieve, especially in Cork.We have 65 new special classes in Cork; 23 in Limerick; 24 in Meath; and 94 in Dublin. However, there is a focus on urban areas where demand is highest. It is a given that is important. The NCSE website, ncse.ie, has a list of all schools that have special classes with the types and locations of these classes. That can be clearly seen. We have 2,544 special classes, which is an increase from 548 in 2011. The NCSE is collaborating with schools. We have written to all post-primary schools to ask them to open special classes. Once the child is known to the council, there should be no reason to fail to have an appropriate placement for that child.

In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including more than 18,000 children and young people with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year for more than 3,800 children and young people who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme has been commenced. The review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme with regard to its broader effectiveness and sustainability and to ensuring that it serves students and their families. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, equally as important, for those who do not use the service but wish to have access to it. A broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were consulted as part of the review. Phase 1 of the review is complete. It examined the impact of eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but were attending their next nearest school. Following consideration of this report for the 2021-22 school year, the provision of temporary alleviation measures was approved for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have been continued for the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. They mean transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school; applied for school transport by 29 April 2022 and registered for a ticket by 29 July 2022. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3, which has commenced. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine, and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022 due to the waiving of fees, my officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks with recommendations on the future operation of the scheme. Once approved by Government, it is planned that the review will be published. Planning for the operation of the scheme for the 2023-24 year is expected to be completed shortly-----

The review has been going on since 2021. I know a considerable body of work has to be done, but what I am hearing from the bus operators, Bus Éireann and everybody else is that they need to have a plan in place for next September as to what is being done. They need it in February, rather than it remaining to be decided in March, April or another time. Mayhem occurred last year because the announcements were made late on what would be done and with regard to more free transport. There is nothing wrong with free transport, except that it has to be planned properly. The school transport system serves a considerable cohort of people in both mainstream and special needs school. It is important that it should run as smoothly as possible.

A phenomenal body of work has been completed. Phase 2 is also complete and phase 3 has begun. It is our expectation that it will be completed in the coming weeks. The Deputy will be aware that we introduced a temporary alleviation measure as part of the process. We did so not just for 2021 and 2022, but continued it into 2022 and 2023.

Children who were getting concessionary tickets and cannot get on these buses, because they are not getting a concessionary ticket now. This was partly due to the fact they applied on time but were refunded their money and had to do something again by July. They had to press some button or something. The system has been unforgiving. Many parents thought that because they had applied to the scheme, that was it. There was some other anomaly or glitch in the system. It means that for families in my constituency and throughout the country, parents have had to make alternative work arrangements to get their children to school. They feel discommoded by the fact they had discretionary tickets that they were prepared to pay for and were entitled to. While money was made available last October for those passengers, the scheme has not been fulfilled for everybody because the buses are not there. We then have the situation where there are buses with vacant seats on them going to schools and parents are driving after the buses in cars with their children.

As a consequence of what was introduced last year, we have seen a 25% increase in provision of places for students on the school bus system, that is, 25,600 places and there has been a 26% increase in the allocation of special education places. There has been a considerable increase in availability of places in the school transport system. I take the Deputy's point about tickets being allocated, but they were allocated to people who fulfilled the criteria. He will be aware that the criteria are based on whether the students at primary level were 3.2 km from their school or students at post-primary level were 4.8 km from their nearest or next-nearest school. Distance from the schools and paying on time were the criteria. Seats are empty for a variety of reasons. Schools may open or close at different times. Thus, there will be additional capacity at a given time. Parents, on a given day, might make themselves available to take a child to school. I cannot interfere with that process. I appreciate what the Deputy said about the application process and its being difficult. That is all part of the review process. It is our expectation the review process will be completed in the coming weeks.

It has been in place in the North for approximately 70 years. I certainly welcomed the announcement in the budget that it was to be considered for this September. Schools are beginning to wonder how they get themselves organised. I received a written answer from the Minister recently that put a small bit more meat on the bone of what she had outlined previously. However, schools are still very unsure how this will happen, not to mind bookshops and publishers. Will she shine a bit more light on how this will work? That would be great.

Its goal is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all pupils are supported to fulfil their potential. Since June 2020, and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to support measures aimed at achieving and sustaining that goal. As part of budget 2023, I announced a €50 million provision to provide free books to primary school pupils within the free education scheme from next September. This is a significant investment and further reflects the Government’s commitment to a quality and inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for every pupil. The Government recognises that the cost of preparing children for school each September can be a cause of financial difficulty and worry for many Irish families. This free schoolbooks measure will eliminate the cost to these families for all school books at primary school, including workbooks. It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to extend the free school book pilot which is currently in place in a number of DEIS primary schools. The free primary school books scheme will benefit up to 540,000 pupils in approximately 3,240 recognised primary schools, including over 130 special schools. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing school book rental scheme which is available in some 96% of recognised primary schools and has been in place for many years. Schools buy books directly from school book suppliers at present as part of the implementation of the existing school book rental scheme. My Department will also consider the information and experience from the schools involved in the free school book pilot for the past three years.  My Department has been engaging with relevant stakeholders including teacher unions, management bodies and representatives of school book publishers and booksellers in order to inform and plan for the roll out of the measure. Engagement has already commenced and I will meet with all stakeholders imminently.  Detailed guidance for primary schools on the operation of free schoolbooks measure is being developed and, together with the funding, will be provided to schools to support the purchase of the books and resources in time for the start of the 2023-24 school year. It is recognised that this work will have to commence in schools after the Easter break.

That is relatively late in the school year for some primary schools. I agree with a lot of what she said. She certainly will not find me saying that this is a bad idea. We have been talking about it for long enough and it is a good idea. It will reduce the burden on parents and level the playing field to a certain extent. A lot more needs to be done to reduce the costs for parents in respect of voluntary contributions and so on, but free school books is a good idea and I would love to see it extended to secondary schools.  The last time we discussed this, we were back and forth about the education partners and I am glad that the Minister is now engaging with publishers and booksellers, which is important. In the response I received to a written question, it seems that this programme will build on the book rental scheme and is currently planned on the basis that funds will be provided directly to schools to purchase schoolbooks and related classroom resources. That is the way it will be rolled out. Schools are going to get cash and are going to buy the books from their local bookshop. Schools are asking me when they are going to get the payment schedule. In a primary school with 700 children, for example, there is a fair bit of administration involved.

He is correct and I am conscious that the information needs to be in schools soon so that they have the opportunity to do what needs to be done in terms of the scheme. I recognise that schools will need to have this have this information available to them after the Easter break and we are working towards that schedule. As I have outlined to the Deputy, it is important that proper consultation takes place. We have had consultation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the Irish Educational Publishers Association and Booksellers Ireland. The Deputy also referenced post-primary schools. Initially, this is a primary-led initiative and there will be great learning from it. It is my hope and expectation that we will have an opportunity, going forward, to extend it to the post-primary sector. I also want to acknowledge that the package provided to schools will be based on the learnings that we had from the book rental scheme and the free book pilot scheme that we ran across 102 DEIS primary schools. This provides a significant learning opportunity, combined with what we will learn from the publishers.

Hopefully, we can get a payment schedule for schools as soon as possible so that they can go out and buy the books. Has the Department looked at the question of e-books? They could play a role in the context of parents' concerns about the weight of schoolbags. Is that part of the discussion here and where is that likely to fall?

I am conscious that many schools have strong relationships with their local bookshop or local book provider and that autonomy will continue. The schools will make the decision as to where they will source the books. The funding that is being provided is specifically for the provision of textbooks and workbooks. Schools make their own policy around whether they use e-books or textbooks but the funding will be made available on the basis of the provision of appropriate textbooks and workbooks. Schools will continue to have autonomy to decide with whom they will do business in the provision of those books. If they have an existing relationship with a local provider, they will have the freedom to make a decision to continue that relationship with that local provider.

I am pleased to advise that the project on a greenfield site was approved for delivery by my Department for the school in question. The project provides for four mainstream classrooms and one special education needs, SEN, base under the Department's timber modular framework. The site was transferred from Solas to the Minister for Education at nil cost, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars regarding the transfer and disposal of State assets. The project has been devolved for delivery to Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, LOETB. Under my Department’s service level agreement with LOETB, the ETB has responsibility for communicating progress on the project to the school authorities concerned. A design team was appointed to guide the project through the stages of architectural planning and tendering, with the ultimate goal of proceeding to construction in a timely manner.  The project will employ my Department’s timber modular framework, which is manufactured to comply with the Department’s technical guidance documents. These are available on the Department’s website. The project will achieve a low embodied carbon footprint that will meet or exceed 2030 targets contained within Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI, 2030 climate challenge target metrics for new-build schools published in October 2021. My Department's professional and technical officers are working closely with design teams on this project and others employing this innovative technology.  My Department has a strong track record of delivery of school building projects and this was achieved again in 2022, notwithstanding the wider construction sector environment of high inflation, labour shortages and supply chain issues. This is evidenced by the fact that there are currently 300 school building projects at construction stage and a further 1,000 at pre-construction stage, including the project referred to by the Deputy. The Department will continue to review its ongoing enrolment requirements for 2023 and the associated work programme.  The particular project raised by her is currently at planning application stage with a final decision to be made in late February. The Department is currently examining needs for the 2023-24 school year as part of its overall assessment of our work programme.

However, this has been frustrating for all involved in the school community, including teachers, students and parents. The school opened its doors in 2015 and while the Minister has outlined the progress that has been made, which I welcome, we owe it to the school to make sure that there is constant monitoring of progress and a timeframe is put in place for each step that will follow after the planning process has concluded. That is only fair and right because the school needs to be able to plan ahead for increased demand.At this point, however, a timeframe outlining the steps and providing a sense of when we are going to reach the end line needs to be given to the school. The only way to do that is to provide a timeframe and a schedule. I acknowledge that the Department has engaged with An Foras Pátrúnachta but there is a need for constant engagement and communication. Everyone needs to be kept up to speed.

The project was devolved to the ETB, which is charged with responsibility for informing the patrons of the progress of the project as it is ongoing. I acknowledge the importance of the project and I accept that the school awaits it in anticipation but there is a clear line of progress that needs to be followed, particularly in the area of planning. I acknowledge the work of the ETB in this regard, given that the project has devolved to it. We will move the project with the priority that can be afforded to it, giving consideration to the various hurdles it has to jump. I acknowledge the Deputy's personal interest in this, along with Deputies Fleming, Cowen and Flanagan and everybody else who has come to me in respect of it. The ETB will progress this as it is devolved to it. We would like to see it happening as quickly as possible.

As she stated, conveyancing is at an advanced stage and that is certainly welcome. I have been raising this issue on the floor of the House not just last year or the year before that but for many years and I am committed to seeing it over the line. However, an information vacuum still exists at times in respect of timeframes and how things will move after the planning stage has concluded. An Foras Pátrúnachta, the ETB and the school community should be told when they can expect the school to be built and open. The lease is running out on the current accommodation and, seven years after opening its doors, the school is still in limbo.

It is positive that the decision in respect of planning is to be made at the end of the month. That will be a landmark moment in the development of the project going forward. It will be expedited as quickly as possible. I acknowledge the Deputy's personal commitment to the project, along with Deputies Cowen and Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. It would be remiss of me not to include the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in that regard. I know the public representatives, along with the school and wider community, are significantly invested in this. It will be a landmark when planning is received in late February.

Has the Department completed its review relating to the 63 schools that piloted filling out the education component of the assessment of need, AON?

The AON process is provided for under the Disability Act and is under the remit of the HSE. The Deputy will be aware that there was a court decision and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is now required to assist the HSE purely in respect of the educational assessment of the needs of children who have applied to the HSE for an AON. In complying with this requirement, the NCSE will work with schools, which already hold extensive information arising from teachers' everyday practice in assessing their students and differentiating the curriculum to meet their educational needs. As the Deputy is aware, such information is currently collated and held by schools on the student support plan. Specifically on the Deputy's question, the Department and the NCSE have worked intensively to ensure the process put in place to support the educational component of the AON fulfils legal obligations and is rooted in existing assessment practices in schools. A trial commenced last June involved 63 schools, as the Deputy stated. That trial period was extended to encompass 80 schools. My officials and I are very grateful to all those who participated, particularly the 80 schools that assisted in the process and provided detailed feedback on the guidance documents and the process. That feedback was incorporated into the guidance documents and the form itself.  The Deputy may be aware that the revised documents and the report of education needs form issued to schools yesterday, 1 February. When schools receive requests from the NCSE to complete that form, it is intended that they can use the revised forms and support documents. I recognise it is a new process for schools and we are anxious to support them through the NCSE and our officials.

She stated that, since yesterday, the NCSE will write to any school that needs an education assessment on the AON. In October, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, AsIAm and other organisations such as Inclusion Ireland expressed concern about this process. AsIAm stated the Department of Education and its agencies require education assessments for various supports, including access to reasonable accommodation and exams. The Department has clearly defined in practice that an educational assessment is a process led by educational psychologists, not a principal compiling data already at his or her disposal. The INTO had significant concerns, including in respect of workload, lack of training, pressure on teachers and principals and the potential impact. Has the Minister of State held discussions with the INTO and AsIAm in respect of the process?

In fact, it welcomed assurances from the Department in respect of the new process yesterday. It issued a press statement stating that it is important "the new process for reporting of education needs will not be used as a replacement for assessments undertaken by educational psychologists and other health professionals". Obviously, there is concern relating to the general waiting times in terms of services and all that. The INTO stated it will be monitoring everything through monthly meetings and engaging with the Department and the NCSE until there is a review. That is an important point from the perspective of the Deputy. The Department is committed to monitoring the impact of the process but there will be a review at the end of the school year, in June, to see how everything has rolled out in the preceding months.

It went on to say that even if principals had the knowledge and felt confident to do the assessment, there would be a conflict of interest. Principals assign the additional needs resources within a school and should not also be responsible for assessing what is needed.AsIAm states the process would make relationships between school and home more fraught. We saw what happened to waiting lists when the agency tried to water down the required AON process. The court struck this down and so many thousands of assessments had to be redone, greatly extending the times. The Minister of State said following up with an educational psychiatrist is only a stopgap. Is it? Is there a timeline in which the child can get an educational psychologist's AON?

This is purely in relation to the educational component of the assessment of need, not the health component. The review in June and monthly monitoring will be important, as will engagement with the Department and NCSE. There are supports available for schools. There is detailed AON guidance and a short video, and there are also email supports and a health line. If further supports are deemed necessary during the implementation phase and the monitoring of the process, the Department and NCSE must commit to providing them to individual schools. From the feedback we have received, the form takes only between 20 and 30 minutes to complete at primary level and maybe up to 60 minutes at post-primary level. All the feedback has been collated and included in the revised documents. We are confident they will work and that schools will embrace them.

I acknowledge the efforts of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, the Department and the Minister in trying to resolve this. Could the Minister outline the plans for new primary and secondary school developments in Limerick city to support the steep population growth targeted for the city under the national planning framework and make a statement on the matter?

Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data and school enrolment data, in addition to information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements. As part of the Department's commitment to the national planning framework, as part of Project Ireland 2040, and with the objective of ensuring appropriate educational provision for future populations, my Department engages proactively with the 31 local authorities in the development of their statutory plans. In the context of Limerick city, my Department has had regular engagement with Limerick City and County Council through the development and adoption of its development plan for the period 2022 to 2028. This has allowed my Department to plan for projected population growth of 30,000 people in Limerick city over the course of the development plan and in the context of projected overall population growth of over 50,000 in the city by 2040. However, it is important to note that the impact of population growth on school place requirements is mitigated by changing demographic trends. Despite projected national population growth, the number of primary students is forecast to reduce by 100,000 over the next decade. While post-primary enrolments are expected to peak in 2024, they are forecast to decline by 70,000 over the subsequent ten years. The impact on school places of the projected population growth in Limerick city is being considered in that context, with a view to identifying any further accommodation solutions required to meet the capacity requirements. However, as I know the Deputy is aware, it is important to note that my Department is already delivering significant additional capacity at schools in the city as part of its capital programme. Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025. There will be a rolling five-year funding envelope, which will be updated annually for the period 2026 to 2030 within the Government's overall national development plan funding envelope of €136 billion in Exchequer capital – €165 billion total capital including non-Exchequer capital. This will facilitate the building of modern and sustainable school infrastructure.

I want to dig into it a little and talk about the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040, a very positive plan that we are following. There is to be a statutory review of the plan next year, as I understand it. In the case of Limerick, we can see that what is actually happening and what is projected under the national planning framework are misaligned. We must think about planning our city in a manner that moves away from what is known in transport, education and other sectors that invest in major infrastructure as the predict-and-provide model and looks towards using infrastructure to induce growth and development in the right places. Where schools are built, the population follows, as we have seen throughout history. I want to dig into this a little more. I would be very interested in meeting the staff in the unit in the Department that examines demographics and the siting of new schools if the Minister could facilitate it.

Specifically on that issue, recently over 100 additional places have been provided in Limerick, 44 of which have been provided in recent weeks. There is a school in a position to make provision for the 26 pupils the Deputy referred to. Principals on the ground, particularly the chair of the Limerick Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, have confirmed they are confident the 26 pupils will be provided for in existing accommodation. Specifically on the commitment to Limerick city, I want to take the opportunity to outline significant developments there. These include two newly established 1,000-pupil post-primary schools, namely Mungret Community College and Limerick Educate Together Secondary School, both of which are currently in construction. New school buildings providing additional capacity are planned for Laurel Hill Secondary School, Laurel Hill Coláiste FCJ, Ardscoil Mhuire and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, while there are extensions planned at Coláiste Mhichíl and Castletroy College.

We welcome them in Limerick. They point to a future for the city in which the population is rebalanced back towards the centre. The Minister mentioned Laurel Hill and Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh. The latter is a very exciting project in my locality and we hope it will be open very soon. Construction is going very well. When it comes to locating new schools, we must be careful not to build on the edges of urban areas continually. Doing so exacerbates the sprawl that has left us in the very car-dependent society we have. The Gaelcholáiste is an exception to that. The Minister should consider other school developments in Limerick that are good in many ways but that will not address the sprawl we see in our towns and cities. It is critical, from a climate perspective, that we get the location of schools right. Will it be possible for me to meet the staff in the unit that examines the demographics in and plans new schools for Limerick? I would appreciate that.

At primary level, a project for a new 32-classroom school building for Monaleen National School is planned. Gaelscoil Sheoirse and St. Mary's National School both have major refurbishment projects under way. Projects for new school buildings for both Red Hill School and St. Vincent's Special School are also in train. In total, there are 32 schools building projects in Limerick at various stages of planning and delivery. That represents a significant investment and testament to the Department's confidence in what is happening in Limerick city and county.The Department will continue to work to advance planned and current projects in Limerick city. I acknowledge the holistic view the Department takes with regard to location and meeting demographic needs. We will continue to do that.

The provision of those targeted supports to more schools will benefit a great many students. More than 240,000 students are now able to avail of DEIS supports. More than 1,200 schools are involved in the scheme. As the Minister will know, every Deputy has schools in his or her area that were disappointed not to be included in the extension. I sincerely hope that it will be possible to extend this very important programme further. The Minister did excellent work last year in extending it but more good work could be done with a further extension of this very important and worthwhile scheme, which benefits the most disadvantaged students.

The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, including DEIS schools and non-DEIS schools, to support the inclusion of all students and to address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing the universal supports available to all schools, the DEIS programme is a key policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated - the word "concentrated" is key - educational disadvantage at school level in a targeted and equitable way across the primary and post-primary sector. As the Deputy has referenced, in March last year, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme. The programme was significantly expanded for the first time since 2017 and now covers an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes over 1,200 schools and supports approximately 240,000 students. This means one in every four of our students now benefits from DEIS programme supports. This recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to my Department’s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for the programme to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme. Analysis has shown that, since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving populations experiencing the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. It has provided children who come to education at a disadvantage with an equitable opportunity to achieve their potential in education. The extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one component of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Since June 2020 and over the past three budgets, I have secured funding to provide measures to support children in this regard. As part of budget 2023, as we referenced earlier, I announced over €50 million to provide schoolbooks and I reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to its lowest ever level, 23:1. This is a consequence of a reduction in each of the budgets I have presided over.

I very much welcome her provision of additional funding for services to be provided universally to all students regardless of the particular school they attend. I previously discussed with the Minister two particular schools in Cavan that were excluded this time. I have detailed notes prepared and may talk to the Minister about those particular schools later today. It is hard for any of us to explain how the scheme works in centres where there are a number of primary schools. I think of one town where there are three primary schools - a boys' school, a girls' school and a Church of Ireland school. Children from the same family may go to two different schools, one of which is in the DEIS programme while the other is not. It is very hard to explain to a parent why her daughter is availing of the additional supports that come with DEIS status in her school while her son is not able to avail of the same additional educational provision in his. This also applies in towns where there is a school under the patronage of a minority church. I know of instances of children being transferred and of new entrants not going to the school they traditionally would have attended because of the extra attraction of another school being in the DEIS programme. We need to take account of situations in which there are a number of schools in one centre, not all of which are in the DEIS programme.

As I said, the key issue here is concentrated levels of disadvantage. I fully accept that there will always be children at risk of educational disadvantage in any school. I appreciate that. The specific supports that come with DEIS status are provided where there are concentrated levels of disadvantage. I accept the point the Deputy has raised about one school in a community receiving such status while another does not but, unless the exact same students with the exact same backgrounds attend both schools, there will not be the same level of concentration. That is the point. I am not for one minute suggesting that there are not students at risk of educational disadvantage in both of the schools in the area the Deputy referred to but it is the level of concentration that determines whether a school receives DEIS status. Following the national census in 2022, which was held on 3 April last, it is envisaged that an updated Haase-Pratschke, HP, deprivation index will be generated by Pobal. That will be available in the third quarter of 2023. The Department will engage with Pobal in respect of this process. The updated HP deprivation index will inform the variety of different layers of support we may be able to offer schools.

I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on the progress that has been made in ensuring a substantial expansion in the provision of special education. At that time, I questioned whether the input of the local inspector or cigire was factored into planning. Years ago, the views of the local inspector, who covered a county or half a county, were critical in determining future plans with regard to both the provision of accommodation and the level of teaching support for schools. Is the role of the inspector critical in assessments for the DEIS programme? We can have algorithms and censuses but there is nothing to beat up-to-date local knowledge as to the needs of the local school community. I am a firm believer in ensuring that the knowledge of the local inspector is factored into all decision-making by the Department.

I am very conscious of the need to ensure supports across all schools because there are children at risk of educational disadvantage across all schools. It is for this reason that, as I stated earlier, we have introduced a variety of different measures, including measures with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, a free books scheme at a cost of more than €50 million, a pilot programme of counselling services in our primary schools and so on. As a consequence of the new HP index being formulated, the next phase of work will begin within my Department. We will look at a variety of types of supports that can be rolled out to schools to meet their needs. These may not necessarily involve DEIS status. There will be a kind of stepped system. There will be DEIS status, another step and then the next. On the specific point the Deputy raised regarding special education, he will be aware of the role of the special educational needs organiser, SENO. Considerable additional resources have been made available to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to boost its work and the availability of SENOs to communicate with parents on the ground to obtain the fullest picture possible of the needs of the student, which the SENOs then filter back to the NCSE.

Obviously, planning in respect of special school placements does not relate only to Cork, but to the rest of the country as well. However, Cork and Dublin are probably the most densely populated areas, which has an impact with regard to forward planning. I am not sure if the Deputy was in the Chamber earlier on but I outlined some of the initiatives that the Department and the NCSE are taking in respect of forward planning, which was lacking in the past. We have undertaken a number of different initiatives, which are now bearing fruit in the classes we are delivering. We have 600 new special classes at primary level and 300 at post-primary level. I will get into the detail of what is currently available in Cork but I will first very briefly outline some of the initiatives being undertaken. We have a geographical information system, which shares real-time data on the capacity we have across the schools system.We have new technical guidance for building projects. We have future-proofing at post-primary level with the incorporation of four special classes in all new 1,000-student post-primary schools. We are working in respect of the fee-charging sector, modular accommodation, existing planning exemptions, project management support and so on. For Cork specifically, over the last three years the NCSE sanctioned 103 new special classes at primary level and 46 new special classes at post-primary level. On special school placements, which the Deputy is asking about specifically, there are 15 special schools in Cork at present catering for 970 children. Rochestown Community Special School is to open later this year and Carrigaline school opened in 2021, as the Deputy knows. I have visited both Carrigaline Community Special School and St. Mary's Rochestown. They are doing incredible work in Cork.

I have witnessed it in my constituency where many classes have been sanctioned. Some are still awaiting delivery but nonetheless it is progress. We all know what happened a year ago with the delivery of Carrigaline and the scramble that happened there. Again, it is progress, places were made available and students were catered for. That said, before I came in here this morning I rang the principals of five special schools in Cork, five of the 15 the Minister of State mentioned. All are full for next September. I was listening to Deputy Ó Laoghaire earlier. Specifically, what capacity is available for September? The Minister of State might not have the number here today but I would appreciate if she could get a figure to tell us how many places are available. The families contacting my office and Deputy Ó Laoghaire's office are concerned about the lack of places for September.

There is extremely intense engagement going on with a lot of the special schools at present in terms of providing additional capacity. Some of the initiatives I outlined to the Deputy were for that very reason. Some of them will be able to add existing accommodation and reconfiguration to the schools that they have themselves. Three special schools have been opened in recent years and two more are opening during the school year. Rochestown Community School is to open later this year. For September 2023 specifically, detailed analysis of the particular needs of each child is being looked at. Of course, some places may become vacant as some pupils will leave during the summer as well. The NCSE is working nationally, regionally and at local level. What I would say to those schools is to engage constructively with the NCSE in terms of what capacity they have and also on special classes.

I cannot find one at the moment in the city or its hinterland. That is the concern. It is our job to relay that concern to the Minister of State. My question was specifically in respect of special school places. If the Minister of State has a figure I would appreciate if she could give clarification. On ASD classes, which is an aside from the question, I would like to ask what is happening in the Department when ASD classes are sanctioned but are yet to be delivered. I have come across cases where ASD classes were sanctioned as far back as 2017 or 2018 but are yet to be delivered. Who in the Department oversees that to ensure the classes are delivered and people are not just resting on their laurels while time goes by?

As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, children have to travel long distances if they can get a place. East Cork is as big as some small counties but there is no special school. I note the need for special classes and all that but special schools are a set apart. Would the Minister of State ask her officials to look east Cork, in particular Midleton or Youghal, and establish a special school there where there is nothing at the moment?

There is a site as well in Glanmire which I may not have mentioned. There is agreement in principle in respect of that acquisition. It is being progressed through conveyancing with the Chief State Solicitor's office at present. There is a detailed breakdown on the NCSE website of what is there. I am aware of Deputy Stanton's particular concern in east Cork. There is intensive engagement. In response to Deputy O'Sullivan, it is a fool's errand for me to give any figures. What I can say is that these children are known to the NCSE. Because of the enhanced forward planning that is available, the NCSE is well aware of where the children are, who needs an appropriate placement and where it is needed. I would say to Deputy Stanton that we endeavour to find a place in the locality for a child where possible. The number of children changes on a regular basis but we are aware of those who need places and we are working really hard and intensively to ensure every child has an appropriate placement.

In particular, there are insufficient specialised units for young people with autism, or autistic young people. The lack of proper spaces and adequate supports is a breach of their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it is a source of considerable concern for families. What assurances can the Minister of State give them that she will provide sufficient school places?

There is real representation from Cork in the Chamber this morning. It shows the level of commitment but also of concern from the county and city on the part of the public representatives in respect of special education. It is important to stress that 92% of special classes are to support autism in general terms. That would apply to Cork as well. It is interesting to look at the research from Cork conducted during 2020 and 2021. The Department and the NCSE had been using a prevalence rate for autism of 1.55% since 2014. The research from Cork from 2020 and 2021 put that at 3.38%, a significant growth. That is something the Department and the NCSE are trying to mitigate in terms of forward planning. It is not just that there are more children but also that more children are being diagnosed with autism and they need to be catered for. I mentioned earlier to the Deputy's Cork colleagues that there are 15 special schools in Cork at the moment catering for 970 children, some of whom have autism. There will be an increased need for autism classes at primary level, especially among young children. Part of that is because the prevalence rate has increased. There are 23 early intervention classes in Cork, therefore, and 15 special schools, as I mentioned. Overall in Cork there are 299 special classes at primary level and 42 of those are new. There are 121 at post-primary level, 23 of which are new. That is 420 special classes in total of which 65 are new.

The Minister of State says there are 15 special schools in County Cork. That is wonderful but there is not one special school in all of Cork South-West although it is one of the biggest constituencies in the country. The inadequacy of education and healthcare supports for children with disabilities is one of the issues I raise most frequently. I have repeatedly called for the provision of resources for national and secondary schools in Cork South-West and across Ireland and for the Government to finally provide appropriate education for children and young people. There are examples of best practice to be found in schools across my constituency and, I am sure, in others - principals, staff, parents and students themselves all working to help to create incredibly inclusive and progressive environments. It is important to highlight that they are improving but I am working with many parents who have had to keep their children in primary school for an additional, unnecessary year or have had to travel over an hour away due to a lack of local places. This is just the reality faced by so many families in Ireland at the moment.What is being done for these families? What is the urgent response?

Behind all of those statistics are individual families and individual appropriate placements. I allude to them simply to show the Deputy the progress that has been made but not to take away from the fact that a huge amount still needs to be done, particularly around post-primary education. That is why we have written to all post-primary schools and the Department and NCSE met the main post-primary school management bodies last week to share a list of schools that could potentially open new special classes in September 2023. I know that the NCSE is directly engaging with those schools to establish special classes. Over the last three years there has been an increase in special classes in Cork. It is about collaboration. We have the section 37A measure in legislation if we need to trigger it, as well as the section 67 designation of an individual child. However, we try to collaborate with the schools prior to having to instigate those mechanisms.

The Minister of State highlighted there that there is more of a problem with secondary school places but that does not make any sense. We know how many people are coming through the primary school system so I do not understand how forward planning cannot be done to ensure there are places for those students. Schools need more resources, as does the NCSE given the difficulty in contacting it and the slowness of its replies. I also want to repeat my call for a special school in Cork South-West. Families have come together to form a campaign and seek this in recognition of their children's needs. ASD and other units attached to existing schools are essential and these families have pointed out the need for special services. We are a stage where our awareness of diverse needs and the State's obligations mean that all areas of the country need units in schools and special schools to offer tailored supports. What is the Minister of State's message to the campaigners for a special school in Cork South-West?

Other colleagues, including Deputy Stanton, have requested another special school in Cork as well. I mentioned earlier some of the initiatives that are being taken around forward planning because I am not convinced that it was done adequately in the past. That has been acknowledged and that was obvious because there were gaps. That is why that work is being done but it will take a while before it delivers to exact standards, as it should. Having said that, there is serious engagement with the NCSE, the Department and schools, not just in County Cork but throughout the country, to ensure we have sufficient placements. Again, we have written to the post-primary schools and the primary schools are also aware of it. They know the legislation is there but we want to try to collaborate with them before we have to try to instigate that legislation.

He became the first non-verbal autistic person in Ireland to write a book. That was possible because he had the use of the rapid prompting method, RPM, which is a technology that helps non-verbal people with autism. Clearly there is potential with this method and parents and many others are encouraging the Department to look at a pilot project.

His first question was specifically on Louth but I have no difficulty in taking this one. I met Fiacre Ryan last week, along with his mother. He has written a book, Speechless, which the Deputy is probably aware of. It is incredible for a non-verbal autistic child to write a book. His mother correctly made the point to me that just because someone has autism does not mean they are not intelligent, and he is clearly an extremely intelligent young man. He learned through the method to which the Deputy alludes and about which Deputy Ó Murchú has asked. The Department and the NCSE, however, are of the view that it is important to recognise that students with autism have many different types of needs and that those needs change as they grow and move through the education system, so it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. There can be nuances and variance throughout the system. Over the years advocates of different approaches have spoken to the Department in support of the educational needs of children with autism and they have asked Ministers and the Department of Education to adopt or use those approaches in schools. It is all about what is right for the particular child. It is personal to the children themselves and it depends on what is in their best interests. If RPM works for that child and is of value to that child, it is something that can be used but it does not have to be. There is a wide range of teaching approaches that are employed by class teachers and to support that important work there is the autism good practice guidance, which supports children and young people as a resource for schools and others.

That is encouraging. I take the point that you have to cut your cloth to measure and that different children will require different things. No one is suggesting that it will be a silver bullet but a request has been made for a pilot programme to be examined. The Minister of State says it can be used, but this stuff is not free. As things stand, if a child requires RPM and a school believes it is beneficial, will the Department fund it? Is there scope for the Department to fund it as things stand?

Officials in the Department are aware of the benefits of RPM but at the same time they say that there is no clear empirical evidence to underpin it and that the guidance suggests that a range of supports may need to be adopted for each child. Schools are not prohibited from using RPM but it will not necessarily be for every child and there are supports available for students who are non-verbal under the assistive technology scheme as well, which the Deputy will be aware of. All schools have access to IT funding to purchase assistive technology and, where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software, which will be more bespoke to a particular child, from existing school resources or funds. Then schools that have children with more complex disabilities can make an application for such equipment to the NCSE.

A pilot would potentially be of benefit. The point about empirical evidence is fair enough but some of that might be down to a lack of research so a pilot might help to establish an evidential basis. The Minister of State can talk about schools being at liberty to use RPM but that is not necessarily to say they have the resources to use it. As I said, these things are not for free. I am glad the Minister of State is taking this on board and is aware of it. I hope that behind the scenes the Department can examine this carefully because in the instance of Fiacre Ryan and many other children and adults across the world, it has had clear benefits.

However, one school was using it and when the inspector visited the school they told it to stop, so schools are being prohibited from using this method. RPM has been used in America for 20 years. It has a proven track record there and it has been used in other jurisdictions as well. It is something that works for children. It was working well in the school in which it was being used, as I have mentioned, but then it was suddenly stopped. It has devastating results if RPM is stopped as it is something that was used by the teacher in the school. It is something that is worth investigating and if it works for children, as it has worked for Fiacre Ryan, it has to be explored in more detail.

If there is a particular school where there is an issue, perhaps the Deputy could let me or the Department know about it.RPM encourages those who are struggling to communicate to use techniques that include writing, typing or pointing. Other organisations might have concerns about this method, notwithstanding its successes for some children. The Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists, for example, released a statement in 2017 that outlined its concerns regarding the use of the method. Having said that, I met with Fiacre and Carmel Ryan and spoke with them. It is incredible how Fiacre Ryan has been able to write a book, not to mind his ability to function on a daily basis. RPM also helped his confidence. There are different methods that can work for different children. Again, this technology scheme is a case in point.

In the current school year, more than 147,900 children, including over 18,000 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition, school transport scheme services are being provided in the current school year to just over 3,800 children and young people who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. The total cost of the scheme in 2022 was €332.2 million. A review of the school transport scheme commenced in 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and its sustainability, and to ensure it serves students and their families adequately. Significant consultation has been undertaken as part of this review. A public survey was administered for parents, guardians and students who use the service and, perhaps more importantly, those who do not use the service but would like to be in a position to access it. A broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments were all consulted as part of this review. Phase 1 of the review examined the impact of the eligibility criteria on mainstream pupils who were eligible for transport to their nearest school but attending their next-nearest school. The report was completed in June 2021. Following consideration of this report, the provision of temporary alleviation measures for transport for the 2021-22 school year was approved for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport, but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time. These measures have continued and are provided for in the 2022-23 school year, pending completion of the review. These measures mean that transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second-nearest school, and who applied for school transport and paid on time. Phase 2 of the review has progressed significantly and is being completed in tandem with phase 3 which has also begun. While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the current conflict in Ukraine and by the increased demand for the scheme in summer 2022, officials are working to complete phase 3 of the review within the coming weeks, with recommendations on the future operation of the Department’s school transport scheme then being made. Once approved by the Government, it is planned that the review will be published.

I presume changes to the scheme will be in place for September 2023. I will raise a situation that arises in the townland in which I live, where a cluster of students are attending their second-nearest school in Cavan town. There are four secondary schools in that town. Historically, students in the area where I live have gone to Cavan town rather than the nearest school in Ballyjamesduff. They are only seen as concessionary students but if they avail of a concessionary ticket, they have to travel up to 4 km to get the bus, which means there are maybe ten or 12 parents who are dropping students off to the bus at a distance of 4 km, returning home, and then again travelling 4 km to the bus and returning home. Parents are travelling a lot, which means fuel costs and extra traffic on the road, if we take climate action concerns into consideration. Will the Department consider expanding the scheme where there is a cluster of students who would traditionally be seen as concessionary-based students? I live in the Kilnaleck area of Cavan, where this issue is arising. I am sure it arises in other areas too.

The Deputy specifically referenced the issue of the next-nearest school at post-primary level. That temporary alleviation measure was introduced for the 2021-22 school year and continued for 2022-23. There is a criterion for eligibility, namely, that students have to live within 3.2 km of their primary school and be attending the nearest school. At post-primary level, the distance is 4.8 km and students must be attending their nearest or next-nearest school. I am conscious of the issue around Kilnaleck the Deputy raised. As she said, school preference there is historical. I acknowledge that this has also been raised with me very specifically. Indeed, Deputy Niamh Smyth tabled a question in respect of it and it has also been raised by other Deputies in the constituency. To be very clear, eligibility criteria are very much part of the review process. We are looking at eligibility in respect of distance, nearest school, next-nearest school and so on.

That adds up to €1,300 per year, not including exam periods if students are in third or sixth year. Quite a number of students this year who would traditionally have been concessionary ticket holders lost out on their bus places. This was because the transport offered was free and those who were eligible but never previously used the transport applied for tickets and were given them ahead of those who had used them for possibly ten to 15 years. I have been contacted by parents this week who still have no school bus places for their students to get them to school. Will capacity be increased? Will transport be free as we come into the next school year? Has a decision been made regarding that?

Last year's free school transport scheme was fantastic. It had its teething problems but the very concept of it was one of the most positive we have had in years. Our colleague in the Government, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, believes in public transport, as we all do. While it takes years to build railway networks, which are very linear and do not go everywhere, a school bus is transformative in a rural community. It takes 50 passengers and keeps 50 cars at home, which allows parents to go to work and save some time in the mornings. It was one of the best schemes I have seen this Government introduce. I would love to see it rolled out even further. As someone said to me, five buses equals one train. We can get to wherever we want to get to from a climate change perspective much quicker by having buses on the road. I used to teach in Parteen school, which is a small rural school, where each morning and afternoon 340 school drop-offs had to be done. Imagine what could be saved if we had more school transport. I again praise the Minister and her officials. I would love to see the school transport scheme expanded even further.

More than 25,600 additional places have been provided this year as a consequence of the scheme. That includes a 26% increase in provision for those with special educational needs. Everything is being looked at as part of the review, including costs, distance and all the other criteria. We are working as efficiently as possible in the Department to ensure we are in a position to have the review completed within the coming weeks, which is my expectation. It is an enormous body of work. I acknowledge the significant co-operation we have received from all stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students, the wider community, and the stakeholders and providers within the system. We are working assiduously to ensure the review will be completed in the coming weeks. When completed, it will be presented to the Government and there will be a requirement to engage with other Departments regarding our ability to progress matters. Once the review has been presented to the Government, it will be published.

Diúltaíodh é seo dóibh mar thoradh ar straitéis a bhí fuar, straitéis chalma, straitéis gan croí, a forbraíodh i gcroílár an Rialtais - Rialtas ina raibh Tánaiste féin mar pháirt agus mar bhall sinsearach. Up to 12,000 citizens of this State, many of them with profound disabilities, were denied their entitlement to a modest allowance paid to them in recognition of their disability. They were denied this as a result of a cold, callous and heartless strategy developed at the heart of government. This was a Cabinet of which the Tánaiste was a senior member as Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time. The decisions the Government took at the time are laid bare for all of us to see in secret documents that have been reported on. The Tánaiste was party to the strategy. He was party to agreeing the strategy as a senior member of the Government and Cabinet at that time. We now know that in July 2009 the Tánaiste and his Government colleagues were presented with a memo from the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. It made it clear the State was unlikely to defend cases by or on behalf of those who had their disability payments illegally withdrawn from them. The memo they were presented with went on to state that a comprehensive trawl could be done of HSE records over the 30 years to determine the level of exposure to the State but the Minister advised the Tánaiste and his colleagues against doing this as it would be unlikely to escape media attention or speculation and could generate further claims that otherwise would not have been made. The strategy of the Government was to conceal the fact there was no legal basis to denying these payments to persons with disabilities and to do nothing that would give rise to awareness to these individuals of their legal entitlements to a modest allowance in recognition of their disability. The strategy was deliberate, it was calculated and it was developed at a Cabinet of which the Tánaiste was a member to conceal from some of the most vulnerable citizens, namely those with disabilities in the care of the State, their legal entitlements. The following year, in 2010, again while he was a member of the Cabinet, he and his Cabinet colleagues were asked to agree to continue with the strategy. At that time he knew this denial of payments was unlawful and, again, he acceded to this. He was party to the decision and the Government agreed to it. The Tánaiste knew the right thing to do. How do we know this? We can see it in the memo. It is contained there. It was to establish a repayment scheme to right the wrong that was done but the Tánaiste and the Government decided against it. Not only that, they decided to do everything possible to ensure those entitled to these payments would never find out about their entitlements. It is very hurtful for so many families to find that Government after Government knew these payments were being withheld unlawfully and that a deliberate and cold-hearted strategy was developed at the heart of Government. Will the Tánaiste explain to the House and, most importantly, to those families why he was part of this? Knowing that the legal advice he got in the memo in 2009 was that these cases could not be defended, how does he justify continuing to deny these payments to the individuals and deciding to do nothing that would raise awareness, either in the media or among the wider public, that would alert people to their legal entitlements? Please explain that to all of us.
#MichealMartin	unknown-#MichealMartin-party	unknown-#MichealMartin-dob	unknown-#MichealMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	216	With regard to the nursing homes issue and the disability allowance, how they evolved was of an historic nature. The fundamental problem was that the public policy was transparent from the outset in respect of disability allowance and nursing home payments, going right back to the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Public policy was very transparent in respect of nursing homes. People paid a contribution and so forth. This was by virtue of regulations that had been put into place. Many decades later it transpired that those regulations were not consistent with the primary Act. That was the fundamental flaw. At that time the Government of the day took a decision to retrospectively pay back in a repayment scheme the payments taken from those availing of public nursing homes. With regard to the disabled person's maintenance allowance, a similar situation pertained in respect of the public policy being very transparent. That allowance was introduced in the first instance to provide for people who were on very low incomes when living independently. Once they went into residential care those payments were discontinued. This carried on for quite a long period and was publicly transparent. A case then emerged. It was the then Minister, the late Seamus Brennan, during the Government to which the Deputy referred, who corrected it. He took the decision that residents would be allowed to retain their domiciliary care allowance in a residential setting or a hospital. This was eventually rectified in the 2000s. By the way, it is something that has not been rectified in Northern Ireland. To this day, someone in a hospital or residential care in Northern Ireland for longer than four weeks gets a reduction. This was a public policy issue. The problem was that again the secondary legislation was wrongly drafted and inconsistent with the primary Act of 1970. Generally, a Government habitually gets updated, perhaps every six months, on what are called sensitive litigation cases or cases of major litigation. There could be 30 cases at any one time to which the Government is alerted. That list is culled from a further list of approximately 200 cases of litigation against the State in the Office of the Attorney General. I refer the Deputy to the fact that 20 years ago the Government established the State Claims Agency and took medical negligence and personal injuries cases out of the realm of the political arena. The State Claims Agency on behalf of the State decides, rightly or wrongly or insensitively or sensitively, the determination of how the State defends various cases. The net point in respect of this is that the focus of that Government was to improve substantially disability allowance payments in the 2000s and to use the resources for that generation. That call will always be made. In the past two and a half years, the Government has committed to approximately €6 billion in retrospective payments in three or four areas. Issues will arise and calls have to be made in respect of the needs of the current and future generations in terms of the allocation of resources. There will be good times and bad for public finances, and economies are cyclical. How one allocates these resources is a fundamental issue. At any one time there can be up to 30 sensitive cases before the Government. Ultimately, the Oireachtas and the Government of the day have to make decisions in this respect and not all of them are palatable or in any way desirable.

Yesterday the Taoiseach stood where the Tánaiste is and said the State did not have a leg to stand on. He said that because we have the memos. In 2009, the Tánaiste was given legal advice as a member of the Cabinet that said the State would be extremely unlikely to be able to defend the case. We have other memos that state the regulations were without legal foundation. They were unlawful. Let us cut to the chase. These individuals were unlawfully denied their payments by the State. That is crystal clear now. The Tánaiste was a member of the Cabinet that agreed to this strategy. He was asked in 2010 as a member of Cabinet to continue to agree to the strategy of the HSE denying all claims for back payments, despite the fact he knew they were unlawful at the time. He should not try to fob it on the State Claims agency or allocations of resources. This involves people who, in some cases, have profound disabilities who were in the care of the State. They expect their Government to stand up for them and advocate for them. The Government preyed on their vulnerability and stated it would not set up a repayment scheme unless the floodgates opened and more claims came forward. How does the Tánaiste justify this? Does he accept he was informed in 2009 and 2010 on these matters? How does he justify, knowing that it was unlawful, continuing to deny these individuals their payments and not taking any action even to identify the exposure of the State in case these vulnerable citizens became aware of their legal entitlement?

Since the outset of the terrible war in Ukraine and the brutal invasion by Russia nearly a year ago, we in Labour, alongside groups like the Ukraine Civil Society Forum, have been calling consistently for a more co-ordinated approach by Government to the housing of refugees and people seeking international protection here. We have called especially for a single and clear co-ordinated point of contact and centralised systems for managing the State response to this crisis. Back in December, it appeared as though our calls had been heard and we anticipated real change would come, but not so, it seems. Despite the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O’Brien, who is doing his best alongside the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department, we are still seeing the locating of housing and provision of resources for those fleeing war and hardship being done ad hoc by the Government. Despite that change in December there is still this ad hoc approach with insufficient communication with Opposition parties, local public representatives or communities offering solidarity. I agree with the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, when he says "no level of consultation" would change the views of some on housing refugees in their areas. What is needed is a centralised approach from Government to getting information out to local communities in a timely way when new accommodation is being opened to enable the provision of support to new residents in their area. Such a system would facilitate and support the amazing welcome shown across so many communities across the country, in both rural and urban areas, for those who seek refuge here. It is undeniable there are sinister actors who are trying to further a far-right agenda in all this. A small number of people are seeking to exploit the information vacuum to sow fear and distrust in local communities. We have seen some awful reports of intimidation of families and children by protesters. This week we saw disruption of a Labour public meeting and our public representatives threatened for expressing solidarity with refugees, so this is a very scary time. Those who engage in racist attacks must be condemned outright by all of us, but the Government has a responsibility here too. So far, we are not seeing sufficient cross-departmental support for the efforts of the Department of the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman. We especially need to see more from the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and more from the Tánaiste's Department of Defence in the form of the repurposing of barracks across the country. We are not even seeing sufficient resourcing for the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, to ensure it has capacity to provide accommodation. What will change? At the very least, will we see the allocation of additional resources to IPAS, perhaps the appointment a special Minister in the Department of Housing and a coherent, NPHET-style cross-departmental response co-ordinated by the Taoiseach with a CMO figure to take responsibility and act as a point person on this? Will we see a public information campaign and allocation of resources to communities to ensure supports can be rolled out for those who come here seeking refuge and supports to the local communities who wish to offer the céad míle fáilte to them?

Prior to Christmas, former Limerick city manager Conn Murray was appointed to co-ordinate the work on the accommodation side. It must be acknowledged this is by any distance the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State. We have never had such a level of refugees fleeing war coming into the country. People continue to arrive from Ukraine. It is quite shocking and I appreciate the Deputy's solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The Russian attack has been vicious, targeted against civilians and deliberately designed to create a migration crisis, along with an energy crisis and so on. Ireland has responded well to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, with about 72,000 people now benefitting from temporary protection in Ireland. About 15,000 international protection applicants have arrived here. Overall, we have accommodated about 73,000 in total, between Ukrainians and international protection applicants. The greatest pressure is on accommodation for the latter. My own Department has made Kilbride Army Camp available for international protection applicants. It had previously been available for Ukrainian refugees as a transit location. I am not clear what the Deputy means by the repurposing of barracks. There has been a significant policy over the last number of decades of closure of barracks and there is investment going into barracks for the purposes of the military. It is important we acknowledge the role of our Defence Forces and the importance of not undermining them in this process, but they are available to help and assist in any former barracks in standing up accommodation, for example. That facility has been made available to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I have made that very clear. On the communication issue, we acknowledge there can be better communication in respect of some aspects of this. The €50 million we have allocated to a community fund is very important and I would like to see that done strategically in response to genuine needs within communities who have been very welcoming and who have large numbers of refugees and international protection applicants in their areas. That fund will be under the Minister for Rural and Community Development. It is an important fund for engaging with communities who have been very responsive. I pay tribute to many of the schools, people in education and teachers, who have gone to exceptional levels to work with Ukrainian children and young people on their educational needs, and I have witnessed that at first hand myself.

He has listed figures and mentioned the Cabinet sub-committee but as he said himself this is an unprecedented challenge, due to the scale of it, and we are not seeing from the Government the sort of scaled-up response required. We in the Opposition who are seeking to show solidarity are often finding out about plans in communities after the far right does and we want to work with communities to show support. I engaged with protesters seeking information in my constituency but I did not have information to provide to them. We need to see a more co-ordinated response from Government, a centralised point of contact and clear evidence of the cross-departmental approach that will give the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the support it clearly needs. The response I and others are getting to parliamentary questions is confirming the lack of support from other Government Departments for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are seeing clear evidence of lack of capacity in IPAS to address this unprecedented challenge. We must ensure there are supports in place for communities. Communities are stepping up and showing incredible support and an incredible welcome but we need to see Government working with the Opposition. I welcome the cross-party committee that is being planned but we must see a stronger, Covid-style response from the Government at a centralised level to this.

We will work on some of the suggestions the Deputy has made. There is cross-departmental engagement. The Department of Justice is heavily involved in this on the international protection aspect.The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is also. The Office of Public Works, OPW, in the first phase of modular housing has made significant progress and the first houses will be coming onstream within weeks in respect of the rapid build. We want to develop that and accelerate the pace of rapid build for both refugees and also for the purposes of social housing and then the reconfiguration of building. All of that work is under way. It is not fair to say that other Departments are not supporting the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

To be fair, when one thinks of the work of the Department of Social Protection, for example, there has been tremendous work done in facilitating people.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	267	Can the Tánaiste explain to the public why successive Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led Governments, including many he was a part of, have pursued a systematic strategy over many years of denying rights and entitlements to vulnerable people and to people who have been wronged by the State, often pursuing a very hostile, cynical legal strategy to deny people their rights? Vulnerable people in long-term residential care with disabilities were denied their disability allowances; before that we had women affected by CervicalCheck and scandals subjected to a very hostile legal strategy. Last night, we had the Government yet again excluding tens of thousands of mothers and children who were victims of the abuse by church and State in mother and baby homes, arbitrarily and unjustifiably excluded from the redress scheme. Then, of course, there is the scandal of the nursing homes fees wrongly levied on vulnerable, often elderly, unwell people. The Government has fought them every step of the way, legally and otherwise, to deny them their rights and entitlements and has used legal strategies to prevent them from getting those entitlements and to hush them up in instances where it was forced, because of legal action, to acknowledge the refunds to which they were entitled. I ask the Tánaiste this very particularly as he was Minister for Health between 2000 and 2004. In that year, the Report on Nursing Home Subventions was laid before him containing 70 pages detailing how successive Governments knew that the fees being charged in nursing homes were illegal, that there was no legal basis for them-----

By the way the report also found, and this is important, that people who had gone to private nursing homes were, in fact, entitled to public nursing home care but none were available to them and they were forced into the private system. The Tánaiste is still saying these people were not entitled to this care when that report made it clear that they were. Another report in 2003 by the Human Rights Commission said the same thing. There was another report in 2010 by the Ombudsman, entitled Who Cares?, while the Tánaiste was Minister in the Government. Where was his moral compass when it came to acknowledging the rights and entitlements of vulnerable people? How could he treat people in that disgusting fashion?

If we go back over the past 25 years, right through it, there were quite a significant number of redress schemes. One of my first decisions was to launch the very first investigation into the role of church and State in the industrial schools. This was the first time it was ever done and we had a very extensive redress scheme in the aftermath of the commission on institutional abuse in our industrial schools. I think at the time I raised more than €1 billion in redress payments. I was the first to do the investigation into the Ferns diocese and, subsequently, other Ministers did the Dublin archdiocese commission of investigation, the Cloyne report. The point is that the past 25 to 30 years has been about revelations about the 20th century in Ireland and, in many instances, significant redress schemes initiated. That is the reality. I have only just said earlier that in the past two and a half years alone, the Government has decided to commit itself to retrospective payments on a range of issues totalling close to €6 billion. I am not counting all the various redress schemes over the past ten or 20 years. The fundamental issue with nursing home charges and the disability allowance was actually that the policy was transparent for well over 30 years. It was very transparent in that contributions were taken in full sight from people in residential settings, from their pensions and so on. It transpired that the regulations that gave effect to that were not consistent with the primary Act in respect of public nursing home charges. That is what the 2005 Supreme Court decision conclusively decided on public health charges. A redress scheme of close to €500 million was initiated and paid back. In terms of the medical card patients in private nursing homes, it was never accepted by the Oireachtas or the Government that they were entitled to the entirely of payments in respect of the cost of private nursing homes. Subventions at that stage were the order of the day. In fact, the fair deal scheme, which ultimately dealt with the issue in terms of a legislative template, to this day continues the principle of people making a contribution to both public and private healthcare. The same applies in Northern Ireland in respect of disability allowance. As I have said, right now there are 30 sensitive cases that the Government will be alerted to, all of them with significant cost implications for the State. The ultimate challenge is, which we have to make a call on - every Government will in its day - whether the current generation keeps on paying for historic wrongs or whether we concentrate and focus on the needs, which are very real today, right across the board in social services and social work.

It made very clear that successive Governments, including the one he was part of, knew that the basis on which these charges were being levied had no legal basis. He has gone on to repeat what the Taoiseach said earlier this week about the State still not conceding that people who were in private nursing homes but had medical cards had the right to have the fees paid. The Ombudsman report I am referring to noted in 2001, when the Tánaiste was the Minister for Health: "The health boards appear to be directing such patients and their families towards private care without in anyway acknowledging the boards' own responsibilities in this area." People were being forced into private nursing homes because the State had failed to provide them the public nursing home care they were entitled to and the Tánaiste knew this. He knew the charges that were being levied had no legal basis long before courts made decisions on it and he did nothing about it. Vulnerable people had to fight and face hostile legal strategies. It is immoral.

Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated publicly that this ring-road cannot proceed because we would be breaking laws. This comes on foot of a fresh review that is going to be done by An Bord Pleanála. For the people of Galway, there is much confusion concerning what is going on. What is the Government's policy and what are we doing in Galway city? We have businesspeople who have been advocating for this project for the last ten to 15 years. We have probably spent €25 million to €30 million on doing planning permissions. These have failed, gone to Europe or whatever. We have then started off again. We have land that has been frozen for the last eight to ten years and houses that cannot be sold because they are on this preferred route for a road. We have people travelling into and out of work stuck for maybe 90 minutes each way on a small section to get into the city from the east and south of the county. We have uncertain development regarding the city, which is the engine for the region to develop. I will give the Tánaiste one small example. We need to put in a new fire station in Galway city but we cannot decide on what site we are going to put it on until we decide on the outer bypass. Yesterday, I think the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that this cannot go ahead and cannot proceed. What is happening is that people are wondering what the Government's policy is here. Are we building an outer bypass, are we doing something else or are we doing nothing at all? This is in the national development plan as a project to be done and it is part of the programme for Government. The people of Galway and the region, though, deserve better than just a flippant announcement yesterday that this project cannot proceed, while at same time An Bord Pleanála is going to review the application again. Is this announcement pre-empting its decision? What is the Government's policy regarding this outer ring road? We have been told the climate action laws must be adhered to and that we cannot break them. Will somebody tell me if we are breaking laws right now by proposing to undertake this outer ring road? Should we be up-front with people and tell them what we are going to do? We had talk about a light rail system for Galway city. We have also had talk about other things for Galway city and all we have are reports upon reports upon studies. We do not even have one park-and-ride facility in Galway city now. Going back to the time of the former Deputy, Noel Dempsey, when he was the Minister for Transport he opened a section of a bus lane in 2007 in Claregalway. The second section of this bus lane has not yet been done. We do not need to acquire land for this endeavour, it is just tied up in paper.

I, along with many people, see the N6 Galway city ring road project as essential in terms of the growth and development of Galway city and also for the relief of unacceptable congestion there. The current congestion is contributing negatively to climate change targets. With the current volume of vehicles on the existing network, we all know and we can all see that Galway city is suffering from extreme congestion in its centre and increased journey times. I was recently at the opening of the Macroom bypass. In jest afterwards, I said that we had liberated Macroom. The point being that the quality of life in Macroom now is vastly improved because of the Ballyvourney bypass in terms of congestion, air pollution, climate change targets etc. in the sense that traffic and gridlock cause vehicles to emit fossil fuels for a longer period than they perhaps should be. In any event, the relief to people there is palpable. Galway city has suffered for decades now because of the failure to progress this project. It has been held up in the planning arena. The clear Government position is as per the programme for Government and the national development plan agreed for 2021 to 2030, which is that this proposed project is to go ahead. This proposed project is included in the national development plan and this remains the Government's position. Obviously, people have different perspectives and the Minister made remarks yesterday in respect of the broader issue.

What the Tánaiste is saying is great, but where does the Minister for Transport stand in this? The body which will fund this project is the Department of Transport. Will we, therefore, get a clear Government message on this project? I will repeat what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said. He said this road cannot proceed and that we must take the climate action laws into account. Effectively, then, people are wondering what in the name of God is happening here and can we have clear leadership regarding what is going to happen so we do not have any more confusion. Personally, I believe the An Bord Pleanála review is compromised if the Department of Transport and the Minister who is the head of it, and also the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, has said that this project cannot proceed and that we must work within the laws. This is very confusing. It is not right that a project of this nature, as the Tánaiste set out, is being put out there in a cloud of indecision and uncertainty. We do not know what is happening.

As the Deputy knows, Galway City Council and Galway County Council issued a joint statement with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, this week in which they indicated they remain committed to the delivery of the N6 Galway city ring road. The Government's position is as per the national development plan and this project is included in the allocation of resources over ten years of that plan. The then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, allocated these resources and this was agreed by the Cabinet. It was also agreed by the three party leaders, along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This is the formal position and there has been no change in this regard in respect of the Galway city ring road.

This means there has been a 3% increase since June 2022, and it will have an immediate impact on those with tracker mortgages. Approximately 200,000 households are in this position. There are also tens of thousands of borrowers with other mortgages who have had their mortgages sold off to vulture funds. Many of these are now facing interest rates of 7.5%, and this will increase again in March to about 8%. These people have no option to fix their mortgage rates and to go on to one of the different options the banks have because the vulture funds do not offer this. Despite these people having been reassured time and again that vulture funds provided the same protections and safeguards as the banks, this is not the case. These increases since June, then, are going to add thousands of euro to these people's annual repayments and they are already under pressure as a result of the cost-of-living crisis. I am, therefore, asking the Tánaiste to introduce a timely, temporary and targeted mortgage interest relief.It can be done by introducing a relief that would absorb a portion of the interest costs that have incurred since June. It is sensible. Will the Tánaiste commit to reviewing and looking at an interest relief?

Across Europe, interest rates have been rising. The ECB has hiked its key policy interest rates by 2.5% since last July. Individual lenders will respond as to whether they will pass on these increases. To date, retail banks have increased fixed rates for new or switching customers but have not increased their variable rates. Some non-bank lenders have raised variable interest rates. We will keep the issue under review. The average interest rate on new mortgages in Ireland is now 2.57%. The average across the eurozone is 2.84%. Ireland's rates are now the third lowest in the euro area, after Malta and France. That is poor consolation for those who have had increases in interest rates because of the inflationary macroeconomic environment we are currently experiencing.

It is not just in the tech sector; I met just this week with employees of Argos in my constituency who are also facing similar news. Workers and their families will pay a high price in these cases. Will the Government initiate a review on the effect of job losses, particularly those being announced in the tech sector, for indigenous businesses and jobs here?

It is important to say that the tech sector is extremely strong in Ireland right now. Many of the global decisions that have been taken are reversing part of the growth of last year, when many tech companies were employing very large numbers of people over a very short space of time. Google, for example, took on an extra 30,000 people last year and has made a decision to reduce its workforce by 12,000 this year. We do not know how that will impact Ireland yet.

It is a credit to the people of the Liberties that they have always insisted that the building not be allowed to die, even after 20 years of neglect. In honour of those people, who have put up with a lot of overdevelopment and lost a lot of Dublin's real heritage but are able to preserve this part of it, I am calling on the State to honour its commitment, as given by the Minister of State, who said:The building is far too important for Dublin and the country to lose it.

Some 80 of his 133-strong flock had been savaged. Councillor Michael O'Meara, who is a neighbour of this farmer, told me of the devastation and heartbreak suffered by the farmer and his family. The attack was caused by dogs whose owners had failed in their responsibility to keep them under control. These dogs were free to roam and maraud. Dog owners need to understand the damage and hurt caused by carelessness as we enter lambing season. Earlier this year, a young woman in Carrick-on-Suir was attacked and permanently scarred. She was terrorised and had to jump into the river to escape four loose pitbulls. The incidence of dog attacks on children across the country is escalating. We must act to enforce stronger laws and we must being forward robust legislation to enforce responsible dog ownership.

It is a serious worry for people when they have had a biopsy. Having to wait 20 weeks for it to be analysed is too long.

What we need to ensure is that the efforts that have been made by the healthcare professionals there are supported and we can sustain them right through the year. We must ensure the number of patients on trolleys that we saw a few weeks ago is consigned to history.

I refer both to the redress scheme and to the issue that has always been most pressing during the past decade, that is, access to information. The Birth Information and Tracing Bill has probably been the most radical legislation to come before us in the past year. It came through the House. It was a real priority identified by all concerned with this issue. The redress scheme is significantly in advance of what was recommended by the commission. It will include financial payments for an estimated 34,000 people and a form of enhanced medical card for an estimated 19,000 people. The approximate cost will be €800 million. The scheme is currently going through the House.

Certainly if Croke Park is not possible, a bigger venue than the 3Arena would be ideal. Some 80,000 fans in Croke Park cheering on Katie Taylor would be a fitting acknowledgement of the contribution she has made to Irish sport and to women in sport. Boxing has made such a contribution to communities throughout the country. Will the Government pull out all the stops to ensure Katie Taylor has her fight on 20 May with Amanda Serrano in Croke Park?

To that end, my very first meeting with anyone from outside the Department was with Katie Taylor's manager, Brian Peters, in the early part of January. It was explained to us that there was a funding gap between what the promoters were prepared to pay for the fight and what the fight would actually cost. We said that the Government absolutely supports major events, but there is a process to go through. Immediately after the meeting, we raised queries on what the cost would be and other details that would be necessary. The Department is currently considering responses to those queries. One of the difficulties is with the date. If one is doing the cost-benefit calculations with regard to tourism, which the major events have to go through, one must consider that the Heineken Cup final is already being hosted on 20 May. It is a huge event in European rugby and Dublin tourism will be full that night. A fight in November which was previously mooted for last year would have been an entirely different calculation. However, the consideration is still ongoing. Mr. Hearn said on some MMA channel yesterday that the Government had not been in touch, but that is simply not the case. There has been a range of meetings and correspondence in the past while.

I am speaking about ARFID and about Riain, a boy from County Tipperary whose case I have raised previously. He cannot get proper treatment within the health service, but he is not alone. More families are presenting with their own accounts of difficulty in accessing services, or even a pathway to treatment. Many get shoved from pillar to post between child and adolescent mental health services and the children's disability network teams, which just do not have the skills to treat people with ARFID who may also have autism spectrum disorder. People are being left aside. The health service is just not up to speed on ARFID, which is more common than even the families knew, such is the lack of proper services. Will the Tánaiste or the Minister for Health meet with these families to learn about their condition and the physical, emotional and financial impacts that a lack of medical pathways is having on them? Will they endeavour to improve the provision of services? Will either of them accept the offer to meet the families?

Many young people are now presenting with eating disorders or disordered eating. Last year, 504 children, young people and adolescents presented to the eating disorder teams. When this scheme was initially put in place in 2018, when the relevant data were in place, it would have been expected that approximately 50 children per year would present. Some 504 children needed these vital supports last year. I assume the Deputy is referring to community healthcare organisation 5. Funding has been provided for an eating disorder team in this area. Multidisciplinary team recruitment is under way, but it takes between 12 and 18 months to put a multidisciplinary team in place. There are also many inpatient supports for children with eating disorders. If the Deputy sends me on the relevant details, I will have a look at them.

When they were announced last year, they took 20 cent per litre off petrol, 15 cent off diesel, and 2 cent off green tractor diesel. Families are struggling. Many of them are on the edge and sick with worry at the end of every week about where they will find the money to pay exorbitant energy bills, or pay to put food on the table for their families. Farmers and fishermen are also under considerable pressure as they struggle to pay everyday bills in order that we can have food on our tables. As we have seen on the pumps in the past couple of days, fuel is starting to creep up again. It is vital that the fuel excise duty reduction is kept fully in place for the coming 12 months. If removed, fuel will shoot up to the same level it was at last year, which was totally unacceptable and will take many families into deep debt. Will the Tánaiste assure the Dáil that the excise duty reduction will be extended?

The Deputy is correct in saying that the expiry date is coming at the end of February. The Government will have a decision made in advance of that. It is being examined by the Government as we speak and will be examined in the coming weeks.

That is 40% of the total figure. The reply I received to a recent parliamentary question showed that the annual cost of accommodating an asylum seeker is €18,568. The mean wait time for the application to be processed is a year and a half. Thousands of people are waiting two or three years. One person has been waiting 14 years to have their application processed. It is absolutely incredible. However, the total cost of accommodating people who have arrived with false documentation or without documentation is €141 million per year, which is a high figure.Most Irish people want to do the right thing. They want to make sure that people who are fleeing war, violence and famine get the help they need but they also want to make sure the system is not abused.

No. 600 of 2001) to provide for exemptions from planning permission for certain categories of public art murals where such work has artistic or cultural merit, has the permission of the owner of the building or structure on which it is displayed, is not a commercial advertisement and does not conflict with the Equal Status Acts.This will be of great interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. Public art and public art murals make good cities great cities. They enhance not just the physical fabric but the lived experience both of the people who live and work in our cities and those who come to visit. We are genuinely blessed in this country with public art and artists of world standing. Anybody, for example, who knows the work of the artists' collective Subset here in Dublin, including its horse boy mural in the north inner city or its wonderful David Attenborough mural just off South Circular Road, can attest to the great value that good quality public art brings to us. It is a great tragedy that the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, has just left. He is an enormous fan of Asbestos, the public muralist in Cork city, although I understand from recent media coverage that the feeling is not reciprocal for the artist in question, but we will leave that for another day. One of the problems we have at the moment is that the local authority in Dublin city, Dublin City Council, is currently dragging the artists' collective Subset through the courts for alleged planning infringement for the two murals that I mentioned. This is happening at a time when so much of the cultural content is being drained out of Dublin. We have seen the protests around the Cobblestone pub and the attempt by the music community to maintain that hugely important cultural institution. We have seen mobilisations against the kind of speculative-led development and destruction of our urban fabric and daily we see young creatives, artists, musicians and others unable to live in the city because of the absence of social and affordable accommodation. The fact that as all of that is happening, Dublin City Council is taking punitive legal action against some of the country's leading public artists absolutely beggars belief. Having said that, the primary problem is not Dublin City Council. The primary problem is our planning code. Specifically, in respect of the Planning and Development Act and its exemptions, the requirements faced by artists who want to engage in good quality public art and murals are simply too restrictive. In fact, they are even more restrictive than many of the exemptions for commercial products. The Bill I am introducing today, the Public Art Mural (Exempted Development) Bill 2022, seeks to address this legal problem and, in doing so, to support not only our own capital city but cities across the country. The Bill creates a new planning exemption. The idea is very simple. If somebody owns a building and gives consent to artists to provide good quality public art, subject to a number of very reasonable conditions, a planning application is not required. Those reasonable conditions are that the art has cultural and artistic merit, a legal definition that we use elsewhere in our legislative code, such as the legislation underpinning Arts Council grants; is not intended as a commercial or political advertisement or a campaigning tool during an election or referendum period; and does not conflict with the Equality Acts and is not in any way discriminatory, sexist, homophobic, racist and so on. There are some additional protections in terms of special areas of architectural conservation. If this Bill were to pass, it would send a very clear signal from this House to our public artists, some of whom are in the Public Gallery today and I welcome them, that we want high-quality public art to adorn the streetscapes of our cities and towns. It would also ensure that Dublin City Council no longer has to pursue punitive legal action against one of those artists' collectives, Subset, and would allow it to go about its work of enhancing our city unhindered. This is one of those rare occasions where common sense can prevail. Members right across the House can see the sense in this proposal. It would send a really powerful signal to Dublin, our artistic community, residents and visitors that we think public art is a good thing and we think it makes our city better. In Waterford, Barcelona and those parts of Dublin where we have good public art, it brightens up the public space. More than that, it allows us to ask important questions about the world we live in. When public art is at its very best, it is not just beautiful, but thought provoking and life enhancing as well.  I intend to introduce the Bill on Second Stage at the earliest opportunity and invite the Minister of State to actively convince his party colleagues to support it then. If this Bill were to pass unanimously and be enacted, it would demonstrate that the Oireachtas stands squarely with our public artists and stands squarely in favour of improving public space in our cities and towns and crucially, making Dublin not just a good city, but a great city.

A Oirircis, Roberta Metsola, Uachtarán Pharlaimint na hEorpa, thar ceann Chomhaltaí an dá Theach agus thar mo cheann féin, cuirim fáilte romhat chuig an gComhshuí seo de Thithe an Oireachtais. President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, on behalf of the Members of both Houses and on my own behalf I welcome you to this Joint Sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also wish to recognise the Irish MEPs present, the members of the diplomatic corps and, of course, Ms Michelle O’Neill, MLA, who is also with us. President Metsola, merba kbira fil-parlament Irlandi. 
 President Metsola, you are very welcome to the Irish Parliament. We welcome you as the President of the ninth European Parliament - one of the key institutions of our European democratic structure. We salute you also as the third woman to lead that venerable institution, following the exemplary leadership roles of Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine.  Our European Union was founded on the values of peace and democracy. These values have been sorely tested since its foundation. We are now experiencing the greatest test in our lifetimes, with the war in Ukraine. It is almost one year since Russia started this unprovoked and unjustified war. In that time, it has caused inestimable damage to the fabric of Ukraine, which can and will be repaired with global economic support, but it has also caused irreparable damage to the place of Russia in the world and to the Russian people. The European Parliament will play an important role in building and maintaining support for the restoration of Ukraine and its inevitable accession into the Union. The Members of these Houses have had the pleasure of hearing recently from President Zelenskyy, who has become an extraordinary leader for his people, and we, as a people, have done our utmost to support the Ukrainian people and we will continue to do for many years to come.  President Metsola, Ireland has been at the centre of the Union since we signed the Treaty of Accession to join the European Economic Community in 1972 and joined the Community on 1 January 1973. You speak to us today as we are celebrating 50 years in the Union. Membership has been truly transformative for our country. We went from being a small, closed economy and somewhat inward-looking society on the western outskirts of Europe to becoming a larger, ever more open economy with an export-minded and outward-looking people at the social and democratic heart of the Union. Most of the great social changes in Ireland over the past 50 years has been driven by European legislation and values - values which we were proud to willingly embrace. We have a saying in Irish - ní neart go cur le chéile. There is no strength without unity. We are truly stronger together. President Metsola, I invite you now to address these Houses.

Dear Chairs, Taoiseach, Tánaiste, honourable Members of the Oireachtas, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me here today. It is an honour to be in Dublin’s fair city, representing the European Parliament, 50 years after Ireland joined what was then still the European Economic Community. We have come a long way together in five decades. From joining the Single Market to joining the euro, from helping to broker a peace to securing a Northern Ireland protocol. From opportunities to trade, travel and study to working to ensure social justice, respect for the rule of law, fundamental values and rights to live in dignity and safety. These European ideals are Irish values. The EU is not some faraway entity deciding for you. It is you. Ireland is Europe and Europe is Ireland. There is no decision that is taken without you.  Dublin, Cork and Galway are the heart of Europe. When ten people lost their lives in Creeslough, we cried with you. When journalists like Veronica Guerin are killed for speaking up, we share your outrage and your determination for justice. When Ireland faced uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, your position was our position. We went through all of that together and we will stay together. I was told that, 50 years ago, Irish married women were not allowed to work in the public service. It would have seemed inconceivable then that a woman - least of all one born on an island in the middle of Europe’s southern sea - would stand before you here today. That is part of what Europe can do, of how it can be transformational, of how it can be the leveller we need it to be. We have come a long way but there is some way to go yet. Europe is not only about funds for Irish farmers, cohesion, digitalisation, recovery, infrastructure, roads or clean tech. It is about a fundamental understanding that when we do things together, it benefits us all. It is about a shared destiny, a shared future. We have different languages, histories, cultures, traditions, beliefs and abilities but we share common values that are the foundation of everything that we do. The beauty of unity in diversity. That great European Irishman, John Hume, once said:Difference is the essence of humanity. Difference should therefore never be the source of hatred or conflict. Therein lies a most fundamental principle of peace: respect for diversity. Europe is not a homogenous bloc. It does not seek to make everyone the same but it is about trying to ensure equal opportunities, about levelling up, about ending intergenerational cycles of struggle, about the quest for real peace. There are few places in Europe where that message is as important and as well understood as in this great country. For 343 days now, Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of sovereign, independent Ukraine and the bravery of Ukrainian people have reminded us that progress and justice cannot be taken for granted. Democracy cannot be taken for granted. Europe cannot be taken for granted. In the face of destruction, devastation and death, the Irish people continue to show solidarity in helping over 70,000 displaced Ukrainians. Irish people have a long history of showing empathy, of caring, of standing up. For that example to the world, I thank you. Maith sibh. Since the Europe we want for the next 50 years is a Europe that cares, a Europe of real peace and a Europe of justice, we will keep standing with Ukraine in 2023, and for as long as it takes. No country can afford to go it alone. It is only together that we can bring back economic growth and find answers to the questions people ask of us as their representatives. This is also what Ukrainians are asking of us today. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine with financial aid, humanitarian aid and financial assistance, military support and practical solidarity. I thank the Irish across the country for their continued support for the European Parliament's Generators of Hope campaign to source electrical generators that allow essential facilities in Ukraine to keep running, in hospitals, schools, shelters and more. Since this country cares, you have proved that empathy is a sign of strength, time and again. Former US President Barack Obama said it well when he said:Yours is a history frequently marked by the greatest of trials and the deepest of sorrow. But yours is also a history of proud and defiant endurance. Of a nation that kept alive the flame of knowledge in dark ages; that overcame occupation and outlived fallow fields; that triumphed over its Troubles – of a resilient people who beat all the odds.He was right. The story of Ireland is one of beating the odds, struggle, sacrifice, defiance and emerging stronger – lessons that Europe will need to draw on to face the year ahead. Make no mistake, we are living in times of polycrises: war, energy scarcity, electricity prices spiking, cost-of-living increases and inflation wiping value from assets, interest rates impacting government borrowing and housing markets, scarcity of raw materials and a global food shortage one short port blockage away. This is framed in the context of our still-ongoing recovery from the pandemic, the climate emergency and living through increased economic pressure from east and west, which is impacting our competitiveness. This has meant families struggle to stretch their wages to the end of the month. It has meant increased social pressure and people in Europe having to choose between feeding their children and heating their homes. It has meant increased homelessness and hopelessness. The challenges are clear across Europe but I know we can meet this moment head-on. The European Parliament's job is to help to provide the European regulatory framework for the challenges to be met and to show we can save jobs, create new economic niches, modernise and address climate change at the same time. That is what the Next Generation EU funds are about. We need to help our businesses and industries to compete. We can resist the temptation of overprotectionism but they need to have a level playing field, predictability and trust. That is how we can keep attracting investment and industry to Europe. We can learn from Ireland's remarkable macro-economic recovery and how you have managed to deal with the challenges of Brexit. Ireland will have a central role to play in addressing the challenges ahead, all the more so since the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, something the European Union regrets but respects as a democratic choice of a majority of British people. The European Union has not wavered in its solidarity with Ireland, and it is with civility and respect for the rule of law that the European Union and the United Kingdom will pursue their relationship. We will not leave your side. Honourable Members, after 50 years Ireland continues to be an avid European Union team player, supportive of a European Union of values that strives for more equality, justice and care. One day after St. Brigid's Day, there is no doubt in this country that care matters. Healthcare must be accessible to all. During the pandemic, the European Union stepped up and led on healthcare. We were steadfast in securing vaccines and ventilators for all people in all member states. Now we need to go further and create a real health union. That is the best way that we can honour the unsung heroism of front-line workers and caregivers here in Ireland and around Europe. Social justice is high on the agenda of Irish Members of the European Parliament, whom I am happy to see here today. Irish MEPs have led the debate in Europe on mental health, the environment, gender equality, agriculture and farming, fighting domestic violence, femicide and so much more. Ireland has led.  I know the European Parliament has had a difficult few weeks but I am confident that we will fix our systems and rebuild trust. Of course, I would have preferred the world's attention to be on the great work that Members of the Parliament do every day, on the agreements we have reached on climate, migration and asylum, energy, funding and support for Ukraine, and on what we have done to protect the rule of law and strengthen our value-based approach. As your Taoiseach said a few weeks ago, the European project is a superpower of values. We should not forget that. It is important to remind people what Europe is all about and help them to recapture the sense of hope and optimism in our European project. Next year, 2024, the people of Ireland will be called upon to vote for their representatives in the European Parliament. My appeal, to the young Irish in particular, is to choose. Vote. Your vote matters more than you can imagine. Your voice matters more than you know. Europe is not without imperfections or frustrations. I share many of the frustrations. I think we have to be honest about our failings as much as our successes. There is much that we can improve together, and we are determined to do what is necessary. Be part of that conversation; do not give in to the comfort of easy cynicism, peddled by those who say nothing has ever changed. They are wrong. The last 50 years proves that. For Ireland in Europe and for Europe in Ireland, I know the next 50 years will be a remarkable success story – because Ireland is Europe and Europe is Ireland. Thank you.

Ina cáil mar Uachtarán Pharlaimint na hEorpa, is ionadaí chroí daonlathach an Aontais Eorpaigh í. Merba. Grazzi afna. Ireland is marking 50 years of membership of the European Union this year. It has transformed our country and been a powerful engine for economic and social progress. Today, Ireland is a modern, prosperous and progressive country not only as a result of our own efforts, but because of the immense benefits we gained by joining the European Union. It gave us access to EU markets, to funding that helped us to develop our infrastructure and regions and to an agricultural policy through which we became a major food supplier to the world and which helped to sustain our thriving rural communities. Membership of the European Union has amplified our voice in the world. Today, the European Union is a significant global actor with regard to trade, foreign policy and development. It is also a vocal advocate for climate action. We engage with the world on the basis of our shared values, freedom, democracy and human rights, as well as on the basis of our shared interests. One of the most significant achievements of the European Union is the European Single Market, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It gave a great economic boost to the Republic of Ireland, unlocking our prosperity, but also removed border checks and restrictions on trade between North and South. Today, it is easy to take for granted the ability to trade, travel, work and study across the European Union without any barriers. You cannot see what is there any more. However, we need only look to the consequences of Brexit and its effects on the UK's young people to be reminded of how complicated life would be for our citizens and businesses were it not for the four freedoms of the European Single Market. The European Union also provided a space in which peace on this island could be nurtured. It helped remove physical and mental barriers. Differences between North and South, and also between Britain and Ireland, melted away due to EU harmonisation. British and Irish politicians met as equals around the European table and we could more easily see how well aligned, rather than divided, we were on a great many matters, that we had a great deal in common and that there was more uniting us than dividing us. The European Parliament was a place where John Hume and Ian Paisley found common ground. I remember John Hume, that great European, saying how he was inspired by Strasbourg, where the European Parliament sits, in the Alsace region, which has switched between France and Germany throughout history. He asked why, if French and German people who spoke different languages and hurled them at each other through centuries of war could come together through common institutions, the two communities in Northern Ireland, who spoke the same language, could not do the same. The role of the European Parliament continues to this very day through the €1 billion PEACEPLUS programme, which we hope to finalise shortly. This will play a vital role in fostering peace and reconciliation in Ireland, particularly in the Border region. The fact that the President of the Parliament comes from the European Union's smallest member state and a fellow island state is deeply significant for us because we are a union of equals in which the voice of small states really does count. We meet at a time when peace is absent from our Continent. It has been almost a year since Russia launched its brutal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. We are proud to be part of a European Union that stands resolutely with the people of Ukraine. We will stand with them for as long as it takes. We pay tribute to the President's personal leadership and resolve. She was one of the first political leaders to visit Kyiv in an unambiguous demonstration of our commitment to Ukraine and an encouragement to that country on its European path. The European Union is built on strong foundations of shared values and a common purpose. It is rooted in freedom, democracy, the rule of law and a desire for peace. It continues to offer the hope of a better future to millions of fellow Europeans, from Ukraine to Moldova to the western Balkans, many of whom dream of joining the European Union. We should help to make that dream a reality. As the President mentioned earlier, this week we celebrate St. Brigid's Day, Lá Fhéile Bríde, or Imbolc, the Celtic new year, which ushers in a new season of light, hope and growth. It reminds me of her inaugural speech to the European Parliament when she was elected President, in which she committed to standing up for the politics of hope and the promise of the European Union. We will always stand by her in that. Once again, the President is most welcome to Ireland. I thank her for addressing these Houses. Fáilte agus go raibh míle maith agat.

Is pribhléid agus onóir mhór dúinn go bhfuil sí anseo linn ag ceiliúradh 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach ón uair a chaith pobal na tíre seo vóta sa reifreann ar 10 Bealtaine 1972. Táimid fíorbhuíoch den Uachtarán as ucht a ceannaireachta san Eoraip, as a cuid oibre ar fad agus as an tacaíocht leanúnach a thugann sí don tír seo. It was my great honour to address the European Parliament last June. It was a special and moving occasion on which to reflect on our 50 years of membership of the European Union and also to celebrate the life and achievements of the great Irish parliamentarian, peacemaker and committed European, John Hume, whose bust we together unveiled. Like the Parliament over which President Metsola presides, this Parliament stands in full solidarity with Ukraine. Russia's illegal and immoral aggression against its peaceful neighbour represents an horrific and violent assault. The impact on the Ukrainian people has been devastating and truly shocking. When I visited President Zelenskyy in Kyiv in July, I heard first-hand civilian accounts of the brutality and violence visited upon Ukrainian men, women and children by occupying Russian forces. The wanton destruction, including the targeting of nuclear facilities and other energy and civilian infrastructure, shows Putin's Russia behaving as a rogue state. The impact of this aggression has reached far beyond Ukraine. The energy crisis and its impact on the cost of living is as keenly felt in homes and businesses here in Ireland as it is in homes and businesses throughout the European Union. However, in the face of all of this, the support and solidarity of the Irish people has been truly inspirational. In the fact of this destruction and devastation, they have opened their communities, their homes and their hearts to more than 72,000 people who were forced to flee the war. We remain unswerving in our political support for Ukraine and in championing its path towards membership of the European Union. In this Parliament, as in President Metsola's, we have loud debates which include a full range of opinions. However, let there be no doubt about where the Irish people stand with regard to the European Union and our own membership. The Eurobarometer report earlier this year showed that 71% of Irish citizens hold a positive view of the European Union. This is the highest figure recorded and significantly higher than the EU 27 average of 44%. It also found that 88% of Irish citizens were optimistic about the future of the European Union. However, we must never take this support for granted. We must continue to seek and embrace ways to engage citizens, especially our young people, on the aims and benefits of this great Union. We must continue to have a positive agenda of seeking ways to make our Union stronger and more effective. I thank President Metsola for her visit today, for her ongoing solidarity with Ireland and that of her Parliament in respect of Brexit and for her distinguished contribution in shaping the European Union's future. Go raibh míle maith agat.

This period of commemoration allows us to think big for a moment.We have just celebrated our 100th year of the establishment of the State. In listening to President Metsola's words, I was thinking that it was founded on a real desire to stand on our own two feet as a nation, a strong sense of a nationalism, but that it was also imbued with an international perspective, an understanding from the start that our strength would only work within international law. Fifty years ago we learned the lesson that going it alone was not working and we wanted to join the European Union to take a further step in our prosperity, security and culture. We were lucky that the Union allowed us in - not lucky, we added to the Union, bringing neutrality, that still sense of not wanting to be militarily aligned. That was important to the time as something we brought and added to the European Union. There is also what we gained. Strategic decisions at the time to invest in education, back our enterprise and go with the European institutions delivered fantastically for our country. President Metsola mentioned John Hume appropriately. We are approaching the 25-year anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and it is exactly the principle she mentioned, that coercion will not work in our desire for a united Ireland and that respect for diversity is a better way. We changed constitutionally and the vast majority of us voted significantly to take that approach. Now, 25 years on, we need to pause and consider where we are today and where we go for the next 25 and 50 years, recognising that our world is very insecure. Our security in Europe depends on the security of our neighbours in Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans, right the way around. We must recognise also that Europe is at risk. In our economy we are seeing a tendency to import all our software from the United States, all our hardware from Asia and all our energy from Russia and the Gulf. We need to change. President Metsola's address follows not that long after President von der Leyen addressed us. She said that she believes, and I believe the European Parliament thinks the same, that our future is in going green, the Green New Deal. There is the whole swathe of legislation the European Parliament has before it, the Fit for 55 package of legislative measures. I think there are 20 pieces of legislation that we are going to have to agree this year. That allows us to prepare for the future. It allows us to set the standard in aviation, maritime and digital policy where we need to get the constitutional rights of individuals stitched into the economic future. That is the key to success. It allows us restore nature. We have lost half of all wildlife in the last 50 years. Nature here, as across our Union, has been destroyed. Unless we address that, everything will be lost, all the foundations of our prosperity and security will be cut from underneath us. President Metsola's presence today is important and there is important work for us all to do. The constitutional, rule of law system we have is incredibly complicated if we try to explain it, even for those involved in the middle of it. It is this trialogue process where the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, the three legs of representative democratic institutions, have to work together. Let us do that. President Metsola's presence is an important moment at an important time when we have to do that legislative work to create the rule of laws that will provide for people's prosperity. I thank her and her colleagues from the European Parliament who are here today for the work they are doing.

You are very welcome, Madam President. Ireland is a nation that stands proudly for the values of democracy, solidarity, equality and human dignity, for freedom. These are values shared and cherished by the peoples of Europe as we strive to shape a bright future for workers, families and communities in a rapidly changing world. They are of course the values that must drive, reform and recast the European project. I warmly welcome President Metsola today. She visits us when our togetherness and common purpose have never been more important. A year on, Europe remains unified, Ireland also, in our support for the people of Ukraine against Putin's criminal and barbaric invasion. Russia's illegal war and violation of human rights must be stopped and the journey to peace must begin. Putin must withdraw. The Ukrainian people know that they are not alone. They know that Ireland and Europe will stand with them as they continue their struggle for the liberation of their beloved homeland. Some 25 years ago, European solidarity was crucial in the success of our peace process and today Ireland is grateful for the unwavering support of our European partners in the face of Brexit. Europe has stood foursquare in defence of the protocol, hard-won protections for Ireland's peace, political stability and our all-Ireland economy. I acknowledge the repeated support of the European Parliament for the protocol and President Metsola's own staunch commitment, reiterated here today, to protect Ireland's interests in the midst of the Brexit storm. Sinn Féin supports the current talks between the European Union and Britain to make the protocol work better. We need pragmatic and durable solutions and we need them quickly. The people of the North of Ireland want stability and certainty. They want to see the Executive back up and running to deliver for them and their families under the leadership of our colleague, Ms Michelle O'Neill MLA, First Minister designate, who joins us today. We need to see an end to the DUP boycott of the political institutions in the North of Ireland. It has been reported that the mood music from the latest protocol talks is positive. That is most welcome. A fair and practical outcome to these negotiations must be delivered and the time for solutions is now. One of the surest ways of creating change in the world is by speaking honestly with our friends. It is time for the European Union and indeed the wider international community to act forcefully for peace in the Middle East, for an end to Israel's brutalisation of the Palestinians, for an end to the Israeli apartheid regime, a regime that sees annexation and illegal settlements, collective punishment, and the violent targeting of refugees and the dispossessed. In Israeli aggression, Palestinian reprisal, and innocent lives lost in Jenin refugee camp, in Gaza, in synagogues, we see the bitter fruit of the policies of a right-wing, hawkish government. President Metsola rightly reflected earlier on Ireland's colonial experience that shapes our world view. It is in that spirit that I say to her that it is wrong that Israel continues to enjoy a special partnership with the European Union while it tramples on the human rights of Palestinians----

If the European Union is a Union of values, of peace, then the EU must be to the fore in forming a global movement against Israeli apartheid in Palestine with the same international determination and momentum that defeated apartheid in South Africa three decades ago.

President Metsola visits at a time of great change in our country. Ireland has always had the support of our gallant allies in Europe. Europe has kept faith with Ireland and that friendship has meant so very much. We have now had 25 years of peace but we have more to do. Our country remains partitioned but as we walk the final length of our long journey to full nationhood and reunification, I ask our European partners to continue to walk with us. I for one look forward to the day when we see Ireland, our country, in the European Union as a nation united, looking confidently with our European friends to a better future for all our people.

President Metsola is welcome. As Ireland marks 50 years of membership of the European Union, we remember the economic and social progress we have made together but we also recall the hard lessons, particularly from during the economic crash, when serious mistakes were made by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, which we felt here. Thankfully, more recently the positive principles of solidarity and collective action have been central to the European response to the Covid-19 pandemic and Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine. What those crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state and the fact that over-reliance on the market will not solve the complex problems we face. Two immediate and pressing challenges that require a strong European response are the war in Ukraine and the climate catastrophe. First, since Russia's brutal invasion a year ago, we have seen nearly 5 million refugees flee Ukraine. Across the EU we have seen countries acting generously in response. Other wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, combined with the impact of climate change, have led to more people seeking international protection, both here and in other European countries. What we need to see in response is a collective approach at European level to migration policy, one that recognises the benefits of inward migration to our Continent, supports countries in meeting their international obligations and shows what we call céad míle fáilte to those who come here seeking refuge. As we see today, the historic meeting of EU Commissioners in Kyiv is showing welcome solidarity and practical support for Ukraine in terms of accession to the EU, in its rebuilding effort and in seeking to win the war. At that level, I urge that, as part of that solidarity message, we see the introduction of an EU-wide cohesion and integration fund, ring-fenced for supporting countries and communities that are offering a welcome and supports to those fleeing war and persecution. Such a financial programme would have a positive benefit, recognising that people and communities need support for integration. Second, the climate crisis is an existential threat for all of us and we support President von der Leyen's strong leadership on a new green deal at EU level. However, we need to see more accelerated and urgent action. Debates over the proposed energy performance of buildings directive show we still have some way to go, with conservative groupings seeking less ambitious retrofit targets. We also need to see the EU do more to acknowledge the role of air transport in climate change. Like President Metsola's home country of Malta, we too are an island but we have to acknowledge that it is incomprehensible that aviation fuel is not taxed for its carbon emissions. We should see action on this at EU level. As the Labour Party is a member of the second largest grouping in the European Parliament, the Party of European Socialists, PES, we look forward to working le chéile san Eoraip with our sister parties to achieve a more equal Europe, our vision of a social democratic future for all the peoples of our European Continent.

As the Tánaiste said, the Eurobarometer poll earlier this year revealed that 71% of Irish citizens have a positive image of the EU, the highest rating among the member states. If anything, the fallout from Brexit has boosted those favourable views both here and across the EU. I acknowledge the staunch support of our EU partners for the Good Friday Agreement and the clear commitment that there will never be a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. We remain hopeful that a fair compromise is imminent on the Northern Ireland protocol. What is important is that when a deal comes the Good Friday Agreement, which has protected peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland since it was agreed almost 25 years ago, is defended and respected. We want to see the functioning institutions restored in Northern Ireland. While there is undoubtedly an overwhelmingly positive attitude to the EU in Ireland, there are also concerns about certain policy choices. The EU should be about the social Europe first and the economic Europe second. The fiscal rules, for example, need reform. One size does not fit all. For example, Ireland needs the freedom to deal with infrastructural deficits, climate change and our housing crisis, while maintaining fiscal stability. I also want to raise the prosecution of an Irishman, Seán Binder, in Greece for the alleged crime of plucking drowning migrants from the sea. In January, some of the charges against Seán and other humanitarian workers were dropped but felony charges, including for people smuggling, remain. Such prosecutions are an attack on the core values of the EU, including human dignity, equality, human rights and the rule of law. Another attack on the EU institutions is on trust in the EU by way of corruption, to which President Metsola alluded. Allegations that countries such as Qatar and Morocco have bought influence at the highest political level of the European Parliament were deeply shocking. The European Parliament has so far dealt with this scandal firmly and has lifted diplomatic immunity so that MEPs can be criminally investigated. Corruption, if it is found to exist, will rot the institutions from the inside out and must be excised from the roots. When the criminal investigation is over and if allegations against MEPs and lobbyists are proven, a serious review of existing anti-corruption measures in the EU institutions will be required. I am sure President Metsola will have the full support of this country for any such review. I also reiterate our full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and condemn the brutal invasion of a sovereign state.

I welcome her commitment to supporting continued peace on this island and to preventing any return to a hard border in this country. I also welcome her comments about the need to address the cost-of-living and housing crises that are gripping Europe and significantly impacting this country. I have to say, however, that it is long past time the European institutions acknowledged the role they played, particularly in response to the economic crisis after 2008 and the decision of the Troika to impose swingeing, cruel and brutal austerity in this country. That is not an historical matter and it has left us with a dire and cruel housing crisis that is inflicting utter misery on record numbers of people in homeless accommodation and tens of thousands of people who are affected by the lack of affordable and public housing. Europe has a great responsibility for the decisions it made in that regard, which also affected the crisis that continues to grip our health service as we were forced to cull thousands of health workers. That has left us a grim legacy in our health services, which are overrun. I also want to question the assertion President Metsola made about "a superpower of values" and principles. She rightly condemns Vladimir Putin's brutal and invasion of and inexcusable and criminal warmongering in Ukraine, but fails at the same time to condemn the crimes against humanity and the apartheid system that Israel is perpetrating against the Palestinian people, as was recently publicised by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. When she went to the Knesset in May last year she did not say a word about the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and did not condemn the apartheid regime. The European Union does not call for sanctions in the way it has called for them against Russia.It is does not assert the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's right to resist an illegal occupation of their land and territory and the criminal apartheid regime that is imposed on them. Those double standards cannot stand. That is not a superpower of principles but one of double standards. Ms Metsola will know that six MEPs from the parliament of which she is president were denied access to go in to monitor the crimes of Israel against the Palestinian people. The humans rights organisations in Palestine wrote to her asking her to speak out against that, which she has failed to do. We need consistency and real principles when it comes to these matters.

Tá súil againn go mbeidh an t-am a chaitheann sí anseo ina chabhair agus ina ábhar eolais di. Tá súil againn freisin go mbainfidh sí taitneamh as a cuairt go hÉirinn inniu. It is a remarkable feature of our politics that I have the opportunity to address the President of the EU Parliament on the occasion of Ireland's 50th year at the heart of the European project. Three years ago, I entered politics principally out of frustration at the lack of a 24-7 emergency cardiac service for County Waterford and, more generally, unequal access to healthcare and education in the region. Everyone in the room will appreciate how swiftly I worked in my parish concerns there. The warm welcome offered to the president today needs to be compared to the contested ground of the céad míle fáilte that Ireland currently musters for refugees. Irish people know that migration is a long term and often forever entanglement. The kindness and decency of the welcome matters. There can be no second-class citizens in a republic, even in our flawed Republic. Yet, we are now at risk of emulating the cold house of our English neighbours offered to Irish labourers in the 1950s, or the sentiment there delivering unconscionable treatment to the Windrush generation, in addition to their explicitly hostile environment for migrants. Irish people value a warm welcome but the ability of our politics and that of the EU to deliver one is now an open question. Ireland can certainly afford a dignified reception. This week's GDP numbers show that the calibre of the welcome relates to the Government's capability rather than resources. The EU can also afford a warm house and a warm welcome. Ms Metsola, in her address on her election as president, affirmed a commitment to European values of dignity, solidarity and fundamental rights. Will our politics and governance allow us to live these values? Are we capable of ensuring that no more people meet the same fate as Alan Kurdi in the Mediterranean? It is profoundly a question of capability. Realistically, in Ireland, it is a question of solving the housing crisis and the broader challenge of raising the capacity and the quality of government services. Our politics is tired and weary from permanent polycrises, including the bailout, the pandemic, housing, health and the energy crisis. The cost of failure to deliver is that we allow our values slip. If that happens, we will be diminished as a people. We will be known not for our welcome but our inability to welcome those who throw in their lot with ours.

I also say to her that we have had benefits from the EU. We have also inherited many problems. Mention has been made of housing and the troika and the damage they left behind. A trail of terror has been blazed by vulture funds and the banks in this country on ordinary householders and small businesses. We also have the situation regarding the Paris Agreement green deal of 2015, which is outdated at this stage. It is a goal we cannot continue with because it is putting penury and misery on ordinary people. We see countries such as China, India and Germany opening dirty coal mines at the moment, while we are taking all these measures at the behest of this agreement. I am not against climate change.

We have sniggers and insults across the floor. It is disgusting behaviour that has crept in from those who will not tolerate anything. A situation is also being forced on us in respect of the refugee crisis. We are "Ireland of the thousand welcomes", of course, but the problem is the management of that welcome and of inward migration, and the undocumented people who have arrived here. There is a lack of both information and a cohesive plan. We saw it in Lismore this week and it could be in the town of Cahir, where I live, next week, where rumour emerges. I have spoken about it to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who is doing his best, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. We need planning. We do not have the hospital services, again thanks to the troika and the banking collapse. We do not have the teaching capability or the services in place. We are foisting people on communities with no information, no proper truth and no proper debate. That is not a good situation. We want to welcome. We want to be able to say, "Ní neart go cur le chéile", as the Ceann Comhairle said, but we want to do so positively and together. We want to be able to debate the policy in this House. We have not had that debate for the past year. We will have statements next week, thankfully, when we will have some modicum of debate. All is not well in our little country. Europe has been good to us. We are celebrating 50 years in the EU but its policies are affecting the sale of portions of Coillte. European rules will not allow Coillte to avail of grants. This must be re-examined. The policies are too rigid to allow our economy to thrive. For our people to survive and be the vibrant people they are, we need better understanding from Europe for us.

As a former MEP, I remember her when she was also an MEP, in particular in her role as vice chair of the petitions committee, where many petitioners from across Europe, including Ireland, came to make their case. I remember her humane approach and consideration, which was appreciated. However, we did not always agree politically. As a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, which is now the Renew Europe group, I remember we were sometimes on different sides of the argument. In a way, I see that as part of the strength of the European Parliament in that there is no in-built majority. Many majorities are constructed around specific issues and legislation. That allows MEPs from groups, large and small, to influence outcomes through compromise amendments at committee and plenary sessions. That strengthens the legitimacy of the democratic workings of the Parliament and helps to ensure that diverse voices can be heard. I commend the European Parliament on its steadfast support for Ireland throughout the entire Brexit process and its support for Ukraine as Russia targets its citizens and homeland. I agree with the President that the parliament is most certainly not without its failings. Her challenge is to minimise those, strengthen links to citizens and rebuild trust. As we celebrate 50 years of membership of the EU, I wish her well.

The most recent president we were blessed with was the President of the Commission where, arguably, all the power lies, the members of which are all unelected bureaucrats. Not to be undone, and to give the impression that the EU is a democratic organisation, a democratically elected member of the parliament is present today. The purpose of today's visit is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of our membership of the EU. It would be nice to have Europeans here thanking us for our total contribution of fish to the EU, which far outweighs any help in terms of the value of moneys we have received from Europe since we joined. Acknowledging that we have been hoodwinked over the years, even to this day, when France, Spain, Belgium and a host of other EU countries have more entitlement to our fish stocks than we have, would be welcome and would at least make us believe that the EU is interested in what we have to say. Of course, the EU has always had plenty of our ruling parties to help it along the way.We are guilty of assisting in our own denigration unfortunately. Our ruling parties are going to happily get rid of our neutrality in the coming years and we will become an integral part of the European empire. I wonder what the European Parliament has to say about that but then the European Parliament will not have a role in defence. That will be left totally to the unelected Commission which is only required to inform the Parliament that it is going to war. It is also interesting that President Metsola is from another neutral member state of the Union. I hope it is not in name only. Does the Government of Malta carry on in the same way as the Irish Government and happily undermine neutrality at every opportunity? Perhaps the Maltese Government has more backbone and will defend what its citizens believe.

I speak as an Independent Senator representing the graduates of Trinity College Dublin. I also speak as a veteran of Ireland's Armed Forces and a veteran of conflict in the Middle East, a person who has witnessed at first hand the squalor and indiscriminate savagery of war in the Middle East. War such as that in Ukraine today kills innocent men and women and murders children. I commend the support our European Union has given to Ukraine, including the moral support, financial support and, yes, the supply of weapons and armaments that Ukraine may defend itself against Vladimir Putin's aggression. Today I make this plea to President Metsola, as a veteran and a parent of teenagers and young adults, please, we need to invest as much energy in ending this war as we do in tanks, air defence systems, fighter aircraft or longer range missiles. Putin and his henchmen-and henchwomen have shown a complete disregard for the international laws of conflict. Putin has shown complete disregard for logic and a complete disregard for human life. Tens of thousands of young Ukrainian soldiers and thousands of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children have been sacrificed on the altar of his fragile ego and brittle patriarchal ambition as have tens of thousands of young Russian men from the poorest republics in the Russian Federation. And for what? A vanity project at the behest of the world's richest oligarchs. As spring approaches we risk escalation in this war. I have no doubt that Putin and his newly appointed General Gerasimov, architect of the infamous Gerasimov doctrine, is capable of deploying a so-called tactical nuclear weapon, or mini nuke, in Ukraine. That would signal the beginning of a wider and cataclysmic conflict. There is a saying in Russian, prodolzheniye sleduyet, and there is also a saying in Ireland when people ask for directions, "I would not start here" but here we are. The direction I ask from President Metsola and from the European Parliament is to find the pathway to peace, to leave no stone unturned and to bring an end and a just resolution to the war. The most powerful weapon we can give Ukraine in this conflict is full membership of our European Union. We need to accelerate this because our values and prosperity represent the most powerful challenge to tyranny. Putin and his cronies will not be here forever. Ukraine will. Likewise will the European Union and the people of Russia. Let us find a pathway to peace through our European Union. It is not a military union but a social and economic union. Let us not forget it is the greatest peace process in human history and long may it continue.

One of the reasons for the positive views of so many members of the Irish public towards that project has been the role that the European Union has historically played in supporting progress on environmental protection, workers' rights and gender equality, from the ending of the marriage bar and the introduction of the working time directive to the important affirmation of women's access to bodily autonomy, safety and reproduction rights, which are also reflected in our recent referendum, and the very welcome European Parliament vote today in favour of a strong directive on the rights of platform workers. We cannot be complacent on either values or rights as they can be eroded as well as progressed. When it comes to the crucial issue of migrant rights the European Parliament has had moments of leadership, voting for the activation of the temporary protection directive for Ukrainians and a noble attempt to activate that protective directive in respect of Syrian refugees in 2015. There have been moments of retreat from rights, in the shameful failure to support search and rescue in the Mediterranean and the funding of walls with Syria. President Metsola spoke about real peace and it is very important. Europe is a peace project. It is not just security. Sometimes security and peace work in different directions. Real peace comes from longer and deeper work and investment in communities and cohesion. There are the particular contributions of neutral countries such as Malta and Ireland in the important international work of disarmament, which contribute to all of our security and peace in this world, and in the application and championing of international law wherever it is breached. It is extremely welcome that European countries have been strong and clear in their support of international law, human rights and humanitarian support for Ukraine but clear and strong positions are also needed elsewhere. The EU should not be allowing, let alone defending in the courts, trade in goods from occupied territories, be they in Palestine or Western Sahara. The targeting of front-line human rights defenders, journalists or civilians, and I know these are issues President Metsola cares about, are issues wherever they occur, including, as we have seen recently, in the Middle East. President Metsola spoke about healthcare. When we talk of EU values if they are really values we should be wishing them for everyone. Values such as healthcare are important. The European Parliament took a position in support of a TRIPS waiver. This was important because it was an example of how parliamentarians can reflect the decency and solidarity of citizens rather than prioritising the profits of a few companies. It is to be hoped this will be reflected in the corporate sustainability due diligence directive. I am coming to the end of my time. I was to speak on the future of Europe and I know President Metsola has a record in a former future of Europe process. The Parliament can speak to institutions and remind them that our mandate comes from the public of Europe; not from lobbyists or small interests but from the public. We can avoid the mistakes of austerity and build a Europe that genuinely cares and is social.

Members of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann, it is my pleasure to welcome President Metsola and thank her for her support and friendship to us as a democracy and a nation. The European Parliament represents the second largest electorate in the world. The people of Ireland value being part of that electorate. For 50 years since 1973, 50 bliain ag fás, we have benefited from economic and developmental opportunities. More than this, our membership of the European Union enables us to stand with the hundreds of millions of Europeans who share our commitment to democracy and peace. President Metsola, today your address was both honest, challenging and sobering and we thank you for that. Tá seanfhocal sa Gaeilge agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an ceann céanna sa Mháltais. There is a saying in Irish, and I think a very similar one in your own language: Tagann an ghrian i ndiaidh na fearthainne - the sun follows after the rain. These are challenging times, as many of our speakers today have said, in our region and they demand a strong European Union. As President of the European Parliament you have shown your commitment to lead, renew and strengthen Europe in preparation for brighter days ahead. We thank you for your leadership, your presence and your visit to us today, which we see as a sign of Europe’s continued commitment to Ireland as well as Ireland’s continued commitment to Europe, as you have said. Your visit comes, as we spoke of at lunch, after an ancient Gaelic festival called Imbolc. For Christians, it is the feast day of St. Brigid and traditionally observed on the first day of February. Imbolc marks the beginning of spring, a time of renewal and a time of hope. I mention this today as a reminder to all of us that Europe, as a project of peace, has hope at its centre. In your role as President of the European Parliament you have been an agent of that hope. Your presidency has been simultaneous with the unjust war in Ukraine and you have met this challenge by demonstrating that Europe's strength lies in solidarity and unity. Ireland is proud to be represented in the European Parliament that is a beacon of hope for Ukraine and a driver of positive change in Europe and the world. I welcome today to our joint sitting members of the European Parliament who are here. I see former Senator, Deputy and Minister, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, Maria Walsh MEP, Deirdre Clune MEP and former MEP Gay Mitchell. You are very welcome. I want to welcome Michelle O'Neill to our sitting today and thank her for your leadership as well. A Uachtaráin, thank you for being here today. You went to Kyiv at a time when leadership was needed. You have demonstrated again that you are preparing for that brighter day. We wish you a very positive visit to our country. We thank you for your support. Go raibh míle maith agat.

There are many instances where discretion is needed. We should not be over-prescriptive in a lot of areas but this is not one of them. It is unfair not to be clear with the Garda in this regard. This goes back to my point about the absence of a central piece in this legislation. Section 11(1) provides that a person will be guilty of an offence if he or she falsely conceals, destroys or in other ways gets rid of information gathered by a recording device. However, it is silent in regards to someone turning off a device to ensure the information does not exist in the first place. This is a far easier option for anyone seeking to conceal behaviour. It is important we look at this from both sides. The vast majority of gardaí will be absolutely compliant but it only takes a small number to bring the force into disrepute. This again comes down to the need to have more detail about the use of these technologies written into the legislation, rather than codes of practice which are not legally enforceable to the same degree. I understand these sorts of technologies seem like an incredibly useful tool in policing but the reality is far more complicated than the producers of some of these technologies would have us believe. There is no conclusive evidence that body-worn cameras improve safety for police officers. There have been many studies around the world on these cameras and any metadata analysis which has taken place has not found any statistically significant changes. It is important that we protect our police force in taking on the challenges they must sometimes face. I reinforce the point that this is not a case of resisting something that could protect people who are doing a very dangerous job. Some of them are my neighbours and others are the sons and daughters of my friends. I am acutely aware we have to protect people on both sides. It may well be the case that cameras give a feeling of safety and their use may not be backed up by evidence. Gardaí should feel as safe and protected as possible in doing their work. They face incredible risk while doing vital work to protect our communities but they deserve more than the illusion of safety. It is not clear that body cameras provide any more than that. Much more research is needed before we enact a programme of introducing body cameras across the whole Garda force. It would make far more sense to operate a pilot programme to ensure the cameras will be effective in achieving what we want them to achieve. We also need to stack this up against the infringement of privacy rights of individuals who will be filmed by gardaí as they are minding their own business walking past officers on the street. While that may well not be the way this technology is to be used, it will be especially significant if real-time facial recognition technology could be used in these body cameras. That is one of the central points I want to make. To be clear about what real-time facial recognition systems entail, most of them follow a similar pattern. Using artificial intelligence, AI, the system detects the presence of a face within an image. The system will then analyse the detected face and create a number of relevant data points used to identify one person from another. Then the system will compare those data points against pre-existing records and should, in theory at any rate, be able to recognise the person in the frame. Imagine for a second the number of faces a system operating on a CCTV camera on Grafton Street would scan and the number of data points it would collect in order to find the person being sought. To start with, there would need to be a significantly large database to create and store these highly sensitive data from innocent people who are of no interest to the Garda and who would be passively surveilled without their knowledge.The sheer number of security breaches in Government Departments over the past few years should be enough to give us significant pause for thought. I feel like I am talking in a vacuum about this legislation because this central piece is so absent that it is very difficult to imagine what is proposed. I am probably looking at worst-case scenarios but I do not know what the Minister is bringing forward.

It has unresolved issues regarding the use of CCTV, automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, drones and body cameras. There are also Data Protection Commission, DPC, investigations outstanding. The Garda does not have adequate data protection systems in place for the data it currently possesses. This Bill would mean that the force would be required to process multiples of the data it currently collects. In addition, facial recognition technology is not effective. It is well documented that it produces false results wrongly identifying suspects. This is important. Let us look at what is happening elsewhere. A study of the London police in 2019 found that in 81% of cases facial recognition technology identified the wrong person. It was particularly weak in identifying the faces of anyone who is not a white male. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has warned that facial recognition disproportionately flags ethnic minorities, women and disabled people, prompting concerns that it will exacerbate social inequality. I would have thought it would be critical to look at this aspect before facial recognition technology is used. The definition of "recording devices" in the Bill has been left intentionally broad by the Department. I know there is an element of future-proofing with technologies. Things have been invented in the last five years that 20 years ago we could not even have thought of. I accept, therefore, that there is future-proofing, but not all future technologies should be used for policing purposes. I cannot say what these are and nor can the Minister because we do not know what is going to be invented. The generality of this section is concerning, including regarding the ethics and accuracy of the devices we currently have. We have no idea what future concerns there will be about future technologies. Potentially, there are major problems when issuing a blank cheque concerning future technologies. There must be some ongoing review of what might be used and what protections need to be in place. In its submission to pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation, the Policing Authority cautioned that the use of new technologies should not be automatically assumed to be unquestionably good or a panacea for every problem. The use of each type of recording device and specific technology needs to be evaluated individually. Each has specific aspects, and there will be a different degree of risk depending on what the device is intended to be used for. We must give consideration to both sides of this issue and to proportionality. Let us take drone technology as an example. These would be covered under the definition of "recording devices" in this Bill. The Article 29 working group on data protection has already examined the use of drones for law enforcement and concluded that their use for surveillance should require a higher level of approval and the data processed should be further scrutinised by a human operator. Too much is simply being left unsaid in this Bill. It is unacceptable to not have sight of the proposals. I have made this point several times in my contributions, particularly regarding facial recognition technology. It is unacceptable to leave so many of the vital aspects of this Bill up to the codes of practice and not subject to Oireachtas oversight. Speaking before me yesterday, my colleague from Kildare North, Deputy Patricia Ryan, referred to the number of gardaí per head of population. It is way below the national average in counties Kildare and Meath. In some cases, this figure stands at half of that average. This is partly to do with the continuous growth of population in these counties. I imagine that Fingal is probably a little similar.

County Kildare doubled its population between 1971 and 1995 and it has since doubled its population again. The Minister will know from his constituency that the services do not match the growth in population. The number of gardaí is a case in point in this regard. This matters for the kind of policing we get. We get more reactive policing because there is simply no time for gardaí to go into schools or for community gardaí. For years, Kildare was the only county that did not have even one community garda. One of my concerns, which I have expressed several times, is risk for members of the Garda. For members to respond to call-outs on their own is high risk. No body camera is going to protect that person. I refer to not having enough gardaí in a location to respond to serious calls. We have seen this in a high profile case where a garda, unfortunately, lost his life when he was responding on his own. I think that happened in County Louth. We must look at where these risks are and they must be mitigated. We cannot view one approach as a solution in respect of making things safer for gardaí. A multiplicity of things will be required. I would have said that the inadequate number of people to respond is a bigger risk than identifying individuals by digital devices or whatever. I ask the Minister to take this point seriously. We are told constantly that resources are down to the Garda Commissioner and the issue has nothing to do with the Oireachtas. It does, however, if there is not a fair distribution. I must be going on about this for 20 years. I have met Garda Commissioners and assistant commissioners and made submissions. I know others have done exactly the same. This issue must be addressed because we cannot grow a population without growing the resources to go with it. Otherwise, we are only creating problems.

An Garda Síochána plays such a vital role in all our communities and in society. Its members are those on the front lines who protect us every day, keep our people safe and serve our communities. In recent weeks, however, we have seen some serious incidents where gardaí have been seriously injured. We must address this issue in the Oireachtas and condemn such actions. In modern society, fully digitalised systems need to be incorporated. It is crucially important that An Garda Síochána has access to the latest technologies to counter such challenges. Across all EU member states and globally, we see that modern police services must adapt and be up-to-date regarding their digital tools and technologies to keep our communities safe and to protect citizens and themselves. The principal objective in this Bill is to provide such tools to An Garda Síochána. I will touch first on the pros of the Bill. Deploying body-worn cameras will certainly improve the accurate recording of incidents, allow for the prosecution of offenders and protect Garda officers from assault. These are certainly benefits. Not only will this benefit gardaí, but civilians may also be protected from Garda misconduct, which cannot be forgotten. I support the inclusion of the amendments brought forward by the Minister, one such being the use of facial recognition technology, to improve this Bill. Before its introduction, however, I ask that all data protection impact assessments and human rights assessments be carefully considered and thoroughly investigated.I note the points made previously by Members in this House that facial recognition technology can lead to mass monitoring and profiling and unintended consequences around surveillance. We should in no shape or form be using it to racially profile any member of the public. Through those assessments and studies, we will have a better picture of its introduction. The second point is around the violation of rights. We must enforce strict guidelines for gardaí when they are routinely collecting, retaining, storing and searching through the tremendous amount of personal data of members of the public they will have at their discretion. We certainly do not want to utilise this technology inappropriately, which may put our people's rights at risk. That is an important element. If the facial recognition technology ends up being approved, our right to privacy must be protected. Our rights to free assembly and association and the right to equality and non-discrimination must also be protected. There is still a high degree of discretion left to the codes and practices so we should be more transparent around how the Garda will use these body-worn cameras. We require a statutory code of practice to set the standards for the use of these body-worn cameras. The third point is the ambiguity of the recording devices. We should be more specific about the term "recording devices" and the types of devices we will use. It is quite ambiguous. While body cameras have been specified, the recording devices have not been distinguished. These devices can range from tablets to mobile phones to drones. While additional emerging technology may be highly utilised or may provide more beneficial effect to the Garda force, these technologies can simultaneously pose a threat of significant human rights violations. A drone, for example, poses significant privacy risks since we cannot be certain about what data are being collected, who is collecting them or the data processing procedure around that type of technology. The fourth point is about public concern. The public are concerned that body-worn cameras may add an unfair bias to a garda's version of events due to the camera being under the exclusive control of the garda. That is an important point. We must reinforce the point that fully trained and qualified gardaí will be utilising the cameras effectively and appropriately, and in a transparent manner in the way the data will be processed. The Bill must facilitate a human rights impact assessment, as I said previously, around data protection. This type of technology is relatively new and therefore the research in this area is still a developing field. We must be mindful of that. We should not automatically assume the new technology will only contribute positively to policing or justice issues. We must be meticulous about the enforcement of body-worn cameras and we must be very detailed about the access to these devices and the manner in which they will be used.

Moves in the direction of using body camera technology can be of benefit to both the public and the Garda, so long as gardaí receive sufficient training and so long as data are treated sensitively and protected. I echo the points made by Deputy Catherine Murphy about the lack of detail. It is quite difficult to engage where there is that lack of detail. Body camera and dashcam technology have been used in many police services across the European Union and beyond for some time. The appropriate use of such technology would be welcome during the course of policing in this State - that is a fact - but we have to learn the lessons from other jurisdictions and learn where there have been difficulties. This is something the Garda wants and something it is now going to get, which is welcome, but we would be foolish if we were to say it is not something that is without problems. We know there are problems with the use of this technology. Not only will the footage act as a deterrent for those wishing to assault or intimidate gardaí during the course of their work but it will also help to capture evidence of crimes in real time, as well as help when witnesses may have to come into court to support the evidence. That might be lessened. It would be good if some of the burden could be taken off witnesses and if we could do something that would avoid them being retraumatised, or diminish that. However, it goes without saying that body cameras can also offer additional protection to those engaging with gardaí. The Garda itself has acknowledged this. Let us not pretend they will not provide this dual function. They will be a form of protection for An Garda Síochána but they will also be a form of protection for people engaging with members of An Garda Síochána. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has outlined concerns related to an infringement of the right to privacy and has highlighted the broad definition of recording devices, as outlined previously. It has suggested they could be used for covert recording. While it has been stated that body cameras will not be used for covert surveillance, the legislation could still be used to do this due to the broad definitions in the Bill. Only a change to the legislation by way of amendment will truly resolve this. Recording devices will not address the core failure in terms of the ability of An Garda Síochána to police and do its job effectively and that is the lack of garda numbers. In Dublin, for example, there are 18% fewer members of An Garda Síochána than there were in 2009, despite substantial population growth in the city and county. Everyone deserves to be safe in their community and to know that their local gardaí have sufficient resources and staffing levels to protect them. Many gardaí working overtime are doing so to cover policing duties that other stations are unable to meet due to a nationwide shortage. I have deep concerns with regard to racial profiling and the use of facial recognition technology. That is not just my concern; those concerns are shared by human rights organisations. The evidence of that happening is available internationally. We do not need to reinvent any wheels. We simply need to look at where this technology has been used and failed and not repeat those mistakes.

We are opposed to any attempt to use the current crises, including the growth of quite horrifying anti-refugee protests, influenced by racist and far-right ideas, as an excuse to add another layer to the powers and scope of policing in this State. I listened to the Minister and most of the Opposition speakers express broad support for the Bill. That was generally couched in terms of how transformative this new technology can be in freeing up gardaí, saving thousands of hours of Garda time and revolutionising policing. We should be clear and honest that body cameras, greater use of drone footage, CCTV or especially facial recognition technology will not do any of those things. They will not revolutionise policing for the better. I can predict very confidently that if this Bill is passed, we will still be back here in the same sort of position in two or three years' time with another list of requests for greater powers, laws and resources and with the same promise that it is only with these ones that we will actually be able to change the game and have an impact on crime and so on. It is the rhetoric we always hear about extra powers being given and new laws on special criminal courts, public order Acts, etc. In this case, the promise is that technology will save us, if only we use it. There is no evidence for that. In fact, and particularly for facial recognition technology, it comes with very significant question marks over it and very significant problems from international evidence. There is a growing worldwide movement that is resisting it and pointing out the harm and damage that can result from it. We have the benefit of being able to look and learn from other states before we make this very retrograde and disastrous move.It is shocking that the Minister, and in particular the Green Party, seem determined to ignore the evidence of the harm that this can do. It is extraordinary that we are told the Minister will bring an amendment on Committee Stage to facilitate facial recognition technology, therefore avoiding any real pre-legislative scrutiny of such a major change and development because it comes in at such a late stage. The ICCL has pointed out that neither facial recognition technology nor ANPR were in the general scheme of the Bill and, as such, were not subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny. I want to comment in more detail on the proposed amendments the Minister says he will introduce on facial recognition technology. I will refer at some length to the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, on this. It has experience of facial recognition technology and a very strong attitude to it. It says these technologies threaten our privacy and free speech rights. It also says that when they are used by police and immigration enforcement, they serve as yet another dangerous system to abuse black and brown people on a massive scale. The ACLU says big tech companies are profiting from these abuses because they are the ones developing and selling facial recognition to Government agencies. It also states that it is their communities, in particular communities of colour, that face the harmful consequences. The union maintains that it knows first-hand how tech companies collaborate with immigration and law enforcement agencies to build large-scale surveillance tools that facilitate and fuel racist systems that harm both immigrants and US citizens. The ACLU believes facial recognition technology is racist from how it was built to how it is used. It states that it has been used by police departments to wrongfully arrest black men by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection, CBP; to target and track immigrant families; and by the FBI to surveil Black Lives Matter demonstrators exercising their first amendment rights. The ACLU maintains that facial recognition massively expands the government's power to track movements and target people based on their race, religion, political affiliation or speech. It suggests that while everyone's rights are at stake, black and brown people are harmed the most when this racist technology collides with our racist systems. In the words of Amnesty International: ...facial recognition risks being weaponized by law enforcement against marginalized communities around the world. From New Delhi to New York, this invasive technology turns our identities against us and undermines human rights. The ICCL points out in its briefing that in Belgium, Luxembourg and Morocco, facial recognition technology is banned or greatly restricted. In the US, cities that have banned police use of facial recognition technology include Boston, Oakland, Portland and San Francisco. In the UK, huge questions have emerged about the accuracy of the technology, with studies in some cities suggesting 80% inaccuracy in the application of facial recognition technologies. Given all of this, the Minister's unquestioning support for it is baffling. We agree with the ICCL statement that facial recognition technology has no place in Irish policing. Despite this, we are told that this technology will save us. It is particularly ironic that it is touted as some sort of response to racist and far-right attacks on refugees, when globally it is recognised as contributing to racist policing and the targeting of vulnerable minorities. I am not reassured by bland guarantees of oversight and safeguards because the truth is we have a consistent problem with holding gardaí in this State to account. I remember the late Dara Quigley, who was an articulate, powerful writer and campaigner on many issues. I worked alongside her in particular on water charges. The sharing of her image by the Garda when she was in a clearly distressed state has never been properly investigated nor anyone held to account. Similarly, the history of GSOC investigating abuses and errors in policing in this State does not inspire confidence in any oversight or accountability when this new technology is rolled out. Given the body of evidence globally on facial recognition technology, how it is being misused and abused, how inaccurate it is and how it seems to be pushed by big tech companies in their own interests, it is unconscionable that the Green Party in particular, which has an on-paper commitment to civil liberties, can support this. If Green Party Members had any principles left, they would oppose it and refuse to support any amendment that the Minister brings to facilitate this. The real problems communities face, such as antisocial activity, drug crimes and violence against persons, in particular against women, cannot be addressed solely by a policing response, and they cannot be addressed by some magic new technology. For that reason, we will not support the Bill.

This positive and proactive legislation will improve not only how we tackle and prevent crime but also how we protect members of An Garda Síochána as they work to keep us and our streets safe. I know there has been discussion and criticism of some parts of the Bill. I refer in particular to the potential implications for privacy and civil liberties. I very much welcome the open discussion, which it is important to have. I also welcome the consultation that took place when drafting this legislation with groups such as the ICCL, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA. While it is vital that we make full use of new and emerging technologies and systems that have yielded good results in other jurisdictions, it is critical that we do it in a way that acknowledges the data-driven world we live in. We live in a world where people's private data are a hot commodity. That is the reason they must be treated with a massive amount of respect. I am very reassured by the safeguards that have been baked into this legislation that address many of those concerns. An important part of the legislation is the provision to place a statutory obligation on the Garda Commissioner to prepare codes of practice around the use of CCTV and recording devices. The codes of practice will require the approval of the Minister for Justice. I understand that work is already under way on these codes and that they will ensure strict standards are applied around confidentiality, security, storage, access and retention of data. It must be said that trust in An Garda Síochána is extremely high among Irish people. An Amárach Research survey published last year found that 81% of people had trust in the Garda. We have very high levels of positive public engagement. That is because the Garda do brilliant work, often in massively challenging and difficult circumstances. The results of public attitude surveys certainly ring true when I speak to people on the ground in my area in Lucan, Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas. Their experience of dealing with the Garda is overwhelmingly positive. Giving gardaí the tools to better investigate and detect criminality will only improve that relationship further. Those tools will allow for recording by body-worn cameras, helicopters, aircraft, Garda dogs, drones, mobile devices and tablets. They will also extend the powers governing Garda use of CCTV and ANPR technology to help to prevent crime and to prosecute those involved in criminal activity. Providing powers for An Garda Síochána to access third-party CCTV on a live-feed basis will support the Garda in carrying out its functions and will be subject to strict guidelines and oversight. CCTV is often raised with me by constituents. People feel it could be better used to combat illegal dumping, fly-tipping and antisocial behaviour. Therefore, it is positive that CCTV and camera footage will now be more widely used by An Garda Síochána, and used in a way that does not place anyone's personal data or privacy in harm's way. I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill. It is positive, proactive and it will improve how we tackle and prevent crime. Critically, it will also improve how we protect members of An Garda Síochána, as they protect us.

Providing our police service with the use of body-worn cameras for gardaí and the expanded use of ANPR technology assists in obtaining the right perspective. Body-worn cameras are widely used across the EU as an effective tool for evidence-gathering in the investigation of crime. I join my colleagues in Fianna Fáil in condemning in the strongest possible way attacks made on a member of An Garda Síochána. It is important that they, and other front-line workers, are protected when carrying out their duties. There is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against gardaí. Attacking a member of An Garda Síochána carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and assault causing harm carries a maximum life sentence. However, criminal legislation is kept under review and the Government is committed to taking further action to protect gardaí and front-line workers, as necessary.It is welcome that the Government will also enact the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 this year, which will increase the maximum penalty available for the offence of assault causing harm, from five years' imprisonment to ten. I very much welcome that. We have a long, proud history of policing with co-operation and anything that assists that is welcome. I have, however, one concern. A critical component on the use of facial recognition technology remains unpublished. Does the Minister intend to advance the proposal on Committee Stage and will this allow sufficient time for detailed scrutiny that the use of this technology demands? I have concerns about that, as other speakers have expressed. Everybody has a right to privacy. I will firmly support this Bill. My son and son-in-law are gardaí. I know the work they do. I can only say they do great work, as do all gardaí. I compliment them on their work. It is important that any safety aspect we can implement to help our gardaí and the great work they do, is crucial. I will ask the Minister about the recruitment of gardaí. I know he will be aware that it has become a considerable issue. I know he has been recruiting, but we need to do more to incentivise young women and men into An Garda Síochána. I ask that we do more on that. I am delighted support this legislation with anything I can do.

We are talking about enhancing the ability of gardaí to effectively and safely carry out their duties, which include ensuring the safety of the public and of course, their own safety, deterring any potential illegal or criminal behaviour and providing evidence where necessary. Other jurisdictions have been using this technology for years and it is about time we gave our gardaí similar resources. If we are to expect our gardaí to be able to fully and effectively fulfil their roles in a manner that ensures the safety of the community they serve and has tangible results, we must give them the tools to do so. Unfortunately, we have seen a lethargy on the part of Fine Gael, which has led the Department of Justice for more than a decade, to provide our gardaí with this level of technology. I say that before making any mention of Garda numbers. I am supportive of this measure. Body camera footage can act as a deterrent in cases of people who may wish to assault or intimidate gardaí as they carry out their work. A measure that can help to avoid this kind of assault from happening is important for gardaí and the effective policing of the communities that count on them. It also has the capacity to provide protection to our gardaí from spurious campaigns to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, thereby saving on resources and avoiding gardaí being unnecessarily taken from front-line duty. However, it can also have a direct impact on the ability to provide supportive evidence in cases of assault. Court cases such as these can be traumatising for their victim who, without the assistance of body camera footage, have to recount their trauma over and again. The role body cameras can play in this regard is positive. As with all technology that has the ability to capture data, we have to strike the right balance between protection and privacy. This requirement is fully justified and while some oppose it because of privacy concerns, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, has expressed its eagerness to ensure that its members will be properly trained to understand the correct situations in which it may be necessary to use these devices and to prevent overuse of this system, ensuring appropriate discretion. My constituency, like many others, has its own problems and the Garda faces its own challenges. Assaults are up, as are crimes against the person. Equipping gardaí with the technology that enhances their ability to protect themselves and their communities is an important development. We need to strike the correct balance between what is proposed and other technology out there. However, it does not let the Government off the hook when it comes to the need for adequate Garda numbers and the provision of the resources that would enable our gardaí to work as effectively as we would wish.

Regrettably, already this year, we have seen a number of serious assaults on gardaí. An officer was assaulted at an anti-asylum seeker protest in County Cork on 19 January. A traffic garda had part of his finger bitten off in a vicious attack in Ballymun on Friday, 20 January. Let us not forget the arson attacks on the homes of a Dundalk garda in recent years, which was the third attack on a Garda home in and around Dundalk in 18 months. This is on top of the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and the tragic killing of Garda Tony Golden. While all gardaí accept policing has its risks, there can never be any excuse for these disgraceful attacks. There were 144 attacks on gardaí in 2012. Last year, there were 241 attacks and, yet, basic measures such as body cameras are being stalled and are not due to be rolled out until 2024. Providing digital technology, including body cameras, dashcams and drones, to gardaí will help the prosecution of people who have committed crimes, as well as giving gardaí an additional tool to boost their personal safety. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide a robust statutory framework for the use of digital recording devices to support their key functions, such as the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal offences; safeguarding against and preventing threats to public safety and public order, and in matters relating to the security of the State. This includes the use of automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, CCTV and body-worn cameras as recommended in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. I will raise a number of items specifically relating the Bill. First and foremost, the use of such technology is controversial and has been opposed by the ICCL, which feels that digital recording and surveillance tools will impact people's rights to privacy; protection of personal data; freedom of expression; non-discrimination; protest and association. However, police in the UK have had body cameras for ten years. Any concerns being expressed about civil liberties have been addressed by other European nations. In addition, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has ensured that safeguards contingent on the EU artificial intelligence Act, will be put in place on the use of the technology, subject to data protection rules. Once legislation is agreed, deployment of these devices, including related timelines, will be an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Body cameras need to be piloted and training organised, but where is the plan? Will training be online or in person, or will it be hands-on? The unprecedented €2.14 billion allocated to An Garda Síochána under budget 2023 includes the provision of €3 million for preparatory work to support the introduction of body-worn cameras, along with €6 million for new ballistic vests to protect front-line gardaí. However, the problem is there is no specific timeframe. There is no prioritisation of the implementation. Second, the Bill will repeal and replace the CCTV provisions in section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. It will set out how CCTV schemes should be managed to reflect changes in the law on foot of the introduction of the data protection regulation and the law enforcement directive. I welcome this, as it provides clarity on the roles and responsibilities of both An Garda Síochána and local authorities in CCTV schemes. The Bill will also provide a statutory basis for the recording of 999 calls, which are transferred to the Garda, and for the recording of other emergency and non-emergency lines or numbers that will be specified in and governed by a code of practice. Third, the Bill provides a statutory basis for the expanded use of automatic number plate recognition technology. This will facilitate other bodies that have networks of ANPR cameras to transfer their ANPR records to An Garda Síochána. This provision allows access to live feeds and permits An Garda Síochána to approve access internally for a period of up to 72 hours. It also provides for access to data retained by third parties as a result of the operation of CCTV. This will help the prosecution of people who have committed crimes, as well as give gardaí an additional tool to prohibit the kind of aggression and violence that some officers have experienced in recent months. In addition, I welcome the provision within the Bill for the installation and operation of CCTV on Garda premises for the purpose of safeguarding persons or property and for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences. The powers in this Bill must be subject to sufficient controls and oversight to ensure their use is necessary an proportionate at all times, as there are potential implications for the right to privacy and the data protection rights of individuals. Overall, the Garda ethos is based not on force of arms but on its relationship with the community.That ethos has served us well but we need to keep our gardaí safe. The Bill needs to be enacted before the body cameras can be deployed. I hope they will be brought into operation as quickly as possible. Attacks on gardaí injure not just the victims themselves but communities as a whole.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	386	I was reviewing questions and previous statements in the House regarding the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's recommendation for the introduction of body-worn cameras. Policing organisations around the world have found such devices can help to improve front-line capability with the accurate recording of incidents, expedite analysis, enhance situation awareness and sometimes protect police from harm. They could probably do a lot more than that. There is overwhelming support within An Garda Síochána for the introduction of body cameras. If we are going to legislate in this House, the first thing we must do is engage with stakeholders who are on the front line and listen to what they have to say. It is fair comment to say that the policing environment in this country has changed very much over the past decade or two and, unfortunately, it seems to have changed even further over the past number of months. This is a significant concern for all gardaí and for anybody who is trying to uphold the law in this State. Unfortunately, we will have to be more radical in terms of policing, management and penal reform and the Bill is just one of the legs of that stool. Members have spoken about facial recognition. As the Ceann Comhairle will attest, we had a delegation in Leinster House yesterday from the Japanese embassy. If one were to speak to those people about where facial recognition is going and has already gone in Japan, one would realise that we are light years behind in that regard. I accept the fact that people have concerns as to the preservation of their digital identity but that can be worked out in the context of policy and management protocols.  Another point to note in the context of this Bill relates to the pervasive use of phones by the public to record their interactions with An Garda Síochána but gardaí do not have the right to make a reciprocal recording. Almost two years ago there was a tragic incident where a public figure in this country harassed a garda online and that garda subsequently took his own life. That is reprehensible but it is happening all of the time. It is even happening outside the gates of Leinster House when there are protests going on. We have to arm our public services and our police force appropriately and the Bill will do that I accept that there is the potential for data loss and data abuse and that has to be managed. I also accept that we need to have a rigorous system to protect access to information and digital identities in respect of the information that these cameras will deliver. However, regarding concerns expressed about GDPR, I was a member of the council in Waterford three years ago. We had major littering problems. People were backing up their cars and fly-tipping in certain areas but we could not deploy cameras to record the number plates of cars because of GDPR. That policy has softened somewhat but we are not fully there yet. At times we seem to fall down a rabbit hole and tie our own hands in terms of what we need to do.  On balance, I accept the assertions of An Garda Síochána that this tool is needed for better policing and that it can be appropriately used and managed. From that point of view, I support An Garda Síochána and the Bill.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	387	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I come from a rural constituency and while we do not experience much antisocial behaviour, we do experience antisocial activity such as dumping on private roads and on bogs. There is a bog beside my home that we spent last summer cleaning up. The clean-up cost the community approximately €5,000 and the council approximately €18,000. We have it secured now and it is right but we could not get anybody for the littering because we could not find the name of anybody on any bag and could not use CCTV footage given it would breach data protection rules. In the same way, we have had a spate of robberies in rural houses in my area in north Galway over the past number of months. Data protection is of no comfort to the people in these houses when they return from a walk or a trip to the shop to find that their house has been ransacked and their goods stolen. They feel powerless. Gardaí are trying to detect those involved but they do not have the tools that are necessary in this age to tackle these crimes. The criminals themselves have moved on and their technology has improved enormously. Gardaí need to have the support of the public, which they do, and of whatever technology they can get. We can get caught up with issues of privacy, data protection and all of that but it would be great if the registration number of a car coming off the motorway, going into a rural area and coming back out a few hours later, could be recorded. That is an important tool of detection for gardaí. The body cameras that gardaí will get are a necessary defence for them. Gardaí are human beings; they are members of families and communities and we must have more respect for them. Most people have respect for them but it is beginning to slip away a little bit. There are some who will challenge anybody in a uniform just because they feel he or she represents the establishment. In that context, it is important that we give gardaí as much protection as possible. This is related to the attractiveness of being a garda. It is important that we reassure young people who want to join An Garda Síochána and their parents, who might be worried about them joining, that they will be properly equipped to protect themselves and to detect crime.  It is important that we provide the tools necessary for the detection and conviction of criminals but also that we provide the basis for the prevention of further crime. If crime pays, it will continue but if crime is detected and people are punished for it, that is the best statement we can make. People say that our jails are overcrowded, there is no room and there is a revolving door, and that is true. However if we find people who are robbing houses and farms, taking stock and farm implements and selling them on, there must be a serious penalty for them. If they are on social welfare, for example, their payments should be stopped immediately. The only effective way to treat people who are robbers is to hit them in their pocket. That is very important. I might be a bit hard on the criminals but I know people who have been robbed in their houses and two years later, they are still coming to terms with it. They feel that their house has been desecrated. They do not feel comfortable in the homes that they might have spent the past 40 years living in and raising their families in.  We have to be on the side of the people who are being robbed. We also have to be on the side of the communities involved in community alert schemes and those who are working to try to help one another. We have to make sure that the laws are there to back up law-abiding people and to deal with the criminals. I will support the Bill because it is important. The training of staff and the retention of data is important. The equipment must be workable at all times, unlike in the past when CCTV cameras were erected in the middle of towns but there was nobody monitoring them. I have seen this so many times. Cameras were put up in playgrounds but no monitoring station was attached to them. Something was put some place, it was locked up and never seen again after that. It is important that whatever we do into the future, we do it in a way that is effective. We must buy the equipment, install it and make sure it is maintained, policed and used for its intended purpose. That is very important as well.

I welcome the many provisions in the Bill that will support the work of An Garda Síochána and the essential duty it performs in this State. We are lucky to live in a democracy where there is policing by consent and the police force is, in general, held in such high regard. It is, of course, imperative that the State provides all the safeguards it can to best protect members of An Garda as they daily place themselves in the line of danger while performing their duties and, therefore, I welcome the many provisions of the Bill in that light. The principle of consent is an important one. It is an aspect of the social contract that co-creates the State among its people and involves a delicate balancing act between rights to individual liberty placed against the constraints the State may place on that liberty for the common good. These choices and how we make them characterise the nature of the State. I am concerned by the Minister's signalled intention to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to govern the use of facial recognition technology, FRT. That represents a large shift in that balance of freedoms and constraints. It is evident that he believes it is consequential, given that he devoted almost five minutes of his opening remarks to this issue. He outlined many powerful arguments in favour of FRT and they deserve careful consideration but many people, including many of the previous speakers across the House, have raised concerns with regard to civil liberty implications but also the current efficacy and accuracy of the technology. There is a growing body of evidence that FRT can be inherently biased, with divergent error rates across demographic groups having been exposed. The poorest accuracy is consistently found in respect of subjects who are female, black and between 18 and 30 years of age. For example, in the UK more than 1,000 young black men were removed from a so-called gang database when it was uncovered that they had no gang affiliation at all. I am conscious of moves to legislate on this issue at EU level. The artificial intelligence Act, published by the Commission in 2021, is currently working its way through the legislative process at EU level but is not anticipated to be complete until 2024 at the earliest. With that timeline in mind, it may be more appropriate for us to delay legislating for the use of live searches using FRT in particular until that EU position is finalised. Given the gravity of this issue, would it not be more appropriate to allow the Bill to progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas without the introduction of FRT amendments on Committee Stage and to then return to the issue through stand-alone legislation that would allow for meaningful public consultation, including a full pre-legislative scrutiny process, on the introduction of FRT to policing in Ireland?

The Minister will be aware that I raised this issue on several occasions in the past year. I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which has long been sought by gardaí and their representative associations. The Bill provides for the use of body-worn cameras by gardaí and the expanded use of ANPR technology. It also contains provisions relating to CCTV footage and the recording of phone calls. It is essential that good oversight of data protection be initiated from the outset. Body-worn cameras are widely used across the EU as an effective tool for evidence gathering in the investigation of crime. They can protect both the public and gardaí. The Bill does not deal with the usage of body-worn cameras by private security firms. The sector is eager for action in this area to provide protection for its staff and members of the public. I hope that matter will be examined in the near future. I thank An Garda for its efforts to prevent and investigate crime and antisocial behaviour. It is not an easy job and Garda members are on the front line. They place themselves at risk on our behalf every day. I am sure all parties across the House are grateful for their efforts and service. Thanks is not enough, however. As an Oireachtas, we need to provide legislation to support front-line gardaí. This Bill legislating for body cameras is such a measure. I welcome the commitment of the Government to enact this year the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will increase the maximum penalty for the offence of assault causing harm, from five years' imprisonment to ten. However, further action from the Minister is required to deal with the attacks on gardaí and first responders. Mandatory minimum sentences should be introduced. There should be no tolerance for attacks on members of An Garda Síochána, the fire brigade, the ambulance service and other first responders in our society.

The Bill has been long delayed and the Government should have got its act together many years ago. As noted by previous speakers, other European countries have been using body cameras for more than a decade. Fine Gael has been in government for almost 11 years but it is only now introducing this legislation. What priority has it placed on protecting front-line gardaí and keeping communities safe? It is important that there be proper regulation in place for the protection of the public, as well as of gardaí while using these cameras on duty. Restrictions on when and where these devices are used and the protection of data captured on them must be in place alongside the legislation. Sinn Féin will closely examine the legislation and table amendments where necessary to ensure gardaí and communities get the protection they need. Too many communities simply do not feel safe. Year after year, Fine Gael in government has left An Garda understaffed and under-resourced. The Dublin region experienced the largest loss of gardaí since 2009. It lost a total of 757 gardaí in that time. My area, which covers Clondalkin, Lucan, Palmerstown, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Brittas, experienced a big decrease in Garda numbers during that time - a total of more than 6% of all gardaí. Fine Gael, the so-called party of law and order, has decimated policing in my area. Communities in certain parts of my area feel abandoned and unsafe. The biggest decrease in my area is in the number of community gardaí. In 2020, we had 86 community gardaí across all the areas I mentioned. That number has dropped to 64 in the past two years. Areas such as Saggart, Rathcoole and Newcastle have experienced the fastest growth in the State. Those communities want gardaí physically present, particularly in the evenings. The presence of gardaí who walk the beat and speak to residents builds strong relationships and offers communities a sense of security. I welcome that the Bill is being debated today but it should not have taken the harrowing scenes in Ballyfermot to force the Government to act. I will put that despicable incident into context. The two young gardaí who were attacked were not from Ballyfermot Garda station; they were from my local Garda station, in Ronanstown. They were only in Ballyfermot on that night to provide overtime cover due to the lack of gardaí in Ballyfermot. That is just not good enough. Gardaí have been left vulnerable and put at risk. While I welcome the introduction of body cameras, I would much rather there be additional bodies to wear those cameras rather than just having the cameras themselves.

Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. It is a temporary appointment, for good reason. I wish the Minister, Deputy McEntee, all the best in her future. It is a wonderful and joyous occasion for her and I hope it all goes well. The general scheme of the Bill contained the objective of providing a legal basis for law enforcement use of body cameras, along with other recording devices such as mobile phones. The proposal would also expand the use of CCTV footage and ANPR technology. Emphasising the role of the technology in enhancing law enforcement practices, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, stated in May that employing controversial facial recognition technology could revolutionise An Garda to manage child exploitation, which is very serious, as well as missing person and murder cases. The technology would also help to exonerate innocent parties by revealing their whereabouts at the time of a crime.  If enacted, the Bill would allow An Garda to input an image of a perpetrator into a system that would provide instant access to images taken in public places of the suspect or those who resemble the suspect.This process, according to the Department of Justice, would enhance the speed and facility with which gardaí could locate and identify suspects. We would all welcome that. It would be great if it happened. These proposals, however, have been the subject of significant criticism from data protection and human rights perspectives, notwithstanding that they include a number of safeguards. For example, rigorous human rights and data protection impact assessments must be completed before the legislation can be finalised. Also, the Bill would need to comply with the GDPR Act. While the original general scheme of the Bill did not include face recognition technology – this is very important and I want the Minister to understand it, as I hope he will – it is now almost certain that its use is to be pushed through by the Government on Committee Stage. That is not very good and I am not in favour of it. If I could support the Garda Síochána 1,000%, I would. All my life I have been in community alert. Our community alert group, set up in Newcastle in 1985, was the second in the country. It is still active and engaging. There is a two-way street and the changes proposed need to be reversed. I recently attended a very pleasant function, the Cahir Garda party for senior citizens. I sometimes have a Minister come to it. It has been running for 24 years and I have been involved in it every year. It took place last Friday evening in Cahir House Hotel. I could not say enough about it. It is the best PR machine the Garda could have. Almost 200 senior citizens sat down for a meal, proudly facilitated by David Walsh of Cahir House Hotel and his staff and the Cahir gardaí. Superintendent Eddie Golden provided the music with a wonderful band. Inspector Mark Allen attended and poured out the tea, coffee and everything else with the community gardaí. It was just spectacular. Transition year students from Coláiste Dún Iascaigh and the McGrath School of Irish Dance provided entertainment. The school is run by my niece, so I declare an interest. Cahir Men's Shed, a group of eight, played for hours. The event started at 4 o'clock in the evening. The real party started at 5 p.m. and went on until maybe 10 p.m. People I have not mentioned also took part. I did not meet our new superintendent. I compliment Superintendent Eddie Golden. He was in Cahir Garda station but has now transferred to Thurles. I also pay tribute to Chief Superintendent Derek Smart, who is now imithe elsewhere. We have lost our chief superintendent in Tipperary. I compliment the community garda team, including Jenny Gough and Judy Davern. They kindly got a loan of the bus from the Limerick Garda division and connected the people. You would think the old people were loaded into paddy-wagons but they were not paddy-wagons. "Loaded into" is the wrong phrase to use. The old people were encouraged in and helped. They experienced great joy at the party, with the gardaí ag rince leis na daoine go léir in their uniforms. Transition year students and Cahir and Clonmel scout groups were also present. There was a massive meitheal effort to bring joy. There was no party over the two years of Covid, so it was great to be back. The party has been going on for 24 years and it was wonderful. I commend all the sponsors. Members of Cahir choral society came to sing. All sorts of groups were involved. The Garda could not buy that kind of publicity or engagement from all the places in the hinterland, including Ballyporeen, Skeheenarinky, Ard Fhíonáin, An Caisleán Nua, Bansha, Kilmoyler, Poulmucka and New Inn. There were people from all around and they were delighted to be back with a bang. I danced the night out with many like me. As Joe Dolan used to say, "Send them home sweating." By God, did I go home sweating. The sweat was pouring off me because I am not as fit as I thought I was. We had a great night. I compliment all concerned. I acknowledge all the activities of the community gardaí. The Government does not support the Garda in enough things, and that is why I am saying I have concerns about facial recognition. The gardaí will be able to feed in images. The Government seems determined to push through this. It did not go through prelegislative scrutiny although the other parts of the Bill did. It must go through it, even though I want to give every tool of the trade that I can to the Garda and condemn anyone who attacks, splits, threatens or intimidates members of the Garda, or indeed takes compromising videos. The provision should not be included. We must be very careful about how videos from body cams are stored and ensure they will not be released. Some videos taken on phones, not body cams, have been released. We have seen that. They can do awful damage. I am a big supporter of An Garda Síochána but there are bad apples in every organisation. We have seen this. I myself was a victim of false allegations and was brought through the courts. It cost me a lot of money given the legal representation. I spent 18 days in the Circuit Court and cleared my good name, but sin scéal eile. There are many areas about which I hope to talk to the Minister. Lisa Temple, from near Bray in the Minister's constituency, was treated horrifically by An Garda Síochána. A mob – a heavy gang – came along from the Bank of Ireland. They were no better than thugs. They went into the house when the woman's two young daughters were there. What went on was obscene.

It is happening in the Chair's county too, and mine. It was gardaí in the Chair's county who tried to get me locked up. Anyway, I know some Members here might like to see me locked up. Thanks be to God, everybody here has a good name. This legislation is worrying as well as everything else. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, along with six academics working in the area, wrote an open letter to the Minister for Justice in November noting the use of facial recognition technology also raises serious and challenging issues concerning individual privacy and data rights, in a world where population-level mass surveillance is no longer a dystopian fiction but an easy thing to implement. What we need are bodies, not body cams, because the force is depleted. We have fewer than 100 recruits in Templemore at the moment but should have 300. We must examine why young men and women are not opting to join An Garda Síochána. We must make the organisation a safe place to work. We must have respect for its members, make the job rewarding for them, and give the backup. We had representations from people in Lisronagh. The Minister's predecessor met them. There were major attacks and marauding gangs going around. Gardaí and beangardaí were going up and down the street on their own at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning with no backup. They tell us we cannot use the term "beangarda" anymore. I will use it anyway. In the Chair's own town, Lismore, Cappoquin and Ballymacarbry, numbers are being totally depleted. Garda stations that used to have a sergeant and three or four gardaí no longer have them. They need them because people need them to be physically present. I am all for number plate recognition, especially off the motorways because of the gangs that travel down them and carry out heinous crimes. Already people are becoming increasingly desensitised to facial recognition technology to unlock phone handsets or move through airport passport control. Such uses produce databases of unique biometric facial identifiers that can be combined with larger profiling databases. I resent this and totally object to it. Where are the data stored? Who has it? Big tech companies are making a fortune out of it. We are becoming monopolised as a human race, which should not be happening. Technology is good if used right and in the right place. As the ICCL letter notes, in Ireland greater consideration and consultation – including with the Data Protection Commission – are needed before any legislative proposals of the kind in question are even published. In addition, there is major EU-level legislation pending that considers face recognition technology and that would potentially force immediate changes to the rushed Irish legislation.We should therefore make haste slowly here. Now is not the time for the Department of Justice or the Government to rush such measures through this House. Civil liberty and privacy campaigners have expressed great concern over the move, highlighting what they see as a possibility of discrimination. We will see discrimination.  I was speaking about An Garda Síochána and the community gardaí and the whole division in Tipperary a minute ago. We do not have enough gardaí and so they are pulled off community duties. The Garda station in Clonmel is a hovel. You could not call it anything else. Several Ministers for Justice and Taoisigh have visited. The issue was first raised in this Chamber by the former Ceann Comhairle, Seán Treacy, who is now dead, 50 years ago. We badly need this station. We now have a site and planning and design has been done but there is no sign of the airgead. It was lumped in with a bundle of different Garda stations that then fell off the train. This included Bandon and Sligo. It is now bundled with another Garda station in Cork but it is also in a bundle with the children's law court. When getting a builder for a design and build contract, a law court is a completely different animal from a Garda station. Law courts normally have a fine facade and are fine big buildings like the new courts out near the Phoenix Park. You need totally different architects because they require totally different designs as they are totally different buildings. The courthouse should be removed from that bundle. Let the children's court come under a separate contract because you are fishing in a different pond for different kinds of builders, architects, designers and so on to deliver such a building. It is a completely different project and I do not know why it has been put in here. I believe it was put in as a delaying tactic, which is wrong. On the Prison Service, with the indulgence of the Chair, I will pay tribute to Assistant Chief Officer, Trevor Darling, who retired from Limerick Prison in the past ten days. He was one of the really good prison management officers. I also wish the governor of Cork Prison, Peter O'Brien, who is soon to retire, well. He is also a highly respected prison officer and has also given excellent service. It is the same with all of the retired gardaí, many of whom attended the function last week that I have mentioned. I am glad that they gave their service and survived. We know that a number of gardaí have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives. We saw what happened at Lordship Credit Union. We can have no truck with people who assassinate members of An Garda Síochána in cold blood in this country. It should not be tolerated. Where there are complaints, which do arise, there must be proper channels and processes to deal with them. People often come to my clinics who have issues with different gardaí in different Garda stations. If there was to be this facial recognition on the body cams, it would have to be used very sensitively. The Minister mentioned body cams and CCTV. Schemes have been held up in my town of Fethard, in Clonmel and all over Tipperary over concerns about data storage from the county council and An Garda Síochána. I am the chairman of a community alert group that installed one of the first such systems 20 years ago in a little village, An Caisleán Nua. The Garda made us take it down despite the fact that the Garda crime prevention officer at the time - his name eludes me but he is now retired - had come out to okay it and told us where to put the cameras. This was at a community house, Tigh na nDaoine, which is a wonderful place. The system was locked. Only An Garda Síochána had the key to the secure cabinet so only gardaí could access it. We had to take it down. That left a bad taste in the mouth of the community because we had raised funds to cover the cost, which was about €6,000, and then had to remove it. Gardaí regularly go into the shops there. My sister is a shop owner in the village. They often solve crimes by looking at the private CCTV. I cannot understand why we have delayed community CCTV for so long. Gardaí often use it. I know of a woman who was beaten up and robbed at the Ballymacarbry community centre. Tá aithne ag an gCathaoirleach Gníomhach ag an áit sin. The Halfway House, in the Acting Chair's area, which is now closed, had CCTV. It was able to identify the number passing and the gardaí were able to solve that crime and get that criminal for his heinous crime because of that help. Despite that, we could not put up CCTV in the community.  There is too much red tape, too much baloney and too many issues. The scheme in Clonmel needs to be renewed and it is now being renewed and extended. I salute the work of councillors and members of An Garda Síochána who are trying to progress this. It has been slow. I attend most of the county joint policing committee meetings and this is discussed ad infinitum. However, there is no replacement for the man on the beat. We had an excellent garda in Newcastle, who succumbed to cancer, Sergeant Niall O'Halloran. He was tremendous. He was on duty 24-7, even when he was not rostered. Most people who wanted his mobile number had it. We now have Garda John Walsh, who came out to us. I thank the superintendent for leading him out to us and for making sure he stayed in our area, which is made up of Newcastle, Ardfinnan, Ballybacon and Grange. Garda Walsh covers these and other areas with Garda Philly Ryan and Garda Donovan from Ballyporeen. They do an excellent job. They know the people. They have to. People go in to sign a form for a passport or something else. The garda will say "Hello Pat", "Hello John", "Hello Mary" or whatever. The people can have confidence in them. Something might jig their mind and remind them they saw something. That could be the solving of a crime but there needs to be that two-way street. People have to respect their gardaí and they have to respect the community.  The Minister will have to support the text alert groups. They are raising funds every day to keep the texts coming out in respect of crime. It is gardaí who decide when they are sent out. It may be, for example, when there is a suspicious vehicle. I am not saying they are sent out foolishly or anything like that but it is an awful drain on the community alert groups. That should be funded. It is great back-up for the Garda and it has run criminals out of communities. People mobilise, get the Garda, run around in cars and form a kind of meitheal. I am not advocating violence or anything like that but they frighten them off and criminals leave the area. The text alerts are a wonderful system. Property marking is now being rolled out nationally from Tigh na nDaoine in Newcastle, An Caisleán Nua, which I mentioned. The Minister must come and visit some time. A previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the late Brian Lenihan, visited many years ago. Property marking is vital. Everyone knows they have to able to identify their property. There should be a proper number applied with proper equipment. My colleague, Senator Keogan, and her husband have a property marking machine and bring it to different communities. They are expensive machines and people have to be trained to use them but they are brilliant. An Garda often has warehouses full of stolen items but people cannot claim them. People may identify their machines, expensive hoovers and expensive lawnmowers but, if they have no identification on it, they cannot claim it. Property marking is very important. You have a property number. You turn the machine upside down and, in some secret place, that number is there. It cannot be rubbed off. The number is then paired up and the equipment is returned to its rightful owner. I wish the Bill well but there is a lot of teasing out to be done. The Minister must make haste slowly. He has to take out this facial recognition because too many people, including myself, are opposed to it. I would vote against the whole Bill just to stop that part.
#ReadaCronin	unknown-#ReadaCronin-party	unknown-#ReadaCronin-dob	unknown-#ReadaCronin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	402	Sinn Féin supports the proposal on body cams provided there is strict supervision, monitoring and protocols. As has been already outlined by some of my comrades, we have concerns about facial recognition provisions being introduced to a Bill that has already gone through prelegislative scrutiny. It is really not good enough. It goes without saying that technology must be always used in a way that ensures a careful balance between privacy and the protection of the citizen through the most serious and rigorous regulation and supervision. It is impossible to overstate the need for all of this. Training and oversight are, therefore, critical. Something with such a big reach demands equally big responsibility, responsibility that must be demanded and upheld constantly by our gardaí. Gardaí are still undervalued and under-resourced. I say this as a Deputy for Kildare, which as one of the lowest ratios of gardaí to residents in the State, and as the daughter of a garda who loved his job and who gave himself to it, heart and soul. Like millions of people in this State, I am horrified by the appalling way in which our gardaí are being treated by a tiny number of far-right thugs, who are actively and cynically exploiting the concerns of ordinary local people in their communities for their own ends. These thugs could not give a ha'penny damn about them, their lives, their families or their futures.They will happily go on to their next crusade, their next grudge, and leave decent, ordinary people in the wreckage they have created. I have grave concerns, as do many of my colleagues, that some eejit of a young fella, riled up by the hard men with their incendiary talk of rape and burning people out of their homes, will destroy the lives of other people as well as his own. Our young, impressionable people, no matter how old they are or how tough they think they are, need protection from these cowards masquerading as patriots who do not even know their national flag from the flag of the Ivory Coast. Parents taken in with this rubbish would want to think long and hard about the impact they could be having on their own children. They need only look at any school gate and see the rainbow of colours walking in and out on any given day. Our kids have friends from many different nations and play with them every day. There is no leadership from the Government on this and I ask the Government to take its head out of the sand and lead on what is in front of it. Most Irish people do not have a white supremacist bone in their body. What is annoying a lot of these communities is that they see their small community spaces being given over and taken over by the great and the good, who are going to be making an absolute fortune out of many of these contracts. The Government has a duty to prevent violence and tragedy. It has a duty to our people and to our gardaí. There is no use wringing our hands about it later on when lives are shattered and futures stolen. I commend the gardaí who have experienced scurrilous approaches from these far-right thugs. I want to let them know we appreciate their calm in the face of such outright thuggery. I would also like to take the opportunity to mark the retirement of our local superintendent in Kildare, Martin Walker, who is retiring on Friday after 40 years in the service. I thank him on behalf of everybody in Kildare for his commitment to us and the force.

In his speech, he acknowledged that Members inside the House and people outside the House would have different viewpoints. I certainly have a very different viewpoint on this Bill. Let me also say that I have the greatest respect for the gardaí on the ground. Many is the time I have had little respect for the management, as with all institutions. That was not helped by my introduction to the Dáil in February or March 2016, when the first document I read was the O'Higgins report in respect of Sergeant McCabe. I do not think we can mention that man's name often enough with respect and with gratitude for what he did. That was my introduction. I have read many reports after that from High Court judges and various people on Garda behaviour. When I talk about Garda behaviour, I talk about it from the top down. In my role as a Deputy and as a mother, I am the first to ring the guards in the expectation that they will come and that I can trust them and tell them what is happening. I am talking here about what has happened with the Garda. The Minister will remember the Morris tribunal. He might remember the price of that and the foolishness of thinking those matters were confined to one geographical area in Donegal. Had anybody at the time thought to look at that, we might have pre-empted what happened subsequently with Sergeant McCabe but we did not do that, of course. Then there was the collusion between the Garda and the Northern Ireland police force, the Smithwick tribunal. There is any amount of examples. The Minister must forgive me if I come from a very sceptical position. I adopt that same position in respect of my own role as a Deputy and this institution. I constantly question myself and all institutions because they end up protecting themselves and they do not end up serving the people they are there to serve, including councils and local authorities that have taken on the mantle of corporatisation. We did have councils that served. Institutions are always in danger of serving themselves and becoming more important than the people they are there to serve.  The title of the Bill seems innocuous: Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022. The Minister's speech failed utterly to ease out the balance that must be made between the fundamental right to privacy and the infringement, intrusion or invasion of that right for the common good or public safety. That is a very delicate teasing out. Top of the list has to be the fundamental right to privacy. We take that away at our peril. When we take it away, we must do it in a way that is measured, necessary, proportionate and only for a certain length of time. Those safeguards are not here at all for me to see and I have done my best. I welcome some of the provisions. I welcome the mandatory human rights assessment and that there is an acknowledgement that there must be a data processing assessment and so on. I welcome those provisions. The Minister must forgive me for straying again but it is all relevant. When we were debating Report Stage of the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill 2022 yesterday, one of the things that was lacking from the title was putting it in context, which is for what various groups, such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and various organisations on the ground, asked. We should enshrine in the title the fundamental principles of human rights and then the legislation derives from that. That was not done. It certainly has not been done here. The title is minimalist and underestimates what we are doing. I try to stay away from my own opinion even though I am after telling the Minister I am very sceptical. I do my best to read the documents of the experts who went before the Joint Committee on Justice. I welcome the report of the joint committee and the work that went into prelegislative scrutiny. I am often standing here criticising the fact that prelegislative scrutiny has not happened. In this case, it did happen and I want to acknowledge that. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties states that it has concerns about this Bill which proposes to significantly expand the ability of gardaí, including civilian and reserve gardaí, to monitor people's behaviour in public spaces. It states that this will impact people's rights to privacy, data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and will engage protections against non-discrimination. I do not think we can disagree about what is set out here, maybe on the extent to which the Bill is infringing those rights. I think the Minister will accept that it is infringing. That has been acknowledged.  It is important to address the right to privacy because it is not set out anywhere. The right to privacy is protected by Bunreacht na hÉireann, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. Of course it may be limited and I am sure the colleagues to my right more learned than I are going to talk about that. The right to privacy is protected in all of these legal instruments. The Data Protection Act 2018, which is fundamental, gives effect to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, with which we are all semi-familiar, and the law enforcement directive. Parts 5 and 6 of the 2018 Act concern the processing of personal data by data controllers who are competent for their role. Local authorities and the Garda have utterly failed to comply with their obligations in the operation of CCTV cameras.That is not my opinion; that is the Data Protection Commissioner's opinion and I understand that the Data Protection Commission is continuing in its investigations into Garda stations and 31 local authorities. In general terms, article 5 of the GDPR sets out key principles which are central to data protection, namely: 	Lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation [so we do not have creep. If there is a reason and a purpose it should be set out clearly.]; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality; and accountability.I thank the Library and Research Service for setting this out for us in the Bill digest, and I want to thank the ICCL, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and all of the other organisations that have made submissions and helped us. The Bill digest states:the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights allow for an encroachment upon the right to privacy where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. The use of technology for law enforcement purposes gives rise to such an infringement on the individual’s right to privacy and data protection. [It has to be done in proportionate and necessary way.] To ensure that such infringements are necessary and proportionate, the European Data Protection Supervisor recommends:“... a law enforcement measure, if and when assessed to be necessary, should then be analysed according to whether it would be more proportionate if it were limited to only serious crimes." [and it goes on to expand on that.] With respect to video-surveillance [which is an integral part of this, in all its forms, including drones], the EDPS also stated that such "systems should not be installed if they are not effective in achieving their purposes, for example, if they merely provide the illusion of greater security".In all my political career I have heard certain segments of people on the ground and councillors crying out for more CCTV cameras. I remember doing a lot of research at the time and gathering up the research papers and there was no evidence to justify the installation of CCTV cameras in the manner in which they were being installed. If we fast forward to 2023 it is more than 22 years later and the evidence on what we are putting through here is, at the very least, inconclusive. The Minister talked about evidence this morning when he was interviewed and I noticed that there was a complete failure to follow up on what that evidence is because I would love to see it. I have read all of those documents and the evidence on the surveillance we are carrying out is, at best, contradictory and inconclusive. These organisations have asked us to be careful in what we are doing, and that includes the Policing Authority. They are of graded opinions on what they find of concern. The ICCL is the most outspoken on its concerns. The Policing Authority had great concerns as well, although it saw some advantage in the Bill. It said it depended on how it was managed and protected and on the oversight. I see the Chair of the Committee on Justice, Deputy Lawless, is here, and I have already thanked him for the committee’s work and detailed scrutiny of the Bill. We have 15 recommendations from that committee, having looked at and listened to all of these submissions. It recommended:that the Codes of Practice covering Head 2 ensure that the information and data collected by body-worn cameras... and CCTV devices will not use Facial Recognition Technology [that is recommendation no. 1]... and will not be used to racially profile members of the public.I will leave it to the Chair of the committee to go through the recommendations but what jumps out at me is that it recommended: "a pilot scheme to trial the use of recording devices and BWCs" [body-worn cameras]. Part 2 of the Bill concerns the operation of recording devices by the Garda. This part does not include CCTV or ANPR. It includes the use of a device that is remotely controlled and can be attached to an animal. It states that its use must be “necessary and proportionate” and in line with “an applicable code of practice”. There are no codes of practice to be seen anywhere. I would have thought we would have seen those. I read some explanation that there cannot be a code of practice because of the complexity of procurement and that this has to be sorted out first to see what is appropriate. I welcome the fact that if we are going to go with this the recording devices have to be overt, although I am concerned that the term “in so far as practicable” is in the Bill. Part 3 of the Bill looks at the use of ANPR. Again, it must be "proportionate” and "data sharing" agreements are mentioned. I am concerned about the “focussed monitoring” of a particular vehicle for up to three months. I am also concerned with the way that can be authorised without the District Court and that the District Court can make in camera decisions on authorisations and renewals. I understand this was not discussed during pre-legislative scrutiny but I can be corrected on that. I mention the statutory basis for recording phone calls to and from the Garda station. This follows on from the Fennelly Commission and there was no statutory basis up until now for the recording of phone calls. Gardaí have been operating illegally or with no legal status, monitoring or taping people’s phone conversations. Then we have the change to the legal framework for the authorisation and installation of cameras. This is particularly interesting for me, coming from 17 years in the local authority. Under statute, only Garda personnel and local authorities will be authorised to operate such schemes. Why is that? It is because the Data Protection Commission is still carrying out investigations? I am subject to the Minister’s correction on that. The Data Protection Commission has previously investigated the use of CCTV for law enforcement purposes and found several infringements. This Bill is seeking to correct that situation. However, my difficulty is the Data Protection Commission is still carrying out its investigations, and these are the most serious infringements without any contract or written agreement between the local authority and the Garda or a third party operator. There are many other infringements and we are not waiting for that investigation to be completed. What I have read is of serous concern to me. I was part of a local authority that saw the operation of those CCTV cameras without any clarity or legal basis. The legal basis that was there was infringed by both the Garda and the local authority personnel. That is of serious concern to me. Then there is part 6 of the Bill, which concerns the power of a member of the Garda to process live feeds of third party CCTV. The listeners need to know we are giving the power to the Garda to access, in whatever manner is appropriate, remotely or otherwise, CCTV cameras somewhere else outside of Garda operation and operated by a third party. We are going to do that without any judicial authorisation in certain situations. In other situations there will be judicial authorisation and then that authorisation can go on for quite some time. I have huge difficulties with that. I have already welcomed the mandatory human rights assessment. I am nearing the end of my time so I will stick to quotes form the organisations. The European Convention on Human Rights stated that the use of surveillance technology should be particularly precise, considering their invasiveness and the potential for the sophistication in technology to increase over time. The test of being "necessary and proportionate" is mentioned 16 times in the Bill. The staff in my office outlined this, as did the staff in the Library and Research Service. However, there are no criteria in the Bill which define how this test will be carried out. As mentioned already, the ICCL talks about the vast expansion of the surveillance powers of the Garda, without sufficient evidence that these developments are necessary in an Irish context and under our international obligations, proportionate to the risk they pose to a range of rights. The Policing Authority is not known to be very radical, and it has done great work during Covid. I read all of its reports and it expressed concerns about the use of recording devices such as drones. It expressed concern that they would become normalised and recommended that the legislation set out the principles and standards of accountability and oversight. We have all the other worries about profiling and bias, which are built into the technology as I understand it. We also have concerns over policing in certain areas and there is generally a whole range of concerns that I would have thought should have been teased out in the Minister’s speech.While we want to protect the Garda, it must be done within the context of human rights and in a limited way for a limited purpose that is proportionate and necessary. That is not what is happening here. That is not what the ICCL believes is happening. It tells us that it will go on to look at facial recognition technology, which was never discussed, yet, the Ministers, Deputies Harris and McEntee, state that they will produce an amendment. Deputies have been deprived of the process of pre-legislative scrutiny on that. It will be brought forward as an amendment. The ICCL is concerned that the Bill will enable gardaí to routinely collect, retain, store and search vast amounts of the personal data relating to members of the public. It believes that facial recognition technology has no place in Irish policing and goes on to clarify why that is the case . It has great concerns about the live feed, which I share, relating to the Garda accessing third-party video or CCTV footage with or without District Court judge approval, depending on the situation. This legislation is wrong. The Garda needs protection. There could be a place for cameras, depending how they are monitored, how the data is collected, who uses them, when they are used and when they are switched off. I noted various comments about domestic violence by the Minister. I am a little cynical in that regard, particularly as someone who has repeatedly addressed the issue of domestic and gender-based violence in the House and what is lacking in that area. Suddenly, body-worn cameras will be a great asset when a garda attends a domestic incident. I am a little cynical about such use. The Minister might clarify whether that was discussed with Women's Aid and all the other organisations that have been in contact with Deputies.

I wish to discuss with him the need for some type of support schemes or compensation measures to assist businesses and individuals dependant on seasonal tourism, in particular, where there is a very substantial reduction in available tourism accommodation, due to the fact that hotels and other accommodation providers are now providing accommodation for refugees. This, of course, has a significant impact on local businesses depending on tourists and visitors alike in the short and long term. While this issue impacts on a number of different places in my constituency and elsewhere, I raise it in the context of a meeting I attended earlier this week with my colleagues, Deputy MacSharry and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, in Rosses Point, County Sligo, on Monday last. As a follow-up to that meeting, Deputy MacSharry suggested tabling a Topical Issue matter. We agreed to do that. I will be crystal clear. The tone and content of the meeting at Rosses Point was constructive and sought solutions. There was no blame game and no anti-refugee sentiment. In fact, it was the opposite. There was, however, a recognition that the impact of a huge increase in the population of Rosses Point and the consequent impact on all public services, as well as the loss of significant numbers of beds for the upcoming tourism season, must be managed for the community, businesses and refugees. As one man at the meeting said, if the situation were reversed, he would not want to be stuck in a hotel in Ukraine. It is in that context and framework of seeking solutions and managing the situation that I will mention the broader need for accelerated and co-ordinated action, first, to appoint a dedicated community liaison officer to help ensure integration of new arrivals in the area, second, to increase bus capacity to and from Rosses Point, especially at peak times and school times and, third, increase policing in the peninsula to help ensure security for all. I will tease out the final issue a little more. This is the need to appoint a dedicated tourism officer to address the loss of revenue to local, tourism-dependent businesses. It is important to remember that those businesses employ people, support the fabric of Rosses Point, and pay taxes and rates to maintain the area. If they close or downsize, the impact is felt throughout the community. I ask the Minister of State to consider some Covid-type supports for businesses that are interdependent on tourism accommodation. We are speaking of restaurants, bars, and businesses involving maritime or other leisure activities. Approximately 25% of the tourism accommodation outside Dublin is now devoted to housing refugees. In some places, such as Rosses Point, the figure is much higher. Is there any possibility of some kind of support scheme specifically for those businesses where it can be shown that the impact is substantial? It is not just support schemes for loss of income. It is also about greater marketing for areas that are worst affected. That is where a dedicated tourism officer could help to support business. The first stage was helping to house refugees. I am fully supportive of that, as are the people who attended that meeting. The next stage is to support both communities and refugees. We are now at the next stage. I want to hear what plans the Government has in place for that.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	408	The Deputy raised the issue of support schemes and compensation measures to help businesses and individuals that are dependent on seasonal tourism, which could be adversely affected by the reduction in capacity available this season due to hotels and other tourism accommodation being used to house international asylum seekers and Ukrainian people fleeing war. I thank her for relaying the constructive tone of the meeting at Rosses Point and the constructive tone also shown by her and Deputies Feighan and MacSharry. We are approaching the first anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine. Since then, the people of Ireland have welcomed more than 90,000 people between those fleeing that war in Ukraine and other applicants for international protection. This is, by some distance, the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State and the Irish people, and tourism accommodation has played a highly significant role in the national response to the crisis. This has placed a strain on the availability of tourism accommodation, with knock-on impacts for other tourism businesses and businesses in the wider local economy.Officials in the Department with responsibility for tourism are engaging with a range of Departments, with input from Fáilte Ireland, to consider how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of the long-term use of tourism accommodation. Analysis is being done in those towns or areas most impacted by the unavailability of tourism accommodation. In addition, I can confirm the Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid-build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. These rapid-build homes will be constructed on State-owned land. The OPW is leading this in conjunction with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The objective is to install 500 units by March or April of this year. The strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year was very welcome but it is fair to say that the tourism industry faces a number of challenges this year. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. In Ireland hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry. In budget 2023 the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, who apologises for not being here, secured €15 million in additional funding for overseas marketing of Ireland. As global competition heightens, sustaining extensive marketing campaigns will be vital to support the ongoing recovery effort, building on the initial inbound tourism demand seen in 2022. The budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including a continuation of the investment in skills development and retention, which is €3 million. This provision will facilitate the continuation of work with Fáilte Ireland to address the employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, helping skills development and retaining staff. There is a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. The Minister also secured additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Tourism agencies are working hard to help those in the tourism sector. Tourism Ireland will roll out an extensive and targeted programme of activity in 2023 with a total marketing budget of €78 million. A wide range of promotional activities will be undertaken, including a new global marketing campaign, publicity and programming as well as working with tourism industries at home and overseas to facilitate the sales. Fáilte Ireland will announce plans shortly for work in the area of recruitment and retention of staff and sustainability. The temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which is designed to help businesses to cover their energy costs in the winter months, will run until 28 February. The Government is looking at reviewing the operation of the scheme. The Minister has received extensive feedback from the tourism sector, in written form and in person at the hospitality and tourism forum that she co-chairs. She is also aware that the 9% VAT rate is to the forefront of tourism businesses and individuals at present. A strong message was taken away from the recent hospitality and tourism forum meeting on the need to ensure there is no cliff edge with regard to the supports that have already been put in place. The Minister will continue with her regular interaction with Government colleagues to communicate the concerns of the industry about the long-term effect these issues could potentially have on the tourism sector.

There is still a lot of goodwill out there and it is crucial that we harness it. The people best placed to harness it are the Government in the decisions it makes and local Deputies and politicians in trying to support communities. We have to make sure it happens and it is real in order that when people get up tomorrow and the day after they can see it is happening. This is in the context of extra public services such as transport. I am specifically asking about supports for business. I heard what the Minister of State said about a higher budget for marketing. That is good but we also need to look at those areas that are hardest hit and there are a number of them. We need to focus on some of them. Rosses Point is not the only one in my constituency but it is the one I am discussing this evening. One person at the meeting said people need to know that Rosses Point is open for business. The only way this can happen is if we have specifically focused marketing actions to make sure people have that message. The Minister of State mentioned the TBESS. Of course all businesses get that. It is in the context of the escalating cost of energy. We need something more focused than this. That scheme is for everybody but we have to recognise the specific issues I am speaking about. I hope the 9% VAT rate will be maintained. This is important for businesses and I hope there is no cliff edge. I speak, as does the Minister of State, to many people about this issue. People are willing to help and want to help. One man from the RNLI spoke about the fact there are several hundred people who have never seen the sea and do not know there are dangerous currents. From such a simple issue as this to supporting businesses, communities need to know we are on their side.

I thank her and her colleagues for their relentless advocacy of tourism and business in Sligo and for the constructive approach they have taken on this. I am fully aware of the beautiful tourist sites in Sligo. Deputy Harkin mentioned Rosses Point in particular but she is right to say there are many others, including Knocknarea, Lough Gara and Enniscrone. I am a regular in Yeats country. There is also Mullaghmore and other beautiful places. The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is acutely conscious of the importance of the tourism sector, particularly on a regional basis. Tourism accommodation has a significant multiplier effect for other businesses in the wider area. The war in Ukraine, combined with the very high number of applicants for international protection, puts real pressure on the Government's ability to offer humanitarian accommodation. The people of Ireland have never seen so many arrive in such a short timeframe. We have welcomed the equivalent of the city of Galway in less than a year. The country has done a tremendous job collectively in doing what is the right thing but we are left dealing with the consequences of it and we trying to do it in the best possible way. Irish people have sought shelter and opportunities abroad and Ireland has a long tradition over history of helping nations in trouble. It is the right thing to do. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is availing of the wide range of offers of accommodation made to it. The Government is focused on continuing the support for those fleeing the war. It has agreed that there should be a move away from an emergency response to a more mainstreamed approach, including reduced reliance on serviced accommodation. There is now an increased focus on rapid-build housing and a new call for vacant homes led by local authorities. The Minister consistently engages with, and takes on board, the views of the hospitality and tourism sectors, particularly with regard to the need to avoid a cliff edge and the supports that are needed. She continues to do so and she will take careful note of the comments that Deputy Harkin has made. I am very grateful for them.

It is fair to say that access to appropriate healthcare is a fundamental right of all our citizens. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the huge progress being made by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his team in ensuring that we improve our health service in the face of the global pandemic. Despite significant increases in investment there still remain challenges and problems. In an ever-evolving world there always will be. This is why we need the Government to respond to these challenges. It is important that this response is done in an efficient and timely fashion. Most of us are aware of someone who suffers from cystic fibrosis and the debilitating disease it is. I compliment Cystic Fibrosis Ireland for the work it does in advocacy, supporting families and fundraising. Most of us remember that a number of years ago there was a very comprehensive campaign for the licensing of Orkambi and the huge difference that drug made to the quality of lives of so many people. I am told by the CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Ireland that a new drug, Kaftrio, is much better and makes even more of a difference to people's lives, improving their quality of life. Unfortunately there is a cohort of approximately 35 children aged between six and 12 years who are excluded from this drug because of their genotype. This is despite medical people knowing that the drug will work and greatly enhance the quality of their lives.I am aware the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, is in the process of carrying out a health technology assessment, HTA, and that the HSE has prioritised this. I thank the Minister for ensuring this was prioritised. Through the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, I ask that the Minister encourage the HSE to have this process brought to a conclusion as soon as possible and for the HSE to give a commitment not to procrastinate thereafter but to come forward with a positive decision. Every delay is causing irreparable damage to these children and potentially reducing their life expectancy. A young boy in my constituency, Ciarán Kilmurray, whose family know I am raising this issue, spoke to Joe Duffy before Christmas. Ciarán was in hospital right up until Christmas. I compliment his classmates from St. Kenny National School. They were precluded from visiting him because of his vulnerability. They did not want to put him at any greater risk so they made Ciarán a lovely video to show he was very much missed by the school. I am glad to say he is now back at school but he is sitting on his own with a mask on and cannot participate freely in school activities with his classmates. However, if he had access to this life-changing drug, he could participate. I am sharing this story with the Minister of State in the hope he will bring it back to the Minister to ensure this process is concluded without delay, that we have a positive outcome and that the 34 other children who are in a position similar to Ciarán can get access to this life-changing drug and go on to live their lives normally.

I thank Deputy Troy for raising this important issue. Kaftrio has been a life-changing drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers. Access to drugs like this was what we expected when the HSE signed its agreement with the manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, in 2017. The deal stipulated our patients would have access to Vertex's whole portfolio of cystic fibrosis drugs for a capped yearly cost. We made a ten-year commitment that has already seen us pay hundreds of millions of euro to Vertex. We entered this agreement in good faith expecting that as new licences were approved for Kaftrio's medicines, the HSE would receive access at no additional cost. This has been the case previously when new indications were licensed. The agreement was amended in 2019 and 2020 to include these patient groups at no additional cost. However, for this particular sub-type that affects a small group of children, Vertex is requesting additional funds to provide access. The HSE has statutory responsibility for the community drug schemes. It has structures in place to ensure our health service is able to provide the right care sustainably. Given the substantial budgetary impact of the additional funds sought by Vertex, it must complete the pricing and reimbursement process that is required of all other medicines. This requires the NCPE to complete a HTA of Kaftrio for this patient group. Until recently, Vertex did not engage with this process. Following extensive efforts from the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit, Vertex supplied its HTA dossier to the NCPE last month. The NCPE has agreed to treat this HTA as a priority case. The Minister is pushing to have the HTA completed as soon as possible. In the meantime, the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit continues its open dialogue with Vertex and met the company a couple of times in January. The Government is committed to providing access to innovative new medicines for Irish patients. Budgets 2021 and 2022 saw €80 million of funding dedicated to new medicines. Some 112 new medicines, or expanded uses of existing medicines, of which 34 were for the treatment of rare diseases, have been provided since 2021. I thank Cystic Fibrosis Ireland for its efforts in bringing attention to this situation. The organisation provided valuable insight to the Minister during their meetings late last year. The voices of parents and of these children have also been heard and the Minister fully appreciates their concern. He and I are hopeful this situation will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion for everyone shortly.

What is the difference for this particular sub-type? We have 35 children in this situation. I gave a personal example of one of them whose quality of life has been severely impacted by this decision. What is the rationale for this drug company not honouring a deal made a number of years ago? I welcome that a process has commenced and that the HTA will conclude very quickly. I ask that this happen within the next number of weeks, if not days, and that when that process is concluded the HSE proceeds at speed to make this drug available to this cohort of children. As I said, any delay is doing irreparable damage. If the children move onto the drug in a number of weeks, it will not be able to undo the damage that is already done, so time is of the essence. These children, like everyone else availing of this life-changing drug, deserve it. I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure the Minister continues to keep this as a priority so we can get a satisfactory conclusion in the next number of weeks, if not days.

I also acknowledge the circumstances the Deputy's constituents, Ciarán and his family, whom the Deputy spoke about in his initial remarks, find themselves in. The Minister is working on resolving this issue as a matter of high priority. He has been very clear in telling me that and it is his position and the position of the Government. It is a matter of extreme regret that Vertex has behaved in the manner it has. That being said, we are pursuing every avenue to try to remedy the situation. The HSE has a statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions given under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. This requires the executive to ensure medicines are reimbursed in a cost-effective manner. The HSE is making an effort to fulfil its responsibility. Following extensive efforts by the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit, we are now beginning to see progress in this matter. The Minister, the clinical community and, most important, the families affected are all eager to see progress towards making this drug available to these children as soon as possible.

The home care package is a service that has been a lifeline to many families throughout the length and breadth of the country. My family benefited enormously from it in times past. The work done by the care assistants who dedicate their lives to the care of others in their own home is invaluable, as is the care they give and their dedication.It would be remiss of me not to say that at the outset. At present, we face a crisis in home care and the delivery of home care services. No more than any other Deputies from all sides of this House, my constituency office is getting calls daily from people trying to get home care packages or to find home help services available for loved ones. Due to advancing years, they may want to get an increase in the hours. The home help and home care services undoubtedly have provided an enormous service to the State over the years, have been hugely beneficial and have saved the State an enormous amount of money by keeping people in their own homes for as long as possible. However, we now have a major issue. We came through the winter and many families have been scraping together to try to put together a package. We have worked with some families to try to build a package with private care and so forth because they want to keep their loved ones at home for as long as is humanly possible and are trying to do that. We have been told time out of number by the HSE and the powers that be that there is a shortage of staff. This did not happen today or yesterday, but goes back a number of months. The issue I want to raise today is what the State, the Government, the Minister and the HSE are doing to recruit more people into this area and to make the job of care assistant in the community more attractive. We have seen instances where the HSE has been contracting out hours to private companies to try to get cover but even that is proving difficult. Some of the senior HSE people are exhausted from trying to provide cover or get home help services. The HSE is then looking at the home help services in existence and is going out through the powers that be to see if they can reduce the hours for some people to spread the service more thinly on the ground. That is totally unacceptable because in some of the cases I have, families need more help for their loved one, not having it reduced because of a shortage of staff. The Government needs to be innovative about getting more people involved. The position of care assistant needs to be an attractive position and new people must be attracted into it to make sure. As we go on, it is fundamental and hugely important, given the aging population, that the home care and home help services are enhanced and strengthened because that is the only way we will be able to keep people in their own homes for as long as is possible.

Improving access to home support is a priority for the Government. Since budget 2021, the Government has provided an additional €207 million in funding for home support to the Department of Health. This year, the overall home support budget will be more than €700 million. This will enable the HSE to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services. It also will fund nearly 24 million hours of home support this year. The dementia-specific proportion of new home support hours will increase from 5% in 2021 to 15% in 2023. The delivery of a high-quality consistent home support service is a key priority for the Cork and Kerry community healthcare organisation, CHO 4, focusing on keeping people well in their homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with enhanced investment.  As of November 2022, the latest available preliminary data show in excess of €19 million hours of home support had been delivered nationally in the year to date. Within the CHO 4 area, the home support service delivered more than 2 million hours from January to November in 2022 to over 7,000 clients. At the end of November there were 56,429 people in receipt of this service nationally. There were 3,240 new applicants funded and waiting for supports while 2,819 people already were receiving supports, albeit not for the maximum hours advised. The HSE has advised us that as of the end of December, 109 people were awaiting home support in north Cork. There are strategic workforce challenges in this sector that have immediate and longer-term implications. Current difficulties in recruiting healthcare workers are already affecting the level of service provision. This has the potential to be exacerbated over time due to an aging demographic. The Government has commenced a number of initiatives to address these challenges. Last year, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler, established a strategic workforce advisory group to address the challenges of recruitment and retention of home carers and nursing home healthcare assistants. The Government has published its findings and the implementation of the advisory group's recommendations has commenced. Since January 2023, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler has also secured 1,000 employment permits, which will allow home care workers from non-EU and non-EEA countries the opportunity to work in Ireland. This is an immediate intervention to support the sector. In conjunction with wider sectoral reforms that are in train, implementation of the group's recommendations will have a real and lasting impact on addressing our workforce challenges.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health that more people than ever before are being referred for home care. Consequently, delivery of this service is not without its challenges. Cork-Kerry community healthcare is acutely aware that there are staff resource issues across both direct and indirect provision of home support in Cork and other areas. In order to bolster staff resources and reduce waiting times for the allocation of service, Cork-Kerry community healthcare advertises on an ongoing basis for health care support assistants throughout the region in an effort to recruit as many suitable candidates as possible. Approved private providers are also actively endeavouring to recruit additional staff resources. Given the nature of this role, this recruitment is normally conducted at a very local level and is ongoing across the region. The HSE has also advised that a good working relationship has been established between local hospitals and the community. Patients are regularly discharged directly home from acute settings with home support. Patients can also be offered a transitional care bed in a residential care facility until a carer can be assigned.

There are a number of issues. There are 109 people waiting for services. Is there a policy to reduce the amount of home help hours to existing people, referred to in the document as clients, so as to spread the service more thinly because of the shortage of home care assistants? Strategically, in the Minister of State's own Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, should there not be an incentive put in place to recruit people to the home care assistants courses that are offered in many of the colleges throughout the country? The Minister of State mentioned permits being brought in to help with the service and that is very welcome but there are an awful lot of people who could be recruited. Has there been co-ordination between the HSE and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, to see if a new course can be created into which people could be recruited or equally, into the existing healthcare assistant course? If we do not do something at a fundamental level, we will be back here again. I have to say, from the evidence we are getting, we see some people who are well into their 80s and maybe older and there is talk of them surviving on less hours because of the shortage. We have to stamp that out because we cannot be reducing any services that are there. In some cases we have people who are in acute hospitals or in transition beds and they are waiting. They are fit to go home and would go home if there was a home care package available. That again is contributing to the issues across the hospital services.I refer to the issue of spreading the services we have more thinly on the ground and what is being done to recruit more people at the bottom end and to make the package for a healthcare assistant more attractive.

There is no policy to reduce hours. and end-of-life care is always a priority for the Government. The Government remains committed to supporting people to age in place at home in their communities with access to wraparound supports, including day care and dementia-specific day care services, meals on wheels and home care. As I mentioned earlier, delivering this enhanced capacity for support requires substantial recruitment and significant work is under way to address the strategic workforce challenges in this regard. The HSE also continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for healthcare support assistants and recruits as many suitable candidates as possible. The Department of Health is continuing to develop a regulatory framework for providers, which will comprise primary legislation for the licensing of providers and secondary legislation in the form of regulations and HIQA national standards. The HSE has begun the recruitment process for 128 interRAI care needs facilitators to progress the national roll-out of interRAI as a standard assessment tool for care needs in the community to determine prioritisation and levels of care required. The HSE is also progressing the recruitment of several key posts to support the establishment of the national home support office. I was also recently involved in a Zoom call with the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach, and Oireachtas members from the mid-west region. This came on the back of the issue in the region. The specific issue raised by the Deputy also came up as part of that discussion and the point was correctly made that an employment regulation order is also needed for people who work as home carers. This key element is lacking in making this a viable career and option for people to go into work where they will have certainty in this regard. This point was also made on that call with the Minister and the Taoiseach and they were both accepting of it because we have done similar in the child care setting, where, as the Deputy will be aware, an employment regulation order was recently issued to give certainty to people working in that sector. The Deputy asked a specific question about my Department in this regard. It is the intention, and the Higher Education Authority has sought expressions of interest from our higher education institutions, to put on additional courses to train home care assistants and allied health professionals in this area.

They are greatly concerned that services are being moved from Ringsend and Irishtown primary care centre to the Meath Hospital. Residents are, quite frankly, dismayed by this decision. It will be a great imposition and have a major impact on them, and especially on older people. Can the Minister of State confirm that this change is going to happen and that services will be moved from Ringsend and Irishtown primary care centre to the Meath Hospital site? These services are important. Residents received letters stating that the physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions were going to be moved out of Irishtown. This is a well populated area, especially with older people, and this move will have a major impact on people. Regarding these older people, Deputy Moynihan, on the previous matter, mentioned keeping people in their homes. This move is going to fast-track people into hospital and lead to a deterioration in people's health. People are receiving these services because they already have mobility issues. There is no transport link from Ringsend and Irishtown to the Meath Hospital just off the South Circular Road. At the last general election and even at the last by-election, the Government candidate spoke about a 15-minute city. This is going to make a 15-minute city impossible because it will take two bus journeys for people to reach the Meath Hospital. When they arrive there and get off the second bus journey, they will then have to take a long walk up to the hospital. This issue is about the restricting of access. This move is restricting access for older people in Ringsend and Irishtown to community services. People are genuinely dismayed that they will have to move from a perfectly good primary healthcare centre up to the Meath Hospital. In the letters sent to residents, I noticed that these are signed off with "Building a Better Health Service". These are also signed off with a subheading referring to "care, compassion, trust and learning". None of those elements appear to apply to this decision. There certainly does not appear to have been any learning by the Government if it is going to move a perfectly good health centre, and these services therein, to the Meath Hospital. This move will have a major impact and the Government must review this decision. It should ensure, instead, that it is increasing the services in the primary healthcare centre in Ringsend and Irishtown and not reducing them. I ask the Government to act on this issue.

A central objective of the programme for Government is to deliver increased levels of integrated health care with service delivery reoriented towards general practice, primary care and community-based services to enable a home first approach. Primary care centres play an essential role in the delivery of that objective and significant progress has been made in the delivery of these centres nationally. These centres support the delivery of integrated care by facilitating closer co-ordination and co-operation among health professionals from across different disciplines. They also provide a single point of access to services for the individual and can serve as a resource more broadly for the community. There are currently 165 primary care centres operational and 12 more are scheduled to be delivered during 2023. The Irishtown and Ringsend primary care centre is one such centre facilitating a range of services, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, public health nursing, physiotherapy, psychology, dental services, general practice services and community medical doctors. The HSE has advised that there has been no specific reduction in services in the Irishtown and Ringsend primary care centre. At present, the management and oversight function for Irishtown and Ringsend primary care centre and all HSE services connected to the centre are transferring from CHO 7 to CHO 6. The HSE has assured the Department that this transition of services refers to the management of the services only and not the services themselves. The transition has commenced, and it is expected that the services currently available will continue to be delivered. In fact, the HSE has advised of plans for the addition of podiatry services to be made available to the population of Irishtown and Ringsend. Currently, unfortunately, dietetics is not provided in the area due to recruitment challenges. The Minister, however, has been assured that active recruitment measures are ongoing and that it is expected this service will soon be available. The HSE has also assured the Department that CHO 6 will continue the recruitment process for current vacancies in Irishtown and Ringsend primary care centre and that HSE management in CHO 6 will be supported by their counterparts in CHO 7 during the transfer to ensure there is a seamless transition of services, which are management services.

Clearly, though, this information has not been communicated very well.Many people in Ringsend and Irishtown received these letters and they interpreted them to mean their service would be moved to the Meath Hospital primary care centre. My understanding, and the Minister of State might correct me, is that the files and records will be kept and stored in the Meath Hospital but the services, including additional services, will be at the primary care centre in Irishtown and Ringsend. Is that a fair analysis? Clearly, this is a huge catchment area for people who need these services. These services are vital to keeping people at home. Ringsend and Irishtown are home to a large pool of people who need these services, and they are vital to ensuring the community stays together, stays active and stays engaged. As stated, the idea that people would have to move out of Ringsend and Irishtown for these services is madness. It is positive to hear that services will be increased and that they will be delivered on site.

This is a motion on the Joint Committee on Autism's report on the summer programme for 2023. There were a number of recommendations in the report. I will speak specifically to one and I suppose some Members will take others. The report recommends:That the Department of education expands the range of professions that may participate in the summer programme to include the following:- Child psychologists- Speech and Language Therapists- Occupational Therapists- Early childcare workers- Third level students in the final two years of their programme in education, Psychology, Therapy (such as Occupational Therapy and Speech and Language Therapy), Nursing and Medicine.We are very lucky that the committee is very committed to what it is doing but also because it is very apolitical. We are all on this committee because we care. The idea behind this programme was that we wanted to do things right and improve things. We have listened to many witness statements and the testimony of family members. Even during the very short course of this committee, I have learned a lot about people who have educational needs, challenging needs and so on and so forth. I appeal to the Minister of State to take this report on board and have a look at the recommendations we have come up with. It is not to put pressure on services. We want to improve the services and enhance them. The instant reaction to that is that children and families would have a better time at school but it would also stop the regression when students and families cannot access the summer school. In my town of Midleton, there is a lady who has been volunteering for 25 or 26 years now. She started off with 20 pupils 25 years ago. She has maybe 250 children now who she does a summer school with every year. There are something like 360 volunteers, who are all kids. My own children did it. It was heartbreaking when they were not allowed volunteer anymore. There is an immense sense of pride in every community and we should have pride in every single person in that community. When people are less advantaged and we have an opportunity to improve their lives, this is what we should do. We are starting at an early age. It is like everything. This will only enhance the services in any town or village in the country. I want to move this report forward. I am conscious of the number of speakers waiting to contribute, so I will hand over to Senator Carrigy.

I also thank it for proposing, and the Dáil for agreeing, that I, as a Senator and Chair of the Joint Committee on Autism, could attend and be heard during these proceedings. I thank my fellow members on the committee for the work they have put into this report and Deputy Buckley, who sponsored the motion. The Joint Committee on Autism held its first public meeting on the 28 June last year. It was established with a view to producing its final report at the end of March this year. However, it became very clear when we began our public meetings in June of last year that education matters, and particularly those relating to the summer programme, required urgent attention from the Government. At our very first public meetings, we considered the issue of education. As we engaged with stakeholders in the education sector, we received more and more correspondence from parents who could not access a place in the summer programme and from parents who could not even access a place in a school. Throughout the course of our public meetings, we received harrowing testimonies from families who have been failed by the education system. We have been privileged to welcome a number of families to speak before the committee - families who have fought tirelessly on behalf of their children and, indeed, their wider families. They have founded campaign groups, established support networks and provided information to families who find themselves facing the same challenges they did when trying to access services. The work these parents have done cannot be underestimated but it is work they should not have to do. Parents should not have to organise campaigns to convince the State to provide adequate places within the school programme. We should not have to fight to access school classrooms. The report on the summer programme 2023 emerged in no small part due to the efforts of these parents and many others across Ireland. They should be commended on their tireless work in difficult circumstances. This interim report was undertaken in the context of the clear failings we identified with the summer programme in 2021 and 2022. Figures from the Department of Education show that 80% of children in special schools had no access to the summer programme in 2021. That same year, fewer than 5% of children in special schools got the full four weeks. It is unacceptable that the very children for whom the programme was established are now excluded from participating in it. I note that a number of schools sent correspondence to families last summer stating they would not be participating in the programme in summer 2023. I am aware that forward planning and good organisation are central to providing a successful school programme. It is with this in mind that we published this interim report several months in advance of the committee's final report. We published it with the intention of giving the opportunity to the Minister and the Department of Education to ensure that adequate resources and supports are in place for schools to provide the summer programme for the children who need and deserve it. I referred to the contributions made by the parents of autistic children. Parents discussed a range of issues that arise when a school-based summer programme is not made available to a child who relies on it. The interruption to an autistic child's routine can have catastrophic results for that child and their family. The report details the regression children with autism can experience during the summer holidays. Indeed, neurotypical children experience educational regression during the summer period. However, children with ASD and other forms of special educational needs experience regression to a greater extent than their peers. One of the traits that is sometimes associated with autism is a difficulty in acquiring and maintaining skills. A long period of interruption for an autistic child will greatly impact upon the skills they had acquired due to the efforts of themselves, their teachers, their SNAs and their parents. This is the fundamental premise upon which the summer programme is based. As many Deputies will be aware, the programme emerged from a court ruling that children with special educational needs experience regression and that they have a right to an education. The very reason the summer programme was initiated was to mitigate this regression. This behavioural regression is one of many sources of stress experienced by families as a result of their inability to access a school-based summer programme. Parents have related heartbreaking stories about the pressure and stress their families are subjected to as a result of this regression. It is incredibly difficult for families to witness self-injurious behaviours, anxiety and anger in their children. Research has shown that the parents of children with ASD experience more stress before their child is diagnosed as they ask why their child is not developing in the way they would have expected.Parents experience stress when they learn about their child's diagnosis and how they will be supported. Parents also experience stress when they try to access the services their children need - assessment of need, school places and healthcare. Campaigning for adequate services for autistic children is an additional source of stress that, unfortunately, the parents of autistic children have also had to reckon with in recent years. One of the benefits that the programme can provide to families is respite. Respite is a lifeline for parents who are in the most difficult of circumstances. Children with ASC, autism spectrum condition, can have very high care needs and parents can find themselves as the sole providers of care for their child. Deputies will be aware of the difficulty experienced by many families in accessing respite care, whether publicly or privately. As mentioned in the report, the programme is sometimes the only form of respite available to some parents. Importantly, this respite does not just benefit parents, but entire families. Many parents find themselves directing a lot more attention to their child or children with higher care needs and sometimes feel guilty for being unable to give as much attention to their other children as they would like. Additionally, some children, who are also on their holidays during this period, find themselves caring for their siblings. Care is extremely stressful and difficult work. We should not rely on children to provide it to those who require it. For many, care is unpaid work. Parents have related that in the absence of the programme in their area, they have taken unpaid leave to look after their children. In the current economic climate when costs are rising, and many families are worrying about expenses, we cannot expect families to endure an increased financial burden over the summer months. At a recent meeting of the committee, we heard from Dr. Áine Roddy of the Atlantic Technological University, ATU. She states that the average annual cost for having a child with autism is in excess of €28,000. She advised that these costs relate to private services, lost income and informal care. The absence of this vital public service contributes to families incurring costs, and in some cases debt, to access interventions and respite care privately, and it contributes to a loss of income due to the necessity to take unpaid leave. The State cannot expect families to bear the burden of these expenses. The most cost-effective way for the State to intervene in this situation that emerges every summer is to provide a comprehensive summer programme with the funding that is available and to relieve a major source of stress and anxiety for parents. It is important to acknowledge the funding that has been made available by the Government for the summer programme in recent years, more than €40 million in 2022. I welcome the announcement prior to Christmas by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, that €40 million is available for the programme for 2023. I acknowledge the significant work that she has done to provide school places for children around the country. We feel strongly as a committee that we must make a change in the summer programme. We must get more schools on board. There is a responsibility, in particular on the special schools and the principals of special schools. I acknowledge the hard work that they do throughout the year and have done for many years, but we must think of the child first. We must put these recommendations in place to make sure that more than 40 of the 136 special schools we have in this country have school-based programmes this year and that we do not have a situation where more than 6,500 children with the highest needs, the children for whom we set up the summer programme, do not receive it. For these reasons, I strongly encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to accept the recommendations. I accept that a lot of work has been done in this area in recent months to adopt and implement the recommendations as outlined in the report.

It has been a particular focus for me as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion. In fact, I have had the pleasure of visiting many of the summer programmes and have seen at first hand the immeasurable difference this programme makes to children with special educational needs and those experiencing educational disadvantage. The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for the Government and my main focus, as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion. I am determined to ensure continuous development of special education provision and policy to allow all children achieve the best possible outcomes in their lives. The summer programme is a very important scheme for pupils with special educational needs and those at great educational disadvantage. I very much want to see it supporting families and students with special educational needs during the summer months. I thank all the members of the committee, especially the Chair, Senator Carrigy, and Deputy Buckley, who sponsored today's motion, for their dedication, commitment and hard work. It is important first to reflect on the significant progress the summer programme has made in recent years. I want to highlight how numbers have grown since 2019, with 2022 seeing more schools and students participate than ever before. More than 42,000 pupils benefited last year, with more than 1,000 schools running a programme. That was an increase of 20% compared to 2021. If we compare that again to the 2019 figures, when it catered for just 13,000, the numbers have grown by more than 300%. I am not saying there is not more to do, but I am just showing that there has been progress to date. As Members can see, the scale of the project has grown significantly in a short period and as a result so has the level of planning needed. It has helped more than 1,000 Ukrainian children to integrate into their new learning environments through last summer's programme. I understand the importance of this crucial scheme for families and the children who participate in it. I am very conscious that summer can be a daunting time for the families of children with additional needs, and for some children who do not have enough interaction with friends and peers. I very much welcome the contribution made by the Joint Committee on Autism through its recent report on the summer programme. I again thank all of the committee members for their work, the Chairman, Senator Carrigy, and Deputy Buckley, for sponsoring the motion. The committee has been involved in a lot of work around the country helping people with autism. I am in agreement with the report and I am committed to addressing the recommendations of the November 2022 report by the joint committee. My Department has also been preparing intensively for 2023 since last summer. I am delighted that the recommendations align with and support how we have been developing the programme. To start, the additional €20 million funding required for next year's programme was approved in budget 2023, bringing the total to €40 million for 2023. My Department has conducted a review of the summer programme to ensure that we can build on the success of recent years. As part of this review, my Department took a very proactive approach and developed the 2023 programme based on this review and other forms of feedback including engagement with parents, advocacy groups, schools and management bodies with a view to encouraging more schools to participate this year. Department officials met with the principals of special schools in meetings around the country. It is very important that such engagement happens. They also met with officials from Malta on two occasions to utilise some of the learning from its system in the planning and organisation. It was also identified that a particular focus on special schools was needed in 2023 to ensure additional supports are made available to help them run a programme. The inspectorate in the Department has also visited schools, including special schools, as part of that process, and is liaising with staff, parents and the children who participated to help ensure that the review takes account of the lived experience. The terms of the 2023 programme are being implemented following this comprehensive review and engagement with education partners and stakeholders since last summer, including the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Autism. I believe people will see the hard work my Department has done to develop this year's programme, and that we have listened to all stakeholders. I hope this will increase the number of schools offering the programme and the number of eligible children participating. This year introduces a new theme for the summer programme, Building Confidence and Connections. The primary aim of this theme is to help children and young people to realise their potential, to be resilient in dealing with the normal stresses of their lives, to take care of their physical well-being and to have a sense of purpose, connection and belonging to their school community. All schools are encouraged to design their programme around this theme. Guidance and training material will be provided to schools to help them with this process. The summer programme is intended to be an enjoyable experience, and it always is, for both pupils and staff. The range of activities should reflect this year's theme and include opportunities for pupil-centred, play-based engagement.This year, all primary school, special school and post-primary programmes will be able to provide a summer programme as well. DEIS numeracy and literacy camps, campaí samhraidh, are also still available in DEIS primary schools. They are very important too. A home-based summer programme was also available for up to four weeks, with ten hours per week for students with complex special educational needs, where a place on a school-based programme was not available to them. However, a major focus this year is that those children with the most complex needs, especially in special schools, should have access to a school-based summer programme. That is what we want. This year will see the introduction of a new pilot programme in special schools, which is good. It will be supported by a new national co-ordinator. That will bring a new focus to supporting and further engaging with these schools to help more special schools engage with the programme to support students in their schools during the summer period. However, my Department also hopes to increase the number of all schools offering the summer programme. Additional steps will be provided to support schools, including support to ease the burden of administration, access to additional workforce availability and, importantly, a new leadership role in schools. This leadership will be available to schools when the details of the programme are announced and this role will be a support for schools with planning and preparation for their own programmes. Graduate and student teachers can work on the summer programme where they have commenced the registration process with the Teaching Council and certain conditions are fulfilled. Schools will have the flexibility to engage staff who are not currently employed in their schools, including those in the early years and youth sectors or carers to run their summer programme. Other examples of which schools have previously successfully availed include students from therapy, nursing or other healthcare-related disciplines. These will also be supported this year in special schools. Other enhanced measures from last year will continue to encourage schools' participation, including a centralised application process to reduce the administrative burden on schools, earlier payment of school staff and an additional capitation to cover the running costs of the scheme, as well as enhanced capitation for special schools. Last summer, for the first time, schools were able to submit the details of staff who worked on their programme through an online portal. The first payments issued in July and continued throughout the summer. More than 9,000 staff members were paid by the end of September for their participation in the school-based programme. That was of use from the feedback we had in previous years.  Members will no doubt have seen our announcement last October about this year's programme. The early announcement for 2023 and the further publication of terms for this year's programme in the coming days will afford schools every opportunity and several extra months to plan for this year's summer programme. I reiterate my commitment to ensuring that the children who need it most have access to this important education initiative. My officials and I will work very hard to see this achieved. I very much look forward to hearing statements from the Members.

I have to drive. Deputy Lowry was to be here but, unfortunately, he had to go home for a funeral. I wish to record that first. I thank the Joint Committee on Autism for bringing forward this motion. I thank Deputy Buckley for sponsoring it and Senator Carrigy for his introduction. Members of the committee have seen this first hand. I note some of them are here, including the Chair, Deputy Michael Moynihan, to discuss this very important issue. A parent of a child told me not too long ago, when I was talking to her about the child, that autism is not a disability, but a different ability. We have to educate ourselves on that. It is a different ability. I welcome the report from the committee. It might set a precedent in that it has come earlier than expected. That is important because, as Senator Carrigy noted, the plan for the summer must be put in place early in order that we can ensure the children who need the summer programme get every opportunity to participate in it. The idea of combining resources from schools to have at least one summer programme in each town or locality is a common sense. We need to pool resources and make sure all the services are in place. Planning for that should begin now. The Minister of State mentioned there has been an increase in the number of services. That is to be commended and welcomed, but we still have people who fall between the cracks during the summer. We heard at first hand from witnesses at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters that families suffered badly during Covid and all that went with it. They have been in a very stressful situation for a long time. We owe it to all families who wish to avail of the summer programme to have a facility available to them. We need to make sure families have certainty about what will happen in good time in order that they can plan their summer and family outings. I have taken autism on board because I have some relations who have children with autism. I find it great fun talking to them but we should also be doing significant work for children with autism. That motivated me to reintroduce a Bill that the former Minister, Dr. James Reilly, had passed in the Seanad. When I introduced it in the Dáil in October 2021 the Government did not oppose it but asked us to put a stay on it for one year. In October 2022, the Bill passed Second Stage. It is now with the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is chaired by Deputy Funchion. Some members of the committee are examining whether they need to do scrutiny on the Bill. I have reached out to the committee for a meeting. In that regard, I commend Deputy Funchion. We will have a meeting to discuss how we can progress that Bill as soon as possible, for the simple reason it has been passed in the Seanad and has completed Second Stage in the Dáil. Amendments are obviously required, and we have amendments prepared, but it is important that we enact this legislation which will give power to people and children with autism and have a right enshrined in law. That is important. The Joint Committee on Autism has done considerable work and rightly so. It will continue to do that work for some months. Without tangible results, that work will be a futile exercise, no more than our own work on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters will be. It is vital we have the discussion on summer provision now, in February, rather than having it in May or June in order that families get certainty. Deputy Moynihan chaired the meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this morning. One gets so much information from people, but families have to come out in public and more or less tell us all of their private experiences. It is a bit demoralising that they have to do so. Some of them do it with great courage and conviction, but we are at a stage in society where we should not have to put people through that. We should have a better understanding ourselves, as elected public representatives, of what is going on.  A mother said to me that this is not a disability but a different ability and that got me thinking in different way about autism, about how we should embrace it and embrace the people who have it. They are precious but they are also very much part of our society and we need to make them equal. The summer provision is a little part of the overall number of cogs that we have to make sure they have a life of fulfilment and engagement and can contribute to society. The families who have appeared before our committee and the autism committee are contributing to society. They are contributing to the future of society for the betterment of everyone by being courageous enough to come in and speak to us. We owe it to them to make sure that we have a good summer offering for them. I have no doubt that will happen but it is important that we start the work now. We must do the necessary preplanning and make sure that any glitches or hitches are sorted out in time so that families can look forward to the summer with enthusiasm and peace of mind and young people can enjoy the summer, because that is what it is all about.

This Oireachtas joint committee was set up specifically to look at autism. I welcome its Chair, Senator Carrigy, to the House and I welcome the committee's report. Senator Carrigy pointed out that the committee has had ten public meetings thus far and the summer programme has arisen consistently as a major issue and a source of frustration for autistic people and their families in many of these meetings. That is also our experience as Deputies and Senators. Senator Carrigy spoke about the powerful contributions at those meetings and highlighted the urgent need for action to ensure that no autistic child is left without a place in their local area in the summer programme of 2023. The summer programme, formerly known as July provision, came into being because a family had to take the State to court to get it established. It is important to remember that. This is all contained in the foreword to the committee's report. The committee felt it was very important that there would be a debate here in this Chamber and requested that the issues raised in the report and its recommendations be the subject of a debate and action in both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is what is happening now but the background to this is that those on the ground, struggling to cope with various levels of ability among their children, had to put pressure on the committee to ensure that this would happen. We have to keep that in mind all of the time when we stand up here and read from reports.  What were the key issues raised? For the record, one of the key issues was regression over the summer holiday period. It is extremely important to point out that people with serious disabilities need ongoing attendance at different types of school venues and when summer provision fails them, there is regression. This is very upsetting. Another key issue is the strain on carers and families caused by delays in schools confirming participation in the summer programme. The expansion of the cohort to whom the summer programme is available also arose as an issue which especially affected those pupils most in need. The expansion of the programme has meant that those most in need are not having their needs met. It is very important that we say this and look at it more closely. Staffing for the summer programme has been a continuous problem. There is a need for incentives for teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to participate in the programme. Other issues include the time allocation for schools to arrange the summer programme, the refusal of some schools to provide the programme, funding and the allocation of same.  All of these issues were teased out at the committee. I want to put some meat on that from a human perspective. As has been outlined, the committee heard powerful contributions from witnesses representing various groups and individuals. I will quote Ms Miriam Jennings, one such witness:The first thing I would say is that I think everybody here is a very reluctant advocate. We certainly would not choose to be here but we come here because this is our lived experience.She also stated "We believe, however, that our children's need for a school-based summer programme was not safeguarded." That is very important because the programme was set up for a particular group of people with particular disabilities but when it was expanded, that group lost out. It is important that we highlight that and confirm that it will not happen this year. Ms Jennings argued that no plan was put in place to ensure that complex-needs children, for whom the scheme was set up, would access it and gave some figures to illustrate her point. Witnesses also expressed their views on home-based tuition, to which the Minister of State referred. While that may well be positive for some families, I want to refer to what some witnesses said in relation to it. They expressed their views on the provision of home-based tuition rather than an in-school summer programme and representatives were united in arguing that the home-based programme falls considerably short of what is required by children with complex needs. At the same meeting, Ms Sarah Murphy, representing special needs schools and classes, stated: The Department states all the time that one can get a home-based tutor if one cannot get the July provision in school. However, there is so much about being in school, such as getting on the bus and all the minutiae of life that is important to people, both children and adults, who do not really understand because they do not have the intellectual capacity. We build this life for them that they can enjoy and that they can progress in but we have to do it within the boundaries of what works, so introducing lots of new things like a tutor, for example, for home-based provision does not work ...The point is that home-schooling is trotted out but it is not the answer for a substantial number of children with special needs. The conclusions of the committee's brief interim report are interesting. This is an interim report and the committee will continue its work, as I understand it. The committee decided to publish an interim report because of the concerns of all its members that everything be put in place for this summer so that we learn from what has been going on over the last few years. I appreciate the efforts of the Department and the Minister of State in relation to reviews but they have not got to grips with the problem that the programme was extended beyond the remit of those for whom it was developed, based on a legal case. I am delighted that the programme can be extended for other deserving cases but we must not lose sight of its necessity for children with complex needs. The conclusion of the report reads thus: This brief interim report provides an outline of the rationale behind the action taken by the Joint Committee on Autism in adopting this resolution. The basis for this short report is the urgency of the situation in respect of the Summer Programme 2023, which is referenced in the opening lines...this report draws on the work of the Joint Committee on Autism and the contributions of the witnesses to its work. Moreover, it identifies the origins of the Summer Programme and its essential importance for autistic children and their families. The committee makes eight recommendations and I ask the Minister to outline in her concluding remarks how many of them have been taken on board by the Department. I did not have her opening statement in front of me when she spoke earlier. Had I obtained a copy, I might have been in a better position to identify which ones have been taken on board. She spoke about a liaison officer and that would seem to represent progress on one of the recommendations. In the time left to me, it is important that I put the recommendations on record. The first is that, "notwithstanding the positive aspects of expanding the cohort of pupils that may participate in the Summer Programme, priority access to a school-based Summer Programme be given to those with conditions which place them most at risk of regression". The second is that "the Department of Education establishes a dedicated liaison team to provide information and assistance to school boards of management". The committee also recommends that the Department "liaises closely with the boards of management...establishes a protocol whereby the resources of schools can be pooled together...engages with the relevant teachers' and special needs assistants' trade unions to identify and resolve any pay anomalies and any delays in making payment to staff". That seems a most basic requirement - the necessity that staff would get paid on time. The committee also recommends that the Department "expands the range of professions that may participate in the Summer Programme" to include child psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, early childcare workers and very importantly, third level students in the final two years of programmes in education, psychology, and therapies such as occupational and speech and language therapy, nursing and medicine. The final two recommendations state:That the Department of Education engages with the relevant regulators for the above-named professions and advise them of the opportunities to participate in the Summer Programme. That the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Garda National Vetting Bureau, resolve any difficulties with vetted staff working in different schools to provide the Summer Programme, while prioritising the safety of children and vulnerable persons.  This is the time to get it right. This is an interim report pending a fuller one. It has clear recommendations, conclusions and identification of the issues on the back of families who are struggling heroically to raise children with a complex range of disabilities as normally as possible. We have the money and the expertise but we also have families who are appealing to us to do it right this year.

I am due to attend the National Diversity and Inclusion Awards in Croke Park later this evening. It is due to start at 6.30 p.m. My one ask is that undergraduates completing third or fourth year of their qualification in occupational therapy, speech and language therapy or physiotherapy be included in the summer programme, which has replaced July provision. They can be Garda vetted. They are going elsewhere for experience but they could get real-life experience within the summer programme. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that happens. Deputy Connolly referred to Garda vetting and that needs to be a priority but there are many people at college who could be paid to work on the summer provision programme. It would be valuable work experience for them and it would help us to ensure there is provision for kids who need it during the summer.  I compliment the committee members on their dedication and the work they have done in a short time. The more we speak about this across parties and at all committees, the more we can do for people with disabilities. I commend the report to the House. I thank Deputy Tully for allowing me in.
#PaulineTully	unknown-#PaulineTully-party	unknown-#PaulineTully-dob	unknown-#PaulineTully-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	430	No problem. I welcome the report of the committee and its recommendations in respect of the summer programme for 2023. I commend the Chair of the committee, as well as my fellow members. We met many groups and parents who have lived experience of the programme. They told us of the devastation they experienced when their child did not get access to summer provision. The July provision scheme was established following a High Court ruling in 1993 which set down that children with additional educational need have a right to education and it was established that children with autism and additional educational need experience regression in the summer months. The aim of the scheme was to provide an extended school year for these children so as to reduce potential regression in learning during the summer holidays. The programme was only offered in special schools and schools with special classes. Where an eligible child's school was not offering a programme, funding was provided for parents to engage a teacher to provide tuition in the child's home. When it was replaced by summer provision and the expanded programme, it was opened up to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary levels. The expansion in eligibility resulted in an increase from 15,000 children in 2019 to 80,000 in 2021. Notwithstanding the positive aspects of expanding the cohort of pupils eligible to participate in the summer programme, no plans were put in place to ensure the children most in need of the programme would retain access to it. The expansion of the programme meant that special schools and schools with special classes had to compete with the additional primary and post-primary DEIS schools for teachers and SNAs. Many teachers and SNAs opt to take part in the home-based programme. That causes additional problems as it reduces even further the pool from which special schools and schools with special classes recruit staff to deliver the programme. This has resulted in many special schools and schools with special classes struggling to find staff for the programme, with the result that many of them have stopped delivering it or reduced the period for which they run it.  Priority access must be given to those with conditions that place them most at risk of regression during the summer recess period, and it must be a school-based programme. Department of Education figures from 2021 show that 80% of children in special schools have no access to the programme and less than 5% of the 8,000 children in special schools got the full recommended four weeks. Priority access to the school-based programme is essential for these children as such a programme provides an opportunity for them to be part of a world outside their home and it gives them access to school facilities such as sensory and occupational therapy rooms and secure play areas. The home-based programme promoted by the Department is not an appropriate alternative for children with autism and additional educational needs. The NCSE has stated it is the least effective way to deliver the programme, given that many children with autism and intellectual disabilities cannot cope with and will not tolerate strangers in their home environment. Information, communication and assistance to parents, school management and staff are also key to addressing issues that would inhibit the ability of schools to proceed with a comprehensive school-based summer programme in 2023. This should include the establishment of a dedicated school liaison team. If that is happening, I welcome it. That person or team could provide information and assistance to school management and staff in providing the programme. The issuing of guidelines as early as possible is crucial. That was cited by schools in previous years as the reason they decided not to participate in the programme. Early engagement with trade unions is needed to identify and resolve any pay anomalies or delays in making payment to staff, which have previously prevented some personnel from taking part. I have heard of SNAs not receiving payment until December after working for a number of weeks during the summer. Parents must be kept abreast of new and changing information and the application process must be user-friendly, with assistance in place if needed. The range of professions eligible for employment in the programme must be extended. It should be open to a range of multidisciplinary professionals, students and trainees, including nurses, doctors, child psychologists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, early childcare workers and respite workers. This approach benefits not only the children but also the professionals, who would gain valuable experience. Protocols to pool schools' resources should be put in place to ensure the programme is available in at least one school in each large town.  The Department of Education, in conjunction with the Garda National Vetting Bureau, needs to resolve any difficulties with vetted staff working in different schools to provide the summer programme. Sinn Féin brought forward the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) (Amendment) Bill 2022 which would assist in this regard as it sets out to provide a register of generalised consents, which can help in situations where multiple vetting applications would otherwise have to be made. It would allow an individual to apply for inclusion on this register and allow multiple organisations to vet the individual in question without the full process having to be completed every time. To summarise, the most important points are that priority is given to children most in need and that it is made certain that these children have access to the school-based programme. An issue of which I was made aware today that may impact on the delivery of the school programme is that the Department of Education is proposing key changes to professional development courses which are undertaken by primary school teachers outside of school time. The Department has set out that all online courses must contain eight hours of real-time learning. If this goes ahead, the changes may have a knock-on impact on the delivery of summer provision programmes because many teachers will no longer be in a position to support the programme as they will be completing their professional development courses. There was no consultation with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, on this. There was no suggestion, or even possibility, of looking at it on a pilot basis and there has been no research produced as evidence to support and ground such changes in the summer course delivery. There is a need for joined-up thinking. We need to make sure the maximum number of teachers, SNAs and other staff are available to take part in the summer programme so that the children who most need it are able to access it.

I welcome the report on the summer programme produced by the committee.From her work, the Minister of State will be aware of the background and details of many of the parents and groups, and she will have heard their testimonies at the committee hearings last year on the July provision, or lack thereof. Many of those who needed provision most did not get it. The committee highlighted the urgent need to ensure no autistic child is left without a place in 2023. It agreed that because of the impact on the lives of persons with autism and their families, including the regression and chaos, it was necessary to produce an interim report last November. Many parents had to take unpaid leave last year, which had a major impact on their already stretched incomes. It is now three months since the report was produced, so it is wise to get an update on where the recommendations stand and ensure problems concerning the implementation of the summer programme will be resolved in the next two to three months. Some schools have stated in advance that they will not be providing the programme in 2023. The Department of Education's figures for 2021 show 80% of children in special schools had no access to the programme, while fewer than 5% of the 8,000 children in special needs schools got the full four weeks recommended. The committee felt it had a duty of care to children and their families, such that this would not be repeated. We know what the key issues are. They have been read out already but it is important to go back over them very briefly. They include regression over the summer holiday period; strain on carers and their families; delays in schools confirming participation in the programme; the expansion of the cohort to whom the summer programme is available and targeting pupils most in need of the service; staffing for the summer programme; the need for incentives for teachers and special needs assistants to participate in the programme and for broadening out; the time allocation for schools to arrange for the provision of a summer programme and the supporting of the schools in advance; the refusal of schools to offer the summer programme; ensuring funding available for the programme is available; and the allocation of funding to schools for the programme. The Minister of State made a point on liaison officers. Will she expand on that when wrapping up? She said 9,000 people working in the summer programme last year got paid by September. The work was done in July. I cannot understand how it takes two months to get paid. Many teachers are not on contracts and generally try to work during the summer, or else they go on social welfare during the summer because they do not get paid. If they do the work and are not paid until September, October, November or December, as Deputy Tully outlined, it has to be addressed. All of these issues have to be ironed out to convince people to get involved in the programme and so they will know they will get paid within two to three weeks. I want to ask the Minister of State about the recommendations. The first is, "That, notwithstanding the positive aspects of expanding the cohort of pupils that may participate in the Summer Programme, priority access to a school-based Summer Programme be given to those with conditions which place them most at risk of regression during the summer recess period, such as Autism Spectrum Condition." Will the Minister of State tell us how many special schools have committed at this stage to offering a summer programme to the children? We need to find out this detail. The second recommendation is "That the Department of Education establishes a dedicated liaison team to provide information". The Minister of State said this has not been set up. Maybe the committee could get a report, although probably not tonight, on the schools the liaison officers have attended and the feedback. The third recommendation is "That the Department of Education liaises closely with the boards of management of special schools to identify and address any issues that would inhibit their ability to proceed with a comprehensive, school-based Summer Programme". Maybe a report could be provided to the committee – again, not here – on whether this has happened. Are there problems? Are there indications that special schools cannot deliver on the programme? What needs to be done to assist such schools? The fourth recommendation is, "That the Department of Education establish a protocol whereby the resources of schools can be pooled together to ensure that the Summer Programme is made available in at least one school in every large town in the State." That is very important. The resources should be put into the schools but, if they cannot be, the inspectors and liaison officers should know immediately that they must consider the general area and try to get at least one or two schools on board to offer the programme. The fifth recommendation is, "That the Department of Education engages with the relevant teachers' and special needs assistants' trade unions to identify and resolve any pay anomalies and any delays in making payment to staff." Will the Minister of State revert to us and state she has in place a HR programme that can allow for the making of payments within two or three weeks to those who work in the programme? That would be a huge boost. It would probably get many of the teachers who are not on permanent contracts and who look for work during the summer to buy into the programme. That would be very important. The sixth recommendation is that the Department of Education should expand the range of professions that may participate in the summer programme to include the likes of child psychologists and speech and language therapists. Will the Minister of State give us an update on that? Has this been approached in respect of children's disability network team members and other workers such as those in occupational therapy and early childhood care, particularly third level students in the final two years? There has been a discussion with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on how third level students could play a crucial role in supporting the summer programme. It would give them great educational experience. The seventh recommendation is, "That the Department of Education engages with the relevant regulators for the above-named professions and advise them of the opportunities to participate in the Summer Programme". Again, if the Minister of State cannot give us the information tonight, she might let the committee know in the next week or so whether engagement with the universities has started. The eighth recommendation is "That the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Garda National Vetting Bureau, resolve any difficulties with vetted staff working in different schools". That is key. Those concerned should nearly be encouraged now to start. If you are working in one school, you do not need to be revetted to work in a different one. Complications come with that. These are the sorts of details we need to see coming through this month. We need to see things tied down in April and early May. Will the Minister of State revert to me on these points tonight if she has the information? If not, will she do so in writing?

I thank all the members of the committee for the work they have done. In particular, I thank them for the room they have made for me. From time to time, I might have overstepped the line regarding the speaking time I took. I will try not to do that today. The point of having an autism committee is similar to the one mentioned by Deputy Canney, that is, to ensure we create a space for autistic people that allows for genuine equality and acceptance. We all know of the autism services that are not being provided. Many have spoken about the added cost to parents of autistic children, namely €28,000 per year. We are talking about expanding summer provision with speech and language therapists, psychologists and occupational therapists. We realise these resources are not where we need them. Therefore, a huge body of work needs to be done. There have been major failings across the board. The expansion of summer provision, while beneficial to some, obviously created a difficulty. In fairness, decent work is being done by the committee in setting out straightforward recommendations. I do not believe there is anyone in this room or beyond who could keep a straight face while arguing against them. I welcome some of what the Minister of State said about the review.We just need to make sure the review meets these recommendations and that this service is provided to the children who most need it and who are most in danger of regression. That should be their absolute right within a school setting. We will have to make sure that all of the engagement happens and that we deal with pay and conditions, any anomalies that are created and all the stakeholders. I refer to the schools, the Department and right down to the unions and every individual person. We need to ensure that is done and dusted. I will be quite honest. My experience of summer provision has been really good. My son, Turlough, who is autistic, got home-based provision for a number of years with two really good teachers. He was then able to get provision in a school setting in St. Joseph's National School. That is even better. It is really beneficial, although it is not without difficulties. From time to time, kids like our Turlough can create huge logistical issues. I had to attend to a constituency issue this morning. I usually miss these things but it became my responsibility to ensure Turlough got to school. I cannot say I got him to school on time. I got him there and I was very frustrated at the end of it. I just about made my first engagement but that might say more about me than it does about Turlough. We all get the difficulties involved but summer provision is really positive and really necessary. We need to make sure it is delivered in the correct setting to those who most need it. We may have to expand the pool of people who can deliver this programme, perhaps to those studying occupational therapy, those who will work in childcare and those studying speech and language therapy. I would like to think a considerable number of people will go through such training in the near future. That needs to happen. I hope the Minister of State will answer the questions. I will not go through the recommendations again, which are straightforward. The report is a really decent piece of work. I would like to think that the review and the engagement with stakeholders will come up with something very similar, that these things will almost merge and that we can deliver this service, which is required. If Turlough were here now, he would be able to give a much better endorsement than I have. He would probably be far more eloquent as well.  Given that we are under a time constraint, I will move on. I assume the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach will have no difficulty with this, and I hope the Minister of State will not either, but I might deviate slightly. Unfortunately, because of my constituency engagements, Deputies Tully and Ó Laoghaire were required to step into the breach with the Minister of State for me today. We were dealing with the rapid prompting method, RPM, used with autistic people who are non-verbal. The Minister of State met with Fiacre Ryan and his mam, Carmel. I know that she will have been highly impressed, just as I was, with what RPM has done for Fiacre and his family. There is an ask with regard to a pilot scheme and research so that we could look at RPM and any other assistive technologies necessary to facilitate autistic people, particularly those who are non-verbal, for whom many of us would have thought there was unfortunately no help available. We have seen huge strides made in freeing people from what must have been a trap for many over many years. I welcome what the Minister of State said about it not being prohibited for any school to engage in this but we have to do some work on it. I would appreciate it if she would give an answer to that, along with the answers relating to this piece of work. I hope that these recommendations and the conclusions of the Minister of State's review will be the same and that we can deliver the summer provision that a number of our citizens require.

I can only imagine the number of issues the committee must be dealing with, given the delays in assessment, accessing therapies and everything, so it is great to see such a comprehensive report. It is always great when there is cross-party co-operation and engagement on a committee. I will focus on three key areas. One is the expansion of the programme to as many students as possible. Some access summer provision in a home setting but my experience is mainly with people accessing it in a school setting and who find it excellent. Access is the key. If children qualify, can they find a space? As has been said by others, home support is given if they cannot get into a school space but the school setting is the best environment for the children and parents alike. It allows the children's routine to continue and prevents regression. It is just different for a lot of kids to be in their own home environment. School presents a different environment. It is good to continue in that setting.  I apologise but I missed the start of the Minister of State's speech. Did she say whether any of these recommendations will be implemented for this summer? We are just into February. We all know that time flies and that, before we know it, we will be into the summer of 2023. I apologise if I missed such a commitment being made but I hope that is what we will see. My second point is on something Deputy Tully touched on, which is expanding the pool of staff. We need to get a bit more creative in increasing the pool of staff we could tap into. It may not have to only be teachers and SNAs. I do not mean to take away from the very good work they do but we need to start looking at staffing because it is clearly an issue. There is also the matter of the time allocated for the programme. The maximum time should be given. From all of the studies and research, and anecdotally from parents, we know that children do best when they are in that routine and in that space. Over the years, and particularly during the Covid pandemic, a number of special schools have had significant issues preventing them from providing the programme. Sometimes the reason relates to a lack of staff but we need to call out some schools that refuse to engage in the programme for whatever reason. They just do not seem to want to get involved. We do not want a situation in which schools are forced into this. That would never be a good situation for anybody. However, there needs to be strict criteria. There need to be strict grounds as to why a school does not provide this programme, because it is beneficial.  Again on the staffing element, the recommendations from the committee need to be taken on board. I would like to know whether it will be possible for key elements of this to be in place for this summer because that is crucial. Parents are already battling on many fronts. This is just one small element. They are trying to get a school place, transport to the school, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The same set of parents are fighting all of these individual battles over and over again. It is important for us to secure some of these for this summer and to give that reassurance to parents.

I thank the chair of the committee, Senator Carrigy, and I thank Deputy Buckley for moving the motion. The committee took the decision to issue an interim report because it was important that enough lead-in time be given for the recommendations laid out in the report to be implemented ahead of this summer. I echo what Senator Carrigy said about the Business Committee expediting the matter and allowing for a longer debate than is normal on a Thursday evening because many Deputies were looking to make a contribution on it.I would like to pull back and take more of a wide-lens view of what has happened with July provision, which is now summer provision. The fact of the matter is that the programme has expanded and changed over time. It was initially devised to mitigate regression for children with special educational needs, SEN, and also served as a form of respite for parents of these children. That was entirely appropriate as the first staging point. Different elements have been added to it in the interim such as an opportunity for DEIS schools to provide summer camps, the HSE-led range of summer camps catering for up to 1,200 children with complex needs and, just last year, that provision for Ukrainian kids. All of those are welcome and it is no harm at all that we have a programme that has now become multi-stranded and multifaceted. However, there is a need to refocus and reconsider what it is that we really want to get out of the summer programme for all of those strands and also to make sure we are not missing out, particularly on that most vulnerable cohort for whom the original programme was designed. There has been an expansion in the numbers from 15,000 in 2019 to 80,000 in 2021. There has been a massive expansion in the programme. We can expect that there will be a need to refocus. The power of this report may be to force us to draw breath, to look again at the programme and make sure we are achieving the original goals and, as we have added strands, to determine whether we are catering as we should to the people who have been brought into the net. Senator Carrigy said one thing that I disagree with. He said that the parents who have been in to this committee have fought tirelessly. They are tired, really, are they not, when we think about it? The parents who have had to come in and give their testimony to this committee have really had to delve into their personal life experiences and have had to fight again and again with a system to access resources and services for their children. They have not fought tirelessly. They have fought relentlessly, for sure, but they are tired. I can well understand it. The original purpose of this programme had that respite element in it. It is important. I am an educationalist by training and background and I am going to talk a little bit about how we should be focusing on the curriculum of what we want to achieve in the summer programme. That respite element is so important and should not be underestimated. I am going to read a quote from Miriam Jennings, who came and spoke before the committee:The pressure on the child, parents, siblings and extended family is immense. [That reference to siblings and extended family is something we often forget.] There are no summer camps, playdates or family holidays during the nine or 13 weeks away from school. The long break causes an increase in the number of episodes of sensory overload, a regression in skills and a greater incidence of anxiety, self-injurious behaviours, aggression towards parents and siblings, destructive outbursts and absconding. When a child is regressing and losing the ability to cope, this puts a strain on families trying to support him or her. Family relationships come under immense pressure.We cannot understate that. It is not a bottomless well that these people draw their courage and energy from. It is difficult to be a parent of a child who might have additional needs. It is difficult to be a sibling of a child who has those additional needs. We have heard that at the committee. It is often one of the great unspokens. The brothers and sisters within those families often find it difficult to say that. It is important for everybody within the family group that this is in place. We may have lost a little bit of focus on what summer provision should do because of the expansion of the programme. That is an important part. We should be looking towards what it is we want to achieve within the summer programme. We want to avoid regression, keep people in routines they are used to, and provide that valuable respite for parents and families. What else? It is surely not the exact same curriculum that is being delivered week in, week out, or is it? In my opinion it should not be. It is summertime for everybody involved. Are we giving any sort of clear guidance and instruction to those schools that are trying to provide a summer programme and summer provision about what they should be covering during that period? If we think about those multiple strands that we have in place, maybe we need to be giving a clear delineation between the strands. We should also think about access to therapeutics. It is an opportunity, even in the context of the school buildings. For example, I visited Bunscoil Gleann Sidheáin in Cappoquin. In the normal run of events it has two classrooms that cater for the autistic children who attend there. During the summertime there is actually much more freedom in terms of the built environment, access to the green spaces, the hall and so on. They are not in competition with the other classes in the school. Is there an opportunity during that period to get access to therapeutics in a more meaningful way? Others in the House have talked about the range of skills we could bring in, maybe people who are training for this, want to have the experience and are bringing a different range of skills into the mix. Given the massive and welcome expansion in the programme over the past number of years, maybe it is an opportunity to draw breath and look again at the objectives we want to achieve here. I would not be happy with myself if I did not draw attention to one aspect here that we do not discuss enough. That is teachers' energy, teachers' burnout and principals. When we are asking schools to run summer provision, we are asking teachers who have had a long year going from September to the end of June. I have done it myself many years and they fall across the line on 30 June and need to recharge their own batteries as they have had a tough year. It is the same with principals. I do not know how teaching principals keep going when they do two jobs for one-and-a bit times the pay. They only begin their second job when all the children have gone home. We have to provide support into the schools as well. It is so important that we start the planning process now. That is one of the reasons I really welcome the interim report. We also have to resolve the pay issue. The Minister of State mentioned the online portal and that did substantially improve things last year, but there is a little bit of a hangover. There were teachers and special needs assistants who engaged previously in summer provision and did not see a paycheck arrive until maybe December and were put off as a result. We have a little bit of work to do in terms of remediating that to invite those people back in and assure them that those teething issues have been dealt with. All in all, it is a very coherent report. It is short and to the point. I hope it is going to give the Minister of State something to consider in providing for summer provision this year. I thank the other members of the committee and in particular the committee chairperson for bringing the report forward.

Senator Carrigy is welcome to the House. It is fitting that he is here on such an important subject. I have gone through the report. There is some really good stuff in it and I commend the work of the committee. I thank all the parents from Mayo who contacted me to say how important it was that I be here this evening and that the report be implemented. There are massive expectations around what it is going to mean for them and their children and, rightly said, for siblings of autistic children as well. That is what we are all here for. While I am here, I want to mention the great work of Mayo Autism Camp, not least because I am missing a really important event they had today in launching their autism resource fair, which is taking place on 1 March in the McWilliam Park Hotel. They do really good work, both Colette and Elisha from Mayo Autism Camp. The Minister of State might have met them last week when she was in Mayo.I welcome that she was in Mayo and I know she met many of the parents and children to whom this report and the full implementation of it will mean an awful lot. I know too the Minister of State met Robbie, the 13-year-old boy who has been without education for many months. These cases help to remind us of the human beings who are behind this, be they the young people, the children or the parents, and it reminds us of why we need to make it work. I noted that the report looked at the Maltese model and what they do in summer provision there. In Malta, eight weeks is provided and the report detailed how the programme is provided. Elaine Jenkins of the special needs school classes highlighted this programme, which is an interesting one, but we are a wealthy country so there should be no reason whatsoever we could not provide for our children what is provided for children in Malta. The most notable thing about that example is that it is equitable. Every child gets the summer programme for eight weeks and that is what we should be aiming for here, for all the reasons that are outlined in this report and that others spoke about. I commend and recommend to the Ministers of State the work of Amanda McGuinness. Many of those here will have heard of her. She was diagnosed as autistic when she was 39, she has three autistic children and she does wonderful work. There is a good YouTube video where she explains her story and she is good at helping us all to understand better the needs of autistic people and autistic young people. I commend her work. She is a fantastic woman and she has done a lot to help us to understand better. We are speaking about summer provision and the number of parents who are forced each year to take up private therapeutic interventions and access private care services. Above any other year, this year people are loaded down with bills and the cost-of-living crisis we are going through. It makes it even more urgent that the recommendations in this report are implemented because we cannot have a situation where parents are forced to take unpaid leave from work and where siblings might be forced to take unpaid leave from work as well to fill in the gaps. We need to be mindful of that. We all hear from parents of the one commonality, which happened during Covid as well, namely, how their young people regressed. They regressed in maths and reading, if they did those subjects, and they regressed in their social skills. That regression is not only deeply unfair to the person involved and to the parents but also to us in building up the capacity of children and young people and helping them to fulfil their potential. If they continue to regress, it will take longer for them to fulfil their potential. We need to be mindful of that and to ensure it does not happen. I noted that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, said everybody should get a place. I would love to hear it said that everybody must get a place. I know the Minister of State is doing everything she can to get that done. It is very important that schools are given the resources. It is also important somebody is accountable and somebody states what has to happen, asks what is needed to make it happen, and offers to provide the resources to make it happen. It is not good enough to ask parents whether they have the option of home tuition because that is not suitable for everybody and sometimes I feel it is a get-out clause. That should not be used when we know the benefits of social interaction for children and young people. They are unquantifiable in many ways. I will go back to where I started in terms of the expectations of parents. I hope the recommendations the committee worked so hard to have documented in this report are implemented in order that they will make a difference to the lives of the people we are all here to support.

I was not scheduled to contribute but I was listening to the debate and I decided to do so. I thank Senator Carrigy for the work he and the Committee and Autism have done on this interim report. I thank Deputy Buckley for sponsoring the motion and giving me this opportunity. There is a lot of good work and there are a lot of positive suggestions within the report. This is a case of the Government, across Departments, wanting and willing to work together. It does not all fall within the responsibility of the Department of Education. There is a role within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in supporting the home support part of it. I also commend all the parents and the representative organisations that came before the committee and shared with it. While it is a child-centred approach, Deputy Ó Cathasaigh is correct in saying there are families there, including other brothers and sisters, throughout that long period of summer. I have a vision that we can all work together and that we can achieve the goal the committee's report has set out. There is a role here for the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE. In the meantime, I will be trying to put regional respite in place. I was sharing with the Minister of State the idea of children who, during the summer provision, will have the opportunity to attend a regional respite house, whether it be equine-based or sport-based. We will have therapists in those houses to assist and complement the summer provision the report has laid out for us. I thank the Minister of State.

I commend Senator Carrigy on his work and Deputy Buckley on sponsoring the motion. I thank both of them for their contributions and I thank Deputies Canney, Connolly, Michael Moynihan, Tully, Joan Collins, Ó Murchú, Funchion, Ó Cathasaigh and Conway-Walsh. I have taken a note of everything they have said, as has an official from the Department, along with taking note of the report. We will be looking at all of it in detail. I will respond briefly to some of the issues that have been brought up. We want the recommendations put in place for this summer. That is what we are endeavouring to do. I have addressed all of the recommendations in some form or manner. We are introducing a specific special school programme this year as a pilot initiative so that we can have a real focus on supporting these schools in a new way. We are also introducing the new summer programme co-ordinator role, which will operate at a national level to support special schools in finding solutions. That national co-ordinator will work with schools to facilitate arrangements that are needed. On the school day itself, for special schools in particular we got feedback from both parents and schools that the school day would be reduced from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The staff, however, will be paid for the full day. This recognises the challenges that are associated with running the programme in a special school, including break times and transport concerns. That feedback will encourage schools to do more weeks and to participate. The available workforce will also be critical to the success of the programme and a portal will be available for teachers and SNAs to register their interest in working on a school-based programme in a special school. That workforce portal will be advertised in our universities and it will be promoted through education partners. In another first, where a child's special school is not running a school-based programme, another portal will be available that will allow parents to register their children’s details so that, if a place becomes available in another location, their participation in a programme may be organised. Across the summer programme more broadly, many developments have been undertaken, including extensive consultations. We have introduced a theme for the first time this year, which will have an emphasis on creativity, fun and learning activities, and that will be inviting for students and staff alike. On preparation hours, a dedicated school organiser role will be in each school that is offering the summer programme. That should also assist. There will be enhanced levels of information sharing and training, which should help with the transitioning arrangements. There will also be one programme this year for mainstream primary schools to replace the previous special classes and inclusion programmes in order that there will be one cohesive programme instead of separate ones. Garda vetting was mentioned a couple of times. As Deputies know, the summer programme was announced much earlier this year and the new organiser role in schools can address the vetting issue. The school will be able to apply for Garda vetting earlier to ensure that it is completed before the programmes run in schools. It is to be hoped that will also help. I will also have ongoing engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, regarding the CDNTs, which were also brought up. On EPVs, it is important to say that schools have flexibility, when designing the summer programme, to hold it at a time that best suits parents and staff. That is one of the main reasons it is not called the July programme. A few people mentioned the July provision as opposed to the summer programme. It is called the summer programme in order that there is flexibility for schools to hold it in July, August or, in some cases, June. It need not necessarily be just July. The Department is providing funding to schools to allow them to appoint a staff member to co-ordinate and design the summer programme from an earlier stage to maximise participation. It is intended that such co-ordination will mean schools can avoid times when staff may wish to access CPD courses. In addition to existing staff in schools who can work on the summer programme, the Department is also facilitating arrangements for other staff to be available this year. These staff include early childcare workers and students in a variety of related disciplines, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and social care. The CPD courses are of two weeks duration. The new requirement will be for eight hours of synchronous provision per online course. Some 40% of the total hours can be spread across a number of different modules. The remaining 60% of the hours can be done when the teacher wishes. The Department is aware that the revisions mean changes in how the online CPD courses are run, both for course providers and the teachers attending them. The Department is engaging with providers to listen to the concerns they have raised. A Deputy asked me about how many special schools may be participating. The scheme is not launching until next week so no school has registered yet. The registration portal will open very soon and the national co-ordinator will be reaching out to all special schools. If there are issues, we will look at local arrangements between schools. I again thank the committee for the comprehensive body of work that has been put into this report by all committee members and Deputies. I appreciate the fact it was stated that this is a cross-party issue and, to a certain extent, a non-political issue. Even though we are all politicians, we all have the best interests of children and people with autism at heart. The summer programme is not just about children with autism; it is also for disadvantaged children and migrant communities, including Ukrainians, who were mentioned and were largely able to be assisted last year, which was of great benefit to them in their integration into Irish communities. I again thank all Members. I will take the interim report's recommendations very seriously. We will revert to Deputies in due course.

I thank everybody across the House. I enjoyed listening to their contributions and I welcome the comments of the Ministers of State. I will put on the record, and the committee is very proud of this - Senator Carrigy was the driving force behind it - that Leinster House is now in the process of becoming autism friendly. I thank everybody in the Houses, including staff, management and so on, for that. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, takes on the report's recommendations. I love what the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said about this matter being cross-departmental. That is the way it should be. The Committee on Autism is cross-party. It is a proud day for everybody that this is a step forward and is progressive. I will give Senator Carrigy the rest of the time and the spotlight in the show.

I thank the Deputies for their contribution to this important debate. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for the commitment she has given on behalf of the Government that changes will be made. I also welcome the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. The fact that both Ministers of State are in the House debating the issue, in addition to giving a commitment to implement the strong recommendations in our report, sends out a very strong signal to parents. That is very significant for parents. I am conscious that many Deputies, including me, are very passionate about autism services for many personal reasons. Many of them will have autistic people in their families and will be acutely aware of the difficulties they face in trying to access the services they require. Many, if not all, have been contacted by a great number of families regarding difficulties in accessing services for children and adults, whether these are school places, therapies or summer provision. I greatly appreciate that this debate has taken place. I am especially grateful to the parents and families who have campaigned tirelessly to have their voices and those of their children heard in the House. I am also grateful to Deputies for listening. It is essential for us as legislators, especially the Government, to now act on the contributions made by parents and to adopt the report's recommendations. I repeat that I welcome the commitment that has been given by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on behalf of the Government. While this report was published in response to the frustrations experienced by autistic children and their parents in trying to access the programme, it is also important to address the issues raised in the report and to look to the future with positivity following the comments and the commitment given by both Ministers of State. These recommendations, when acted upon, will benefit autistic children and their families in the present but will also amount to an invaluable investment in their futures. This is about the future of these children. These recommendations, when adopted, will also provide our future teachers, therapists and psychologists with the privilege of working with children with special educational needs and witnessing their development first-hand. It is also important to note and acknowledge, as Deputy Ó Cathasaigh said, the work of the principals, teachers and SNAs in all the schools, including special schools, mainstream schools and special classes. We are extremely grateful for the work that they do. I will put on record that it should not be repeated that only 40 out of more than 130 special schools provided a summer programme in 2022. I ask the principals to start planning now, with the support that will be announced, as the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, said, over the next number of days. New plans are being put in place. We should start planning for summer 2023 to increase that number and get to a situation where it is the norm that every single special school has a school-based programme. That is what we need to work towards. I will pick up on a point made by Deputy Ó Murchú regarding RPM. Those of us on the committee, when young Fiacre Ryan, his mother Carmel and his family attended a meeting, know that Fiacre gave one of the most powerful opening statements that will ever be read into the record of the Houses. It is an issue for the committee that it wants to see an RPM trial started in a school. I know of a school in my area where parents are fund-raising. I am attending a fund-raising event on Saturday week to help them to bring in a clinician to teach staff in the school to allow children who are non-verbal to have their voices heard.I will read a couple of lines from young Fiachre's opening statement. He said:I’m afraid of people who feel that people with autism are less than others. I am speaking for all who are hidden in a world of outside shadows, waiting to be heard, waiting to be accepted.In his book, he writes: "Try to see past the autism and realise we are the same as others". We have a method that we can use to help non-verbal children, and it needs to be supported in schools throughout the country. I am grateful for the work put into the report by my fellow committee members. I thank them for their dedication to the committee. I look forward to our continued co-operation as we work towards publishing our final report. As has been said by a number of Members, there is cross-party support in respect of this matter. We work very well together to make sure we are working in the interests of the children and their families. I am grateful to the witnesses who contributed to our deliberations, including the many teachers and special needs assistants who work to provide a successful programme for autistic children and children with special educational needs. It has been a particular privilege for me to work with the autistic community and their families on the report and on the work of the committee in general. Their support, insights and contributions informed the report and will also inform our final report. On my behalf and that of the committee, I thank all those who contributed to producing the report and to this debate. I commend the report to the House.
