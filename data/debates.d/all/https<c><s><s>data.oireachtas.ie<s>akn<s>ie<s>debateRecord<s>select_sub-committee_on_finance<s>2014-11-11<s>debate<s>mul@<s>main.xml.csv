The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014, which was referred to the select sub-committee by Dáil Éireann on 9 October.  We have this meeting room until 3 p.m.  Therefore, I propose that we proceed as far as possible and, if necessary, resume consideration of the Bill at 5.30 p.m. in committee room 2.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

The cross-reference to the definition of "holding company" will, in all likelihood, be out of date by the time this Bill is enacted.  A "holding company" is defined in section 8(1) of the Companies Bill 2012 which states company A will be the holding company of company B where company B is the subsidiary of company A.  This derives from section 155(4) of the Companies Act 1963.  We expect the Companies Bill to be enacted this year; therefore, it seems prudent for us to update the Irish collective asset-management vehicle, ICAV, legislation to reflect this.  Amendment No. 5 includes a cross-reference to the definition of a holding company and is tabled for the same reason.

Amendment No. 6 amends section 14 to set out some of the particulars that are to be recorded in the register of ICAVs including, where relevant, any changes in the instrument of incorporation, the location of the registered office, and the names of the directors and secretary.

A concern I expressed, which is my primary concern, is that this seems to be a mechanism to encourage activity in this area without appropriate regulation and that there is a lesser regulatory burden on these ICAVs than there might otherwise be.  Given that it is lack of regulation in the area of financial speculation that landed us in the mess we are in, I would like to know the meaning of authorising things that are outside the UCITS regulations.  I am not familiar with them but I presume those regulations are the more normal regulatory regime.  Why are we authorising things and insulating them from the normal regulatory regime?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	13	I thank the Deputy for his question.  I have to be clear.  We are not authorising things that are not already authorised in terms of UCITS, AIFs or the likes.  We are putting a new vehicle in place for them to operate.  Currently, there simply is not a well-fit vehicle for them to operate in.  We already have a situation where there are similar such mechanisms as we are trying to put in place here in France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and a range of other European countries.  We are trying to create an investment vehicle for funds in this country.  What we are doing, and I touched on it in section 8, relating to this specific section is that the ICAV will require authorisation from the Central Bank to carry on the business of an ICAV.  It also limits the business to that permitted to be carried on under this Act and, where applicable, the alternative investment funds regulation or the UCITS regulations which govern activities on investment funds.  In essence, every ICAV will need an authorisation to carry on business either as an alternative investment fund or as a UCITS under the UCITS regulation.    I will defend to the death against the idea that we are in any way dumbing down or reducing regulation.  What we are trying to do is treat these as they should be treated and rather than involving the Companies Registration Office in something that is not a normal company, the Central Bank will take over the role.  However, the actual level of scrutiny under the Central Bank remains, and the Deputy will see throughout the course of this Committee Stage that I am introducing a number of amendments that will further enhance regulation regarding accounting standards and so on that we will get to later.  On the section about which the Deputy has asked me specifically, every ICAV will need an authorisation either as an AIF or as a UCITS before it can conduct any investment activity.  The UCITS regulations which are in place since 2011 already make provisions for such authorisations and a proposed amendment to the UCITS regulations contained in section 132 will enable an ICAV to apply to apply to be authorised as a UCITS.  However, in respect of an AIF, it is necessary to provide for the authorisation of an ICAV as an AIF, and section 17 simply states that chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Bill provides for that authorisation procedure.  In this section we are simply outlining the process that needs to be followed to be authorised as an ICAV.

I need to look into the UCITS regulations because one is flying blind in a situation like this one where one does not know how one compares with the other in terms of the level of regulatory burden and obligation.  I am concerned, particularly when I look at some of the promotional material from KPMG, Ireland's first tailor-made corporate funds vehicle.  Essentially, it was selling and promoting these ICAVs as mechanisms whereby one can avoid tax and have a lesser regulatory burden.  I know that is not directly relevant to this discussion but my concern is that we are creating two different sets of rules.  The perception KPMG seems to be putting across is that the rules here are less burdensome and that is much more favourable from the investors point of view.  I want to express my concern about that.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	21	It is more favourable from the investor's point of view but it does not impact negatively on the Irish taxpayer because it allows the investor, and I am sure this will arise later, to avail of the check-the-box rule in the United States which allows the investor to be taxed on an ongoing basis instead of deferring a tax and being taxed at a higher rate in the US afterwards.  The big benefit for the investor is being able to avail of a US tax mechanism called check the box, which is a very transparent mechanism.  It is in place in the US system and is something the US system could change at any time.  In fairness to Deputy McGrath, he summed up the position very well on Second Stage when he said that this legislation is an attempt to catch up and keep up with our competitors, and that is what we are doing here.  I genuinely do not believe that it in any way reduces regulation.  It merely moves the administration of the vehicle from the Companies Registration Office to the Central Bank.  The Deputy is right.  A number of organisations have promotional material but I am quite proud of that fact because I want to try to attract more corporate funds to this country and to do so we need a vehicle.  I know we differ on that politically but that is the rationale behind the legislation. Sections 18 to 30, inclusive, agreed to.

Interpretation

Definitions
87. (1) In this Part—“charge”, in relation to an ICAV, means a mortgage or a charge, in an agreement (written or oral), that is created over an interest in any property of the ICAV (and in section 88(8) and sections 93 to 98 includes a judgment mortgage) but does not include a mortgage or a charge, in an agreement (written or oral), that is created over an interest in—(a) cash,(b) money credited to an account of a financial institution, or any other deposits,(c) shares, bonds or debt instruments,(d) units in collective investment undertakings or money market instruments, or(e) claims and rights (such as dividends or interest) in respect of any thing referred to in any of the foregoing paragraphs;“property”, in relation to an ICAV, includes any assets or undertaking of the ICAV.(2) Any exclusion provided in subsection (1) to what is defined in that subsection as constituting a “charge” may be varied by order made by the Minister if the Minister considers that it is necessary or expedient to do so in consequence of any Community act adopted after the commencement of this section relating to financial collateral arrangements.(3) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a mortgage or charge created over both—(a) an interest in anything specified in any of paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (1),and(b) any property, assets or undertaking not falling within any of those paragraphs,the mortgage or charge shall, other than to the extent to which it is created over an interest in anything specified in any of the foregoing paragraphs of subsection (1), be regarded as a charge within the meaning of this Part.”.This is a new Part which mirrors provisions on charges and debentures for companies as set out in Part 7 of the Companies Bill 2012.  The first amendment deals with charges and the second with debentures, Chapter 2.  Both Parts reflect the established law on charges and debentures for investment companies.  The Central Bank will maintain a register of charges in a manner similar to that of the Companies Registration Office in the 2012 Bill.  The priority of charges will be determined in a similar manner to that provided for in company law.  The register of charges will be available free of charge for inspection on a website maintained by the Central Bank.  Amendment No. 9 provides for the interpretation of certain terms in the new Part.  The expression “charge”, which includes a mortgage under current law, is expressly stated not to include a mortgage or charge over an interest in cash, money credited to an account of a financial institution, or any other deposits, shares, bonds or debt instruments.  This is in accordance with the exception of the registration requirement envisaged under the Collateral Directive, 2002/47/EC, on financial collateral arrangements.  Chapter 2 deals with the registration and priority of charges.  Two separate procedures for the registration of charges are envisaged.  The first, the one-stage procedure, is similar to the procedure under the current law, namely, that particulars of all charges created must be delivered to the Central Bank within 21 days of their creation.  The second, the two-stage procedure, provides that an initial notice can be sent to the Central Bank stating the intention of the ICAV to create a charge, followed up by a further more detailed notification in 21 days of the creation of the charge stating that fact.  Where the priority of charges is not governed by some other regimes, such priority will be determined by reference to the date of receipt by the Central Bank of the particulars of that charge.  Amendment No. 10, dealing with section 88, provides for the registration of charges created by ICAVs.  The section drawn is from section 409 of the Companies Bill 2012 and originally from section 99 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended by section 122 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  It provides that all charges created by an ICAV must be registered in accordance with this section.  Subsections (3) and (4) detail the one-stage and two-stage procedures.  Amendment No. 11, dealing with section 89, derives from section 410 of the Companies Bill 2012 and provides for the duty of the ICAV to register charges under section 88 and the right of other parties to effect registration.  Amendment No. 12, dealing with section 90, reflects section 411 of the Companies Bill 2012 and deals with situations where an ICAV purchase property which is subject to a charge.  Since this section only requires charges created by an ICAV to be registered, this section is necessary to ensure charges that were created by an individual but for which the liability for repayment is assumed by the ICAV are registered by that ICAV.This ensures that the records of charges on an ICAV property will be more complete. Failure to comply with these requirements will be an offence. Amendment No. 13 provides for a new section 91 which sets out the priority of charges. This section is modelled on section 413 of the Companies Bill 2012. Subsection (1) provides that priority be given to the creditor who files first in time in order to minimise the potential for fraudulent abuse and thereby protect creditors. This priority will be subject to any overriding priority applicable to certain assets under already established law. Subsection (2) clarifies that where several charges are registered on the same date, the charge that is registered earliest in time and on that date shall have priority. Subsection (3) clarifies the meaning of the date of receipt of the specified particulars in the context of two different procedures for registering charges. Subsection (4) provides that priority as to charges will also be subject to any contrary agreement between the creditors such as inter-lender or priority agreement, often entered into by financial institutions where more than one such institution lends to a particular ICAV. Subsection (5) provides that the Central Bank does not have to enter details of a negative pledge in the register of charges. Subsection (6) defines a negative pledge clause as an agreement not to borrow money from a third party or otherwise create another charge. Amendment No. 14 provides for a new section 92 and concerns the registration and priority of judgment mortgages. Subsection (1) provides that a judgment converted into a judgment mortgage shall be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the ICAV unless the procedure for registration of a judgment mortgage in subsection (2) is followed. Amendment No. 15 provides for a new section 93 which sets out detail on the register itself and is modelled on section 414 of the Companies Bill. The register will include details of the date of creation of a charge or the acquisition of a property and the date of receipt by the bank of the information and any other matters specified by the bank. The bank will determine the form of the register and make it available on a website for inspection by the public. Amendment No. 16, setting out a new section 94, provides that a certificate of registration shall be given in respect of any charge registered under this Part. This provision is drawn from section 416 of the Companies Bill. Amendment No. 17 sets out a new section 95 dealing with the entries of satisfaction and release of property from charge. It is modelled on section 417 of the 2012 Bill and requires a statement. Amendment No. 18, providing for a new section 96, is based on section 418 of the Companies Bill and provides for an extension of time for registration of charges and rectification of the register. The section permits an application by the ICAV or an interested person to be made in court for late registration where there has been a failure to file the specified particulars of a charge within the 21 days where the omission was accidental or does not prejudice the interests of creditors or shareholders. Amendment No. 19 proposes a new section 97 providing that copies of all instruments creating charges must be kept by the ICAV at the same place as the register of members. The section provides that it is an offence not to comply with this requirement. This mirrors the provision in section 418 of the Companies Bill. Amendment No. 20, setting out a new section 98, provides that charges must still be registered notwithstanding the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, which facilitates the use of swap instruments and provides that a mortgage or charge to secure a liability under a financial contract is legally enforceable against the charger. As I outlined on Second Stage, the rationale for these provisions is the desirability of transposing the relevant provisions of the Companies Bill to the ICAV legislation. That is what I am attempting to do here by mirroring the most up-to-date Companies Bill, which we expect to be enacted by the end of the year.

I have not had time to go back to that legislation and these amendments were only made available a couple of days ago.  Are these provisions simply lifted from the 2012 Bill or are we seeing a reduction in the requirements as set out in the Companies Bill?

References to "company" are changed to "ICAV", while provisions relating to transitional arrangements in sections 419 and 420 of the 2012 Bill are omitted in this legislation because the ICAV does not currently exist and does not, therefore, require such arrangements.  These amendments represent an effort to mirror the provisions of the Companies Bill, with some tweaks.  There are no policy changes being enacted in this legislation in comparison with what is in the 2012 Bill.  I hereby give notice of the likelihood that I will have to bring forward a number of amendments on Report Stage in view of the amendment made by the Seanad to the Companies Bill on Committee Stage.  The objective, as I said, is to ensure these provisions reflect the most up-to-date Companies Bill.  There is a fleshing out here of some of the areas in respect of which Deputy Doherty expressed concerns, such as accounting standards and the like.  This is not an effort to get away from the relevant parts of the Companies Bill.  On the contrary, it makes sense to ensure they are mirrored in this legislation.

(1) Every charge created by an ICAV shall be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the ICAV unless either the procedure set out in—(a) subsection (3) (the "one-stage procedure"), or(b) subsection (4) (the "two-stage procedure"),with respect to the charge’s registration is complied with.(2) If, in purported compliance with the requirements of this Part as to the taking of steps in that behalf, there is received by the Bank particulars of a charge that omit the required particulars in respect of one or more properties to which the charge relates, subsection (1) shall be read as operating to render void (as against the liquidator and any creditor of the ICAV) the charge as it relates to the particular property or properties in respect of which that omission occurs but not otherwise.(3) The procedure for registration under this subsection referred to in subsection (1) as the one-stage procedure consists of the taking of steps so that there is received by the Bank, not later than 21 days after the date of the charge’s creation, particulars, in such form as may be specified by the Bank, of the charge.(4) The procedure for registration under this subsection referred to in subsection (1) as the two-stage procedure consists of the following, namely the taking of steps—(a) so that there is received by the Bank a notice stating the ICAV’s intention to create the charge (being a notice in such form and containing such particulars as may be specified by the Bank, of the charge), and(b) so that, not later than 21 days after the date of the Bank’s receipt of the notice under paragraph (a) (the “first-mentioned notice”), there is received by the Bank a notice, in such form as may be specified by the Bank, stating that the charge referred to in the first-mentioned notice has been created.(5) If the requirement under paragraph (b) of subsection (4) is not complied with, within the period specified in that paragraph, the notice received under paragraph (a) of that subsection in relation to the charge shall be removed by the Bank from the register.(6) Subsection (1) is without prejudice to any contract or obligation for repayment of the money secured by the charge concerned and when a charge becomes void under that subsection, the money secured by it shall immediately become payable.(7) Where a charge comprises property outside the State, such particulars, in such form as may be specified by the Bank, (and, as the case may be, the notice under subsection (4)(b)) may be sent for registration under this section, notwithstanding that further proceedings may be necessary to make the charge valid or effectual according to the law of the country in which the property is situate.(8) If there is a change among the one or more persons entitled to a charge registered under this Part, the fact of that change having occurred, and particulars of the person or persons now entitled to the charge, may be delivered, in such form as may be specified by the Bank, to the Bank and registered by it.(9) Nothing in this section or any other provision of this Part authorises the delivery to the Bank of a deed, or any supplemental document to it, and this Part does not impose or confer any duty or power on the Bank to examine any deed or any supplemental document to it.".

Provisions as to debentures

Liability of trustees for debenture holders
99. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the following provision shall be void, namely, any provision contained—(a) in a trust deed for securing an issue of debentures, or(b) in any contract with the holders of debentures secured by a trust deed,in so far as it would have the effect of exempting a trustee of it from, or indemnifying him or her against, liability for breach of trust where he or she fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of him or her as trustee, having regard to the provisions of the trust deed conferring on him or her any powers, authorities or discretions.(2) Subsection (1) shall not invalidate—(a) any release otherwise validly given in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by a trustee before the giving of the release, or(b) any provision enabling such a release to be given—(i) on the agreement to the provision of a majority of not less than three-fourths in value of the debenture holders present and voting in person or, where proxies are permitted, by proxy at a meeting summoned for the purpose, and(ii) either with respect to specific acts or omissions or on the trustee dying or ceasing to act.".Amendments Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, provide for a new Chapter 3 dealing with debentures.  Again, these provisions substantially mirror those in the Companies Bill 2012.  Amendment No. 21 introduces a new section 99 which concerns the liability of trustees for debenture holders.  This section is drawn from section 423 of the Companies Bill.  Many deeds under which trustees for debenture holders are appointed contain clauses which absolve the trustees from liability in circumstances other than wilful neglect or default.  It is considered desirable that some checks should be placed upon the power of trustees to escape liability for failure to carry out functions for which they receive payment.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a new section 100 setting out provisions relating to perpetual debentures.  This amendment derives from section 424 of the Companies Bill.  That provision was first introduced to overcome certain doubts about the legality of perpetual debentures.  A provision making a debenture irredeemable or postponing it to some distant date would amount to a clog on the equity of redemption, thereby rendering the instrument void.  Amendment No. 23, providing for a new section 101, mirrors section 425 of the 2012 Bill and gives the ICAV the power to reissue redeemed debentures.  Under subsection (2), the person entitled to the debentures shall have the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed.  Subsection (3) deals with situations where debentures are deposited to secure advances on current accounts or otherwise.  Amendment No. 24 sets out a new section 102 which reflects the policy established in section 427 of the Companies Bill 2012 and, before that, section 97 of the Companies Act 1963.  It provides explicitly that a specific performance may be a remedy for breach of a contract to take up and pay for any debentures.  Amendment No. 25 provides for a new Chapter 4 dealing with prohibition on registration of certain matters affecting shareholders or debenture holders.  The new section 103 provides that the bank has no jurisdiction to accept or register an order of any authority affecting a shareholder or debenture holder of the ICAV or any notice of the making thereof.  Again, this group of amendments mirrors the Companies Bill 2012, which is desirable in regard to the ICAV.

It exempts the trustee and indemnifies him or her against liability for breach of trust.  I wish to tease out the second part of this, which states "where he or she fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of him or her as trustee".  This goes to the core of what is white-collar crime.  We are talking about funds domiciled in Ireland worth approximately €1 trillion, and people are investing that money in good faith.  When that money is managed in a way that does not show a degree of care and diligence, it is extremely difficult to prosecute somebody under this legislation or have them held liable.  It is extremely difficult to prove the degree of care and diligence required so has the Minister of State considered beefing up this section in the Bill to ensure there is further protection for those who have put trust in these trustees?

The new companies Bill has not even been enacted but we have mirrored the same provisions from that legislation.  I also take the broader policy point on white-collar crime and there is a series of offences in that regard throughout this Bill.  I have referred to some of them already but, in this section, we have just mirrored what is in the Companies Bill 2012.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	51	I understand that, and the Bill to which the Minister of State refers has not yet been implemented.  We will have to deal with the section on its own merit.  This is about exempting and indemnifying a trustee against liability, which could be quite large.  What benchmark would have to be reached under this section to show that the trustee has failed in the degree of care and diligence required?  It is okay to pass legislation with those words, which sound fine, but what are the benchmarks with the execution of this legislation?  It may not be possible to be more specific as there could be a danger of allowing others who fulfil some but not all criteria to be indemnified.  It is a catch-all reference and past experience has shown that it has been difficult, considering what has gone on in the banks, to identify legal breaches.  It is clear that in many cases there has been no legal breach, although public opinion might suggest otherwise.

There are approximately 70 various proceedings that can be instigated by either the Central Bank or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The issue is one of enforcement and there is significant regulation.  There is the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, regulation, for example.  I am not pretending to bring additional measures but there is a list of various enforcement measures that can be taken by the bank in the instigation of proceedings for offences, as well as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  There are many references to them throughout the Bill.  I am open to hearing more from the Deputy about this on Report Stage but I am not necessarily sure how it can be further beefed up in this legislation.  The issue is more about enforcement and for that we have the Central Bank, a regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We are not in any way letting any fund get away with less oversight than they now would if they operated under the Companies Bill, which will soon be enacted.

There is reference to "degree of care" and "diligence required" but there is no definition for either of those terms, apart from the fact that there must be "regard".  The word "regard" could be debated by barristers in the Four Courts for a couple of sessions with respect to "trust deed conferring on him or her any powers, authorities or discretions".  It seems from reading the section that the degree of care and diligence is defined by the trust deed conferring on him or her the powers but the section also refers to "having regard".  Could the definition of degree of care or diligence required strengthen this legislation?  It is a minor element that goes through financial legislation all the time but in the past it may have appeared as if there has been a lack of due care or diligence in certain areas but the legislation may not be clear-cut.  Other countries have more robust legislation but we do not seem to be as strong.  The question seems to concern the definition of terms inserted, including "degree of care and diligence required" or "having regard to".  I do not have any suggestions but it occurred to me when reading the section that it could need further scrutiny.

As the Deputy recalls me saying on Second Stage, I am eager with this Bill to show that where the Companies Bill provisions are appropriate for the Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV, we are mirroring them in full.  The ICAV has certain additional levels of safe checks in that there must be a depository to keep assets safe.  With our regulatory structures in general, as I have seen in my new role with the Irish Financial Services Centre, etc., the regulations are - correctly - more robust than they have been.  I am quite satisfied there has been a substantial body of work done there and at a European level.  If the Deputy has thoughts on the issue, I would welcome them on Report Stage.  I see what he is trying to do but I am trying to keep this legislation consistent with the Companies Bill.

That is welcome.  However, with human nature being what it is, regulators will identify problem areas and try to prevent them but they cannot stop them.  They can help to prevent them.  We are exempting a trustee from liability in law but we are using terms such as "degree of care" and "diligence required", which are not defined in legislation.  It is a big issue as a regulator may try to prevent this happening; there are provisions whereby a party is not exempted if he or she is in breach of the degree of care or diligence required.  There is no clear way to show how this could be the case so there will be cases where people could be in breach of their degree of care and diligence required and be able to avail of this section because we have not properly defined those terms.

I am informed that those terms, particularly "duty of care", are defined in European law, particularly the UCITS directive and the accounting information system.  I do not have the information to hand but it shows how these elements do not operate in isolation or a silo and although they will be overseen by the Central Bank rather that the Companies Registration Office, they are also subject to EU regulation.  I am cognisant of the point, which is broader than this legislation.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	62	I move amendment No. 26:In page 58, to delete lines 30 to 37, and in page 59, to delete line 1 and substitute the following:“(c) the other information provided for in the Schedule.(3) The annual accounts shall give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the ICAV at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the ICAV for the financial year.(4) The annual accounts may be prepared in accordance with—(a) generally accepted accounting practice in the State,(b) international financial reporting standards, or(c) subject to subsection (5), an alternative body of accounting standards.(5) To the extent that the use of any alternative body of accounting standards does not contravene any provision of this Part, a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of an ICAV may be given by the use by the ICAV of those standards in the preparation of its annual accounts.(6) In this section “alternative body of accounting standards” means standards that”.Changes in EU law mean that all ICAVs will eventually be subject to a requirement that the auditor must confirm that the accounts present a true and fair view.  This is a more exacting and explicit requirement and provides more detailed rules than were provided for in the Bill as published.  The manner in which the requirement can be imposed on ICAVs has been the subject of some consideration.  Section 94 permits the preparation of annual accounts to Irish accounting standards, international financial reporting standards and US and Japanese standards and envisages the standards of other jurisdictions being available also.  The effect of the amendment to section 94 will be to continue to allow for a range of accounting standards but only in so far as they are consistent with the true and fair standard.  The Central Bank will also be able to impose its own requirements on the accounting standards of ICAVs; therefore, while information can be presented for the benefit of investors in an accounting standard that they are, perhaps, more used to in terms of business, this will be allowed only in so far as these standards are consistent with a true and fair view and, if the Central Bank so chooses, with additional requirements which it can also impose.  I hope the proposed change will be welcomed as sending a signal that there will be no diminution of the overall regulatory standards for the ICAV.  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised the issue of accounting standards on Second Stage and I hope he welcomes the measure.  Amendments Nos. 68 to 70, inclusive, simply correct typographical errors in the Schedule, setting out the form the accounts of an ICAV should take.  In the first instance, what should read as “total assets” reads as “totals assets” and in the second, what should read “total liabilities” reads “total assets”.  The possibility of working to a range of accounting standards will be attractive to fund managers as it will allow them to present their annual accounts in a manner which may be best understood by their particular investor base and overseas investors.  In determining precisely in other jurisdictions what accounting standards are acceptable, the Minister for Finance may make regulations prescribing them.  An amendment is included to require the Minister to consult the Central Bank and other relevant stakeholders before making such regulations and this is a common-sense precaution.  There is an amendment to section 98 on the report of the auditor of accounts to require that the auditor give his or her opinion on whether the accounts meet the true and fair standard and have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework.    This group of amendments also provides for an offence of a director of an ICAV failing to comply with his or her duty to comply with the section and corrects an oversight in section 94 of the Bill, as initiated, in that regard.  This is setting out to restrict the ability of anybody to circumvent the true and fair requirement.  If we insert it in the legislation, we can be proud of it because we will be ahead of the curve.  Although it has not yet been transposed or introduced, it is prudent and appropriate that we introduce it in our ICAV.

This improvement is welcome and I can see the logic of allowing for other accounting standards as long as they meet the criteria.  It all seems reasonable enough.  However, "true" and "fair" are vague terms.  I assume there is more detail as to what they mean.  Is there necessarily a relationship between including the words "true" and "fair" and the true and fair standard, which would be set down in a more detailed way?  How do we marry them?  Should the true and fair standard not be set down in a particular place or developed by a particular body?  Is the European Union doing it?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	64	It will become a requirement under EU law.  It is included in the 1963 Companies Act.  When we published the ICAV, we did not include the true and fair test because, up to this point, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, and alternative investment funds, AIFs, about which we are talking in relation to ICAVs have had not had to meet it.  While it has been applicable in the 1963 Companies Act for companies, we did not apply it to the ICAV because, up to this point, UCITS and AIFs have not had to apply it in this country.  The true and fair concept is defined as a general rule of conduct or principle - the belief that businesses and organisations shall, truthfully, fairly or accurately present information on their financial conditions and operating results.  "True and fair" means that the financial statements are free from material misstatements and faithfully represent the financial performance and position of the entity. "True" suggests the financial statements are factually correct, have been prepared according to the applicable reporting framework and do not contain any material misstatement that may mislead users.  Misstatement may result from material errors or omissions of transactions and balances in the financial statements.  "Fair" implies that the financial statements present the information faithfully without any element of bias and reflect the economic substance of transactions, rather than just their legal form.  It is not sufficient for directors or auditors to reach such conclusions solely because the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  Auditors must consider whether the directors have fulfilled their responsibility in the preparation of true and fair financial statements when providing an audit opinion.  As Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett acknowledged, given that we are involved in global competition, it is desirable to allow the information to be presented in accordance with accounting standards that might be more familiar to investors.  We do not want this to happen at the risk of the true and fair test.  This is included in the 1963 Companies Act and coming down the tracks in European law and amendments to accounting and audit directives.  Although there is no legal obligation on us to impose it in the ICAV Bill, taking into consideration the commentary of members on other Stages of the legislation, it is prudent and appropriate to include it.

Am I correct in saying that section 4 refers to generally accepted accounting practice in the State plus international financial reporting standards - that between subsection (4)(a) and subsection (4)(b), the word "and" rather than "or" is implied?  The requirement is to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b), or (a) and (c); is that correct?

Let us forget about subsection (4)(c) to make it simpler.  Are we saying there must be compliance with paragraph (a) or (b)?  My reading is that the accounts should be required to be compliant with (a) and (b), so I am seeking clarification that it is (a) or (b), as the Minister of State is saying.

That is the change.

There is a difference between accounting practices and financial standards, as dealt with in paragraph (a) versus paragraphs (b) and (c).  My understanding is that we would be dealing with accountancy practices, as referred to in paragraph (a), plus one of the standards referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c).

It is a matter of standard drafting practice, as opposed to a policy decision.  We are achieving the same thing.  Perhaps the Deputy can clarify what he would like me to do.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	84	I suggest that we are not achieving the same thing.  If companies are allowed to prepare their annual accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the State, that does not require compliance with international financial reporting standards or an alternative body of accounting standards, as listed in the legislation.  This allows companies to report accounts that are in compliance with neither the accounting standards listed in legislation nor the international standards, but only the accounting practices in the State, which are inferior to the standards that are in place internationally, whether in Canada, the United States, Japan or any other region.

Companies can present accounts according to standard accounting practices under the rules in this country, in accordance with various international standards as outlined in the legislation, or according to an alternative body of accounting standards as listed in the legislation.  I do not accept the point that the standards under subsection (4)(a) are inferior to the standards under subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c).

A practice may change from time to time, whereas a standard is adopted by a governing body.  International standards are governed by the IFRS, and there are the American standards, the UK standards and so on.  A practice is very different from a standard.  Practices evolve as time goes on.

I am not conceding that I am convinced, however.  The intention is not that the provision in subsection (4)(a) should be any less than the standards in subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c).
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicles Bill 2014: Committee Stage	88	I assumed it was intended to set out some accounting practices and the use of those practices to align with standards.  The Minister of State referred earlier to the fact that the standards are talking to an international audience.  The legislation allows companies to compile annual reports based on a number of standards.  We have now suggested that they can do so according to accounting practices here, to international standards, to Canadian standards, to Japanese standards, to American standards or, possibly, to a number of other standards.  Why do we not require them to present accounts to the Irish standards, which are the international standard anyway?  We use the European standard.  Why do we not ask companies to comply with one standard?  Five different funds might be quite similar to each other but might present their accounts in five different formats.

We need to provide flexibility to present the information in accordance with the format and practices in the country where most of the investment is made.  What I am trying to do through the entire section which was not included in the Bill as published, based on concerns I heard people like the Deputy express, is to have an extra layer in place to ensure these standards meet the true and fair test.  It is not something the country is obligated to do as yet under EU law; therefore, we are being proactive.  If the Deputy wishes to table amendments on Report Stage, I will certainly look at them.

It is an issue I have raised.  Because we are giving legislative approval for the first time to these types of fund I am not convinced that we should allow flexibility to present the annual accounts for Irish domiciled funds in five ways, at a minimum; there may be others listed in secondary legislation.  It is an issue in financial institutions, some of which have used UK or EU accounting practices and there have been conflicts and differences.  There is an ongoing debate within the British jurisdiction on accounting standards and the issue is being investigated or the subject of hearings at Westminster.  When establishing something new and because this will be the first time we will have this new model, why do we not use the term "international accounting standards"?  We should try to be as tidy as possible.  Perhaps it is an issue on which the Minister of State might be willing to come back on Report Stage.

As discussed on Second Stage, we are introducing this system to catch up with our competitors.  If we were to introduce a system that did not offer the same flexibility as our competitors, one wonders what would be the purpose in introducing it.  The legislation also provides that the Central Bank can impose whatever set of standards and regulations it wants above and beyond it.  Between the true and fair test, the Central Bank having the ability to add additional layers, requirements and standards and the issues we have raised in the amendments, we are looking at the issue in a comprehensive manner.  It is, however, the Deputy's prerogative to table amendments on Report Stage.  If he does, I will be willing to consider them and engage with him on them.

However, when we are looking at our regulatory body to oversee this issue, we should make it as simple as possible.  I am open to being convinced in asking to have these funds apply international standards.  The debate globally is moving towards the use of international standards.  There is resistance to this from established practices in the United States and some of the larger countries.  I would be interested in hearing from those who operate this type of plc system whether complying with international standards is onerous.  I cannot see how it is.  It will, however, make the job of interpreting much simpler with the fair amendment tabled by the Government.   We may come back to the issue on Report Stage.

Making it flexible for them, even with the amendment, will allow funds to pick and choose the standards that benefit them.  We should not do this.  There is a risk in that regard to investors.  There may not be a risk to the State as such, but there is a risk to financial institutions located in the State that invest in these funds.  It has happened in the past.  I have been involved in a long debate with the European Union, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance on accounting standards which allow the banks not to disclose losses.  It was completely legal, however, because they had chosen to use a certain standard over another.  I wanted to raise a red flag for the Minister of State and it is welcome that we are going further than the European Union.  Unless there is a substantial reason such as it would scare off these funds, we should apply a uniform set of standards.

I strongly believe that after these amendments are included, we will produce a vehicle that will meet the highest standards internationally in the presentation of true and fair accounts.  I appreciate that the Deputy has welcomed this, but I will certainly look at the issue before Report Stage and, perhaps, the Deputy might do the same.

A feature of company law is that public auditors may also be qualified to audit company accounts.  In crafting section 101 similar language was used, but on reflection I believe it is more appropriate that it only be statutory auditors or firms within the meaning of Part 4 of the audit regulations.  In any case, ICAVs can only operate as UCITS and IAFs which already have to meet this requirement; therefore, the removal of the reference to public auditor in this case is purely a technical exercise to tidy up the text.  The amendment to section 103 is consequential to the amendment to section 101.  It is the straightforward and prudent thing to do and was overlooked in the original location.

I want to be sure the Bill robustly allows auditors to flag potential concerns they may have.  While I stand over the Bill in terms of its provisions on annual general meetings, I wish to ensure that if an auditor wishes to flag an issue to members, he or she will not be required to resign to allow motions to be moved before he or she can do so.  This issue will arise at various stages of our discussion and I will refer to it when we debate a number of other amendments.  I wish to address the issue on Report Stage to ensure the voice of the auditor is heard.  Subsection (4) provides: "On the date on which the holding of an annual general meeting is dispensed with in accordance with section 84(4), any auditor or auditors appointed in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) cease to hold office and the directors shall immediately reappoint the auditor or auditors or appoint a new auditor or auditors".  The provisions on auditors are very much in line with company law as this probably reflects the best practice available to us.  I acknowledge Deputy Pearse Doherty's point which he also made on Second Stage that, under the Bill, it is not necessary to hold an annual general meeting.  We must ensure mechanisms are available to auditors who wish to raise concerns.  I will examine this issue before Report Stage.

These are large funds and cannot be compared to a local credit union.  This should not, however, weaken the position of the auditor or his or her ability to flag issues, as the Minister of State pointed out.  While I welcome the provision allowing shareholders to call an extraordinary AGM, the provision that AGMs are not necessary sticks in one's craw because annual general meetings are forums in which information is imparted and so forth.  While I am aware that we are chasing Luxembourg on this issue and I have flagged the need to introduce legislation to change the position that obtains in another jurisdiction, how is the issue of annual general meetings addressed in other jurisdictions?  I welcome the Minister of State's statement that he may table an amendment on the issue on Report Stage because this is a key aspect of the Bill.

I do not have the information the Deputy seeks to hand, but I will examine the matter before Report Stage.  The Deputy has correctly noted that no one turns up for the annual general meetings of these types of vehicle because they are not companies in the sense companies are understood in the Companies Acts.  I do not want to have legislation in place that in any way weakens the voice of the auditor.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  I have an open mind on whether the Bill does this and there are some areas I wish to tease out.  Given that an extraordinary general meeting cannot be called if the persons seeking such a meeting collectively hold less than 10% of the voting rights in the ICAV, one must ask if an auditor will have an opportunity to address investors.  I will consider this matter before Report Stage and would welcome the Deputy's submissions, views or amendments on it.

Where subsection (5) provides that the directors may appoint an auditor in the event that subsection (4) is not fulfilled, subsection (6) provides that the Central Bank may appoint the auditors in the event that subsection (4) is not fulfilled.

Subsection (6) reads: "Where, in any case, no auditors are appointed as required by subsection (4), the Bank may appoint a person to fill the vacancy".

Subsection (4) provides that the directors shall immediately reappoint the auditor or auditors or appoint a new auditor or auditors.  Subsection (6) has been linked with subsection (4) for this reason, although one could validly argue that it could be linked with subsection (5).  My reading of subsection (6) is that if the directors of an ICAV do not immediately reappoint auditors or appoint new auditors, it will fall to the bank to appoint a person or person to fill the vacancy.

Subsection (4) only deals with cases where an AGM is dispensed with and provides that in such circumstances "any auditor or auditors appointed in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) cease to hold office and the directors shall immediately reappoint the auditor or auditors or appoint a new auditor or auditors".  This is fine, but it applies to cases where an AGM takes place, whereas subsection (5) applies to circumstances where an AGM does not take place, in which case the directors are empowered to appoint an auditor or auditors.

Subsection (5) permits a partnership properly constituted under the law of the State or the law of another state to act as an auditor of the ICAV.  It is not necessary to separately list Irish law and the laws of other jurisdictions.  The proposed change results in a simpler and clearer text.

Amendment No. 33 clarifies that UCITS, which are companies that are not investment companies under Part 14 of the Companies Act 1963, soon to be Part 4 of the Companies Act 2014, that is, UCITS plcs are also eligible to convert to the ICAV form by way of continuation.  It should be noted that there was no intention to exclude such companies when formulating this provision and the amendment corrects that oversight.  While we envisaged this easy conversion process for AIF and UCIT company funds, funds which are not constituted as companies will have to undergo a different process to become ICAVs.  Other small changes in these amendments include devolving to the Central Bank the power to determine day-to-day policy considerations such as the form of application for a conversion and the manner in which the certificate of incorporation provided to the Central Bank should be certified.  The Central Bank is better placed than the Minister for Finance to determine these matters and in this instance it is not appropriate to follow the precedent set out in company law.  It is a different arrangement in terms of the Companies Registration Office.  The amendment to subsection (3)(f) is straightforward in that it merely clarifies that when setting out charges for security interests related to the conversion company, the company should also identify the priority of charges.  This is something we addressed earlier in our debate on the Bill.  This amendment is simple in form and effect but it rectifies an error in the original text.

MIGRATION

CHAPTER 1

Migration-in to become ICAV

Definitions
123.	(1) In this Chapter - “migrating body” means a body corporate which is established and registered under the laws of a relevant jurisdiction and which is a collective investment undertaking; "registration documents” has the meaning given by section 124. “relevant jurisdiction”, in relation to a migrating body, means the place, outside the State, prescribed under subsection (2) where the migrating body is established and registered at the time of its application under section 125.(2) The Minister may make regulations prescribing places, outside the State, for the purposes of the definition of “relevant jurisdiction” in subsection (1) where he or she is satisfied that the law of the place concerned makes provision for migrating bodies to continue under the laws of the State or for Irish collective asset-management vehicles to continue under the laws of that place in a substantially similar manner to continuations under section 125.Sections 127 and 128 of the Bill as published cross apply the provisions of the Companies Acts to ICAVs concerning the moving of corporate entities in other jurisdictions to Ireland to establish as ICAVs, and the necessary corollary of ICAVs deregistering in Ireland to establish as corporate structures in other jurisdictions.  The Minister for Finance has decided to set out these provisions via Committee Stage amendments.  These sections will be replaced by a new Part which mirrors the provisions on migrations for investment companies as set out in Part 24, Chapter 9 of the Companies Bill 2012, taking into account the specific nature of ICAVs.  The Part will facilitate the inward migration of investment funds from designated jurisdictions and provides for their continuation in Ireland as ICAVs.  It will also facilitate the outward migration of ICAVs to designated jurisdictions and provides for their continuation there.  Section 123 is the definition section and defines the terms "migrating body" and "relevant jurisdiction" for the purpose of this chapter.  Due to its expansive nature, the definition of registration documents will be contained in a stand-alone section.  These definitions are similar to those in section 1403 of the Companies Bill 2012.  It is also provided that the Minister may by regulation prescribe places outside the State as a relevant jurisdiction in certain circumstances.  Section 124 gives a definition for registration documents, which is currently found in section 1403 of the Companies Bill 2011, and derives from section 256(f)(i) of the Companies Act 1990.  This section sets out the technical documentary requirements with which a migrating body must comply before it can be registered as an ICAV and authorised by the Central Bank.  Section 125 sets out the principal elements of the migration process, and copies section 1405 of the 2012 Bill, derived from replicate sections 256(f)(i)-(x) of the Companies Act 1990.  This section permits collective investment fund corporates registered in prescribed jurisdictions to apply to migrate their registered offices to Ireland without having to wind up their existing jurisdiction first.  Migrating bodies may apply to the bank to be registered as an ICAV in the State by way of continuation.  Section 126 contains further practical requirements in respect of the registration of migrating companies in the State.The key point is that the authorisation to carry on business as an AIF or a UCIT is automatic upon acceptance of an application to migrate. It also provides that if an applicant fails to comply with the requirements of section 125, the bank will give it 30 days to remedy this failure and its failure to do so may result in the bank starting proceedings to strike it off from the register of ICAVs. Section 127 provides house definitions for the purpose of the provisions on deregistration of investment companies incorporated in the State that may wish to migrate to other relevant jurisdictions. Again, this section mirrors section 1402 of the Companies Bill 2012. Section 128 contains the detailed provisions relating to the deregistration of ICAVs who wish to continue as bodies corporate in prescribed jurisdictions. These provisions reflect section 1403 of the 2012 Bill. Before granting deregistration, the bank must be satisfied that all requirements of this Bill in regard to deregistration have been complied with by the ICAV and that all fees and levies due to the bank have been paid. The application to deregister must be accompanied by a statutory declaration stating that these requirements have been met and notice of the application must be published in Iris Oifigiúil. Creditors of the ICAV or holders of not less than 5% of its issued share capital may apply for an order preventing the proposed migration and deregistration of the ICAV. Section 129 contains further provisions in regard to the deregistration of an investment company under this chapter and they replicate section 1404 of the 2012 Bill. Section 130 is based on section 1405 of the 2012 Bill. It states that where an application is made by a migrating ICAV to be registered in the State, or by a company seeking to migrate out of the State, a director of the ICAV must make a statutory declaration that the entity is solvent. Subsection (2) sets out the requirements in regard to the making of the declaration, which must include a statement as to the assets and liabilities of the ICAV. In addition, the declaration must be accompanied by a report of an independent person giving an opinion as to the reasonableness of the opinion of the director and the statement of the assets and liabilities. Again, it will be an offence for the director to make a declaration under this section if he or she does not have reasonable grounds for believing that the ICAV can pay its debts as they fall due. As with other provisions in this legislation and other amendments we are bringing forward today, the decision has been taken that it makes sense to expressly state the provisions that appear in various Companies Acts and the Companies Bill, rather than just cross-referencing.

We are dealing with quite technical matters, and we can all acknowledge this is quite technical and an area we do not interact with in our daily lives.  We are on page 75 of the legislation that was passed on Second Stage and there are five pages left, yet we have 22 pages of amendments.  These amendments are not like the amendments we dealt with earlier, which sought to delete words or technical details, but, instead, are supplanting entire sections and chapters of the legislation.  I have no problem with that and I understand where the Minister of State is coming from in regard to the Companies Bill, as it stands.  The problem I have concerns a request I have made before and which I hope will find more favourable ears this time.  It makes it very difficult for Opposition and perhaps some Government Deputies when we get amendments reasonably late in the day which do not only amend the legislation but basically add another 50% to it in areas that were not looked at in the original legislation, would not have been dealt with on the heads of the Bill or on Second Stage, and which were not flagged.  The point I am making is simple.  I understand that the officials might be under pressure.  However, when the legislation is published, we get an explanatory memorandum with notes for each section, up to a certain point.  To have further explanatory notes at this stage would make it a lot easier for us in considering how the legislation interacts with company law and all the rest, given we are dealing not just with this but with the deadline for finance committee amendments at 11 a.m. tomorrow.  While we can deal with the shorter amendments that change a word or a line, when we are changing the entire Bill or adding to it, even if that is to make it more robust, I suggest that, if possible, we would have a note to help explain this.  It is about ensuring the company law provisions are dealt with properly.  Speaking for myself, it would make my life a lot easier and we might be able to get through this more quickly.

We provided a briefing on ICAV before Second Stage, which was useful, but we did not do it before Committee Stage.  I take the point and I know time was tight.  I am more than happy to make my speaking notes available to the Deputy now, in advance of Report Stage, which should help him if he wants to apply a further level of scrutiny.  Going forward, I have no difficulty with that, nor do my officials, and it is something we can certainly do, particularly on technical Bills like this.  The Deputy can take it as a given that I am supportive of what he has said.  In this particular case, however, I would argue we are not substantially trying to change the Bill.  It might sound like that when we are reading out pages and pages, but rather than just relying on a cross-reference with the Companies Acts, the legal advice has been that it is better to actually spell it out in the legislation.  The actual thrust of what we are trying to do has changed very little, I would contend, but I take the point.

The problem for ourselves, when we get this number of amendments coming in late in the day, is that the first thing we ask ourselves is where the Department is coming up with this and why it is coming in like this.  It is not clear.  When we are informed, it is then our job to figure it out and the penny finally drops that this is just about ensuring it is more robust and making sure that what is in the companies legislation is transposed into this Bill.  However, a little note of the type I have suggested would have saved myself and our office a lot of time, and would have helped us give better scrutiny of the Bill.

Strike Off and Restoration

Chapter 1

Strike off of ICAV

When Bank may strike ICAV off register
125.	(1)	Except in the case of an application by an ICAV to be struck off the register of ICAVs, the Bank may strike an ICAV off the register of ICAVs if?—	(a)	the ICAV is not an authorised ICAV,	(b)	there exists one or more of the grounds for striking off set out in section 126, and	(c)	the Bank has followed the procedure set out in sections 127, 128, 130 and 133(1).	(2)	In the case of an application by an ICAV to be struck off the register of ICAVs, the Bank may strike the ICAV off the register of ICAVs if?—	(a)	the ICAV is not an authorised ICAV,	(b)	the conditions for striking off set out in section 131 have been satisfied, and	(c)	the Bank has followed the procedure set out in sections 132 and 133(2).”.Section 125 of the ICAV Bill, as published, cross-supplied the provisions of the Companies Act to ICAVs.  However, on advice, the Minister for Finance has decided to set out the provisions in extenso via Committee Stage amendments.  Section 125 will be replaced by a new part which mirrors the provisions on strike-off and restoration for companies as set out in Part 12, Chapters 1 and 2, of the Companies Bill 2012.  This new part sets out the circumstances in which an ICAV may be struck from the register and the second group of amendments, which we will get to shortly, deals with the procedures for restoration.  It contains provisions concerning both voluntary and involuntary strike-off of an ICAV.  In the case of involuntary strike-off, an ICAV may take a remedial step in order to avert the strike-off process.  The concept of voluntary strike-off is being placed on a statutory footing with certain conditions being established before the process can commence. Amendment No. 49 permits either the Central Bank or the ICAV to be struck off the register of ICAVS where it is not an authorised ICAV and the conditions governing voluntary and involuntary strike-offs as set out in subsequent provisions have been fulfilled. This new section is similar to a new provision being introduced by section 726 of the Companies Bill 2012 in respect of the striking-off of companies. Subsection 1 provides that the Central Bank may strike an unauthorised ICAV from the register of ICAVs where one of the grounds for strike-off listed in section 126 exists and the Central Bank has followed the procedure set out in sections 127, 128, 130 and 133(1). Subsection 2 provides that an unauthorised ICAV may apply to be struck off the register of ICAVs where the condition for a voluntary strike-off, pursuant to section 131, has been fulfilled and the Central Bank has followed the requisite procedures set out in sections 132 and 133(2). Amendment No. 50 provides the grounds upon which an ICAV may be involuntarily struck off the register of ICAVs by the Central Bank as follows: the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe the ICAV does not comply with section 13 of this Bill which deals with the provisions of registration information by the ICAV; an ICAV not authorised by the UCITS regulation 2011 that has failed to apply for an authorisation pursuant to section 18 of this Bill within 12 months of registration; the ICAV is being wound up and the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe no liquidator is acting; and the ICAV is being wound up and the Central Bank has reasonable cause to believe the affairs of the ICAV are fully wound up and returns required to be made by the liquidator have not been made for six months.  Amendment No. 51 provides that the Central Bank may notify an ICAV of its intention to strike it from the register of ICAVs, in accordance with the proposed new section 128, on foot of grounds set out in the proposed section 126. This new section is identical to a new provision to be introduced by section 728 of the Companies Bill 2012 and it simplifies the general notice procedure for the strike-off of companies. Subsection 1 provides that the Central Bank may notify an ICAV of its intention to strike it from the register of ICAVs, in accordance with section 128, on foot of grounds set out in section 126. Amendment No. 52 sets out the required contents of the Central Bank's notice of its intention to strike an ICAV from the register. This new section is similar to section 729 of the Companies Bill 2012. Amendment No. 53 inserts and lists the remedial steps in respect of the grounds of the strike-off, as listed in section 126, that may be taken by an ICAV for the purpose of sections 128 to 130, inclusive. For example, having been granted authorisation is a remedial step. The new section 129 provides that, depending on the circumstances which led to the strike-off, a remedial step for an ICAV may be complying with section 13 of the Bill, obtaining an authorisation pursuant to section 18, providing details of a liquidator in up-to-date statements or providing notification pursuant to section 65 (6) of the Bill of the appointment of a director. Section 730 of the Companies Bill also provides for this new concept of a remedial step and, as with this section, affords an opportunity to the company to avert the continuation of the strike-off process by doing one of the things listed in the section.  Amendment No. 54 provides that the Central Bank may publish a public notice of its intention to strike the ICAV from the register of companies where no remedial steps have been taken by the ICAV since notification, pursuant to section 127. Amendment No. 55 provides for the conditions to be fulfilled by an ICAV seeking to be voluntarily struck off the register of ICAVs by the Central Bank. Amendment No. 56 obliges the Central Bank to give public notice of its intention to strike an ICAV off the register of ICAVs where it has received a valid application from the ICAV. Amendment No. 57 provides that where the necessary pre-conditions for voluntary and involuntary striking-off of an ICAV have been fulfilled, the Central Bank may strike the ICAV off the register of ICAVs and the ICAV will then be dissolved upon publication of the notice of the strike-off. Amendment No. 58 details the effect of removal from the register on the ICAV, together with its dissolution.  Amendment No. 59 empowers the Central Bank to seek a statement of affairs of the ICAV or such further information from the directors of an ICAV that has been involuntarily struck off. This is identical to a new provision to be introduced by section 736 of the Companies Bill and is in accordance with the recommendations of the company law review group, except for the enforcement powers given to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. In the original Bill it was intended to deal with the issue of cross-referencing. There are some differences between an ICAV and a company and, therefore, the Minister for Finance, on advice, took the view that was important to set out these processes.

I have a question on the involuntary strike-off of an ICAV and the robustness with which the Central Bank can act in this regard.  We know the three criteria which have to be met.  Section 126 sets out the grounds for dealing with an unauthorised ICAV, and refers to not having authorisation by the end of the 12 month period and so on.  It seems as though a process has to be followed which can take a considerable period of time.  Is the view that it is robust enough to protect people who invest money in funds which are managed by ICAVs and so on?  A public notice will be issued in cases of voluntary strike-off.  That is not the case in an involuntary strike-off because there is usually notice with which the ICAV can comply.  In some cases it is not a case of compliance, rather, it is a notice that it will be struck off.  What type of protection is in place for individuals?

I take the point that it is not always about compliance, but putting in the remedial steps in respect of the grounds of strike-off is an important safeguard for an ICAV which is trying to avert the strike-off.  There are conditions for a voluntary strike-off.  Deputy Doherty asked about an involuntary strike-off.

An ICAV may not be registered and may not have complied with section 13.  If an ICAV continues to operate during that period of notice, which is, I understand, 28 days, it could continue to draw investment into the funds it manages.  I know the Central Bank has proposals to try to get them back, but in the case of a liquidation they will be stung anyway.  They should not be, because the Central Bank has identified a problem.  Can a requirement be included in the Bill that ICAVs do not continue to draw on those type of investment funds where a notice has been issued?

Where an ICAV is, in effect, going into or is in liquidation, but there is a period of time during which the fear is that it will continue to take in more funds, the Central Bank has the power to immediately stop the bank seeking new funds or issuing new shares.  It is something I am happy to re-examine between now and Report Stage.  It is not the case that a period of 28 days has to be allowed to elapse before the Central Bank tells an ICAV it is not allowed to take in any more funds.

“Chapter 2

Restoration of ICAV to register

Application of Chapter
136. This Chapter applies to an ICAV that has been struck off the register of ICAVs under Chapter 1.”.This relates to Chapter 2 of this new section and as I have noted deals with restoration in regard to "strike off".  The provisions here match those set out for investment in other companies in the Companies Bill 2012.  Restoration of an ICAC to the register is possible on application to the Central Bank or the High Court within up to two years of the date of dissolution.  Amendment No. 60 provides that this Chapter applies to an ICAV that has been struck off under Chapter 1.  Amendment No. 61 adds a new section, section 137 detailing how an application may be made to the Central Bank to have the ICAV restored to the register.  This section is similar to section 728 of the Companies Bill 2012 in respect of striking off companies, which is derived from section 311A of the Companies Act 1963.  Amendment No. 62, section 138, details how an application may be made to the High Court to have a company restored to the register.  This section is similar to the new provision to be introduced by section 739 of the Companies Bill 2012, in respect of the striking off of a company.  Amendment No. 63, section 139, details the notice requirements for making an application to the court under section 138.  Amendment No. 64, section 140, details specific terms to be inserted in listed instances in a restoration order made by the High Court pursuant to section 138.  Amendment No. 66, section 142, outlines further orders that the High Court may make on foot of applications made under section 138 or section 141.  Section 142 lists the following supplementary orders that may be made by the High Court on foot of applications made under sections 138 or 141.  That is, to give directions on placing the ICAV and all other persons in a position as if the ICAV had not been struck off, to direct the ICAV to change its name, where there may now exist another ICAV of a similar name, to order that the officers of the ICAV be held liable of a debt or liability incurred by or on behalf of the ICAV while the ICAV was struck off and such further orders as it may deem appropriate.

Is that just being spelled out in greater detail and enclosing it in the legislation?  Is it the same issue and instead of cross referencing it is being included in the Bill.

However, in the context of the strike off, there are one or two obvious differences, where an ICAV differs from a company.  Therefore, we cannot strike off a company straight off.  We cannot strike off the ICAV without ending the authorisation, as we discussed earlier.  An ICAV does not have to file an annual statement.  In general, the policy intent is the same as it was on Second Stage.

“Fees
130. Fees shall be payable in accordance with section 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942 in respect of the performance by the Bank of its functions under this Act.”.This is a technical amendment to take account of the existing requirement in section 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, that the bank can only prescribe fees for functions it carries out, for example, registering an authorising ICAV, where the relevant legislation specifies by reference to section 32A that it may do so.  With the introduction of the new Parts to the Bill, by way of amendment here today, it is thought safest just to have a blanket referral to section 32E to cover all elements of the Bill.  This will mean that the bank will be able to ensure that industry bears a fair share of the cost of regulation.
