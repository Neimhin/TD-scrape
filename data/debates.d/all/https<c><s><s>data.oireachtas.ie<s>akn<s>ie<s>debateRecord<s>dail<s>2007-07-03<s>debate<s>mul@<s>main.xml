          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I met the leaderships of IBEC and ICTU on Wednesday last.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss implementation of the Towards 2016 agreement, against the background of ongoing concerns about inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">For our part, I outlined the Government's commitment to engaging fully with the social partners to secure full implementation of the agreement in order that its objective of building a strong economy and society is achieved on a sustainable basis.  In that context, we reviewed, among other issues, recent trends in inflation.  We discussed, in particular, the special impact of higher interest rates and fuel prices on the headline inflation rate.  While noting that the combination of pay increases under Towards 2016 and the changes in budget 2007 have ensured real increases for workers, the meeting acknowledged the extent to which inflationary pressures threatened the achievement of the objectives of the pay agreement.  We on the Government side reaffirmed our commitment to framing public policy in the period ahead with a view, to the greatest extent possible, to minimising inflationary impacts and keeping costs for enterprise under control.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">The Irish Congress of Trade Unions' representatives highlighted the particular problem of workers exposed to significantly higher housing expenditure as a result of higher mortgage interest rates.  It was agreed that the potential for addressing that issue would be considered further, especially having regard to the announcement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance about further increases in tax relief for mortgage interest.  It was also agreed that the Government and IBEC and ICTU would engage in intensified co-operation in responding to the inflationary pressures within the framework of the pay agreement and especially through the work of the anti-inflation group and the high level group on manufacturing.  We agreed that a further similar meeting would be arranged to review the progress made in addressing these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Regarding social partnership more generally, the inaugural plenary meeting with the social partners under Towards 2016 took place on 15 February in Dublin Castle.  The meeting received and discussed the first progress report on implementation of the agreement.  The report was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">Since the inaugural plenary meeting a number of meetings have been held with the social partners in relation to implementation of Towards 2016.  On 2 April my Department hosted a seminar for the social partners focusing on implementation of the life cycle framework under the agreement.  The steering group held its second meeting on 30 April.  The meeting focused on the people of working age life cycle stage and also received and discussed updates on Transport 21, the Government White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, and the national climate change strategy 2007-12.  We are currently meeting the social partners on a bilateral basis to discuss issues arising from the steering group meeting, in particular monitoring groups and mechanisms.  The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 12 July.  The steering group will receive the second progress report on implementation of the agreement.  The report will also be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, the relevant monitoring committees and groups continuing from Sustaining Progress, together with the new groups established under Towards 2016, are continuing to progress their particular areas of work under the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">Regarding the national implementation body, it continues to meet as required to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of Towards 2016.  It has met on a number of occasions in recent months to assist in the resolution of industrial disputes.  As the House will be aware, the body played a key role in resolving the nurses' dispute.  Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussions on some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Will talks on a new pay agreement be brought forward, as called for by the trade union movement due to the ever-spiralling inflation we are witnessing currently?  Has the Taoiseach noted the comments of the SIPTU president, Jack O'Connor, who has pointed out that many factors leading to inflation are well within the control of Government?  On house price inflation, for example, Mr. O'Connor pointed out that four decades after the Kenny report no Government has ever confronted the need to deal effectively with the price of building land or invest sufficiently in the provision of social and affordable housing to maintain house prices at some rational level.  What will the new Government do to address this most pressing of issues?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the entire debate on housing needs to focus on need, on affordability and on accessibility, and less on price and profit which have very much been the focus of so much commentary and attention over many years?  Does he accept this is a key issue in social partnership?  What new measures will the new coalition Government introduce?  When will the new pay talks begin?</p>
            <p eId="para_16">On a matter related to my last question, the social partners include the Government, employers and trade unions, but there is a fourth very powerful influence in Irish society, namely our friends from the fourth estate.  In terms of talks regarding social partnership, I am referring to media magnates and Independent News and Media and its supremo, Tony O'Reilly.  Can the Taoiseach tell us if any members of the Government attended the pre-election meeting with Mr. O'Reilly?  Who attended such a meeting, which the Tánaiste has acknowledged took place?  Did the Taoiseach attend such a meeting in the lead up to the general election, and what was its purpose?</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Nobody here could disagree that the newspapers in the Independent Group clearly swung in behind the Government in the latter days of the campaign.  Was that a by-product of any such engagement?  Would the Taoiseach like to tell us where that fitted in to the area of social partnership?</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_18">Deputy Ó Caoláin is stretching it.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_19">As he clearly is accountable here, I ask that he outline the purpose and the issues addressed and who attended.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_20">On inflation, I stated in my reply that the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I met the leaderships of IBEC and ICTU and discussed all of these issues.  As I stated, the purpose was to discuss Towards 2016, and particularly the aspects of mortgage interest rate increases — there were eight 0.25% increases over the past 18 months — and oil prices.  They represent over half of the rise in inflation over the same period.  These are factors mainly outside our domestic control but we have examined and discussed all the issues in our control.  Bilateral meetings with various agencies, including the Central Statistics Office, the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the Commission on Energy Regulation, were held with a view to establishing the scope of remedial action on inflation.  We discussed the position of the energy regulator and other local authority charges that are outside the determination of central Government.  We discussed the fact that inflation in consumer services is running at 9.1% per annum in the year to date, while consumer goods inflation is at 0.3%.  We spent considerable time examining the factors behind this because it is alarming.  While mortgage interest is a large component of service inflation, it seems clear that competition in the services sector is an issue as well.  Otherwise, we would not have figures such as this.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">The anti-inflation group was established to examine ways to reduce domestically generated inflation.  The group is composed of representatives of the Government, IBEC and ICTU and has considered detailed assessment provided by the CSO and contributions from the consumer price index.  We will continue to examine these areas and see what action we can fulfil.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">Regarding Deputy Ó Caoláin's second question, I agree that issues go up and down on the factors affecting housing and the price of housing.  The arguments change and the defences one puts in at one time are turned around in another period.  For years I have defended our actions to increase supply so that it meets demand.  This is the reason for the increases but as soon as one reaches that position it comes as a factor that we see a downturn in the market.  In fact, we are still building houses and the figure is a multiple of what the EU, or any component part, and the US is building.  I do not understand the argument but it is probably a lack of knowledge on the part of people who talk about these matters.  They do not consider the underlying figures but that is of no great interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">We have substantially increased the investment in social and affordable spending, now four times the figure from one decade ago.  We are building on the progress and the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, sets out an ambitious programme of delivery for the next three years.  We are increasing the number of expected starts and acquisitions of social housing for the period 2007-09 by 4,000 to 27,000 units, a mix of local authority housing, voluntary housing, co-operative housing and long-term contracts under the rental accommodation scheme.  Some 17,000 households will benefit from affordable housing measures in that period and 60,000 will benefit from social and affordable measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides resources of €18 billion for social and affordable housing.  We should and are putting efforts into this end of the market.  Our commitments go beyond simple social and affordable housing.  Some 140,000 households are planned and finance has been made available over the period, building on the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report on housing.  The Exchequer provision for this year is almost €1.5 billion, an increase of 10% on last year.  That is what we are doing now.  The new Government is supporting these major resources, allowing for the commencement of 6,500 local authority houses.  There will be some 2,000 starts in the voluntary and co-operative sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">Right.  I note the Taoiseach met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last week and had a lengthy discussion with it.  He is due also to address it tomorrow.  This is the last occasion on which he will be in the House until 26 September and if the ICTU wants him to attend its conference which continues until Friday he could certainly go on Thursday or Friday.  It is a slight to the House to have him bail out again on Wednesday morning but I cannot do anything about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">What is the Taoiseach's view of the reasons the Government has failed to keep down inflation?  The rate is now 5%, more than twice the European average and the highest in the euro zone.  This is a cause of considerable concern among a broad range of people working in the economy.  Government spending in the past seven years has been increasing way above the growth in nominal income.  This is causing inflationary pressures in its own way.  What pro-consumer measures has the Government introduced in the area of sheltered services that will protect the consumer from an inflation rate that is doggedly at 5% or above?</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Following a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and in consideration of what the Taoiseach will say to it tomorrow, unions have been warning that they will seek further pay increases if the inflation rate is not controlled and Government policies continue to fuel inflation directly.  What is the Taoiseach's answer to this?  Trade unions state they will be forced to seek pay increases because of the reduction in real incomes because of the inflation rate as a consequence of policies proposed by the Government.  What is the Government's response to this?  In view of the fact that it has been joined by two members of the Green Party as Ministers, will the Taoiseach change the social partnership agreement in order that it will include a third sustainability pillar with energy targets as a central issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_37">I am sure the Taoiseach will have seen the report from Credit Suisse which indicates a growth rate of 3% this year.  Does he have any belief in this or does he disregard it?  If he gives it credence, does he believe the Towards 2016 agreement can be implemented?</p>
            <p eId="para_38">Has the Taoiseach had discussions within the Cabinet about the consequences of the Government's failure to reduce the inflation rate which is causing serious concern?  Given that a representative of the Progressive Democrats is involved — I am aware the mother of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is deceased — with members of the Green Party, what is the approach the Government intends to take in the coming months to attempt to reduce the inflation rate?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_15">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_39">There are a number of questions and I will try to go through them all.  It is the Government's view that a wage inflationary spiral is in no one's interest.  It takes the view that wage increases to chase the inflation figure never work and never have.  This happened two or three times in the past decade.  It always has been better for us to devote all our efforts to trying to deal with the inflation issue and we managed to so do a number of times.  I refer, in particular, to dealing with those factors that we can bring under control to effect a reduction, rather than trying to change it with pay rounds.  I have made this argument strongly and will do so again tomorrow.  If one simply spirals pay increases after rising inflation, everyone loses out.  The low paid and vulnerable workers, in particular, will definitely lose out.  As all Members are aware, wage moderation is a powerful counter-inflationary tool, while excessive wage growth can be a strong driver of rising prices.  I made that case last week and the Government has provided facts and statistics to demonstrate this.  Above all, we must bed inflation more deeply and avoid pricing ourselves out of jobs and growth with an unworkable formula of wage increases.  The Deputy has stated correctly we should not go down this road and I have no intention of so doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">We must consider the areas in which there are problems.   As the Deputy is aware, practically every other country uses the HICP and omits interest increases from their inflation rate calculation.  More than half of our inflation rate — 56% — arises from energy price and interest rate increases.  While I do not suggest leaving them out, this must be taken into account when comparing our figures with European ones.  Were other countries to include interest rate increases, it would increase the HICP in such countries also.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">When one considers the comments issued by the European Central Bank, another one or two increases are likely.  Certainly the market is not discounting another 0.25% increase in the autumn.  While I am always trying to read between the lines of what is said by central bankers, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, seemed to indicate there would be another increase in the spring also.  Consequently, there is a figure of at least another 0.5% in this regard, which means that we must consider issues arising in the energy sector.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, energy prices in respect of electricity, natural gas, bottled gas, liquid fuels and solid fuels all registered zero or almost zero movements in price in the last few months.  In the case of natural gas, the average price has fallen by 10% since the spring.  I hope these are areas in which we can look forward to some reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">I refer to those areas in which we have a problem.  As I said, with the CSO's help and that of the all the aforementioned agencies, the Government is engaged in identifying how it can deal with such sectors.  It is clear there is a problem with services inflation, on which everyone is focusing.  It is running at 9.1%, as opposed to 0.3% in goods inflation.  Therein lies the problem about which it is most within our power to do something.  We have introduced all the aforementioned groups to try to focus on what can be done and find out precisely where are the problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">There are levels of competition.  The Deputy asked whether there were competition issues in this regard.  There are because while many such areas are very profitable and doing very well, they are fuelling inflation at a very high rate, which is running at more than 9% in the year to date.  Clearly, we must do more in this respect.  Already there have been meetings involving the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency, the Commission for Energy Regulation and similar agencies to try to focus our efforts on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">Have I covered all the Deputy's queries?</p>

            <p eId="para_46">As the Deputy has argued previously, it is very important to take into account consumer issues in such talks, as well as sustainability in respect of energy and other areas.  We will have to go back into talks on the second half of this round immediately after Christmas or before Christmas.  We must look at issues of sustainability and we are committed to addressing them and looking at some consumer issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">I had scheduled to attend the ICTU conference tomorrow because we were to hold the North-South Ministerial Body and the British-Irish Council meetings on Friday, but they have been put back to next week.  It was not ICTU's fault, I had agreed with the Northern Ireland authorities and the British Government to hold them, but Gordon Brown has asked me to switch those meetings to next week and I have agreed to do so.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_48">The greatest benefit of the past 15 years of economic expansion has been that we have greatly increased the number of people at work, but I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that a surprisingly large number of people are on modest incomes.  They are confronted with a situation where the entire value of the pay terms provided for in Towards 2016 is being eaten up by inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Will the Taoiseach address the two specific issues raised by congress?  The average mortgage has increased by €320 in less than two years, which is a significant burden on many people.  How does the Taoiseach intend to respond to the congress recommendation that the tax relief on mortgages be examined in that light?  What is his response to the second proposition from congress relating to the VAT rate of 21%?  I presume the Green Party Ministers will join congress in supporting that proposition which was a cornerstone of their party's policy platform in the general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">In the Taoiseach's press release issued after his meeting with IBEC and ICTU, he stated: "the Government and IBEC and ICTU would engage in the intensified co-operation in responding to the inflationary pressures within the framework of the Pay Agreement, and especially through the work of the Anti-Inflation Group".  I have heard what the Taoiseach said generally, but what will the intensified co-operation focus on?  The anti-inflation group has been in existence since the previous agreement, but will the Taoiseach tell the House two or three practical measures recommended by that group and what action has been taken on those recommendations?</p>
            <p eId="para_51">In respect of a little matter of unfinished business between the Taoiseach and me before the last general election, he will remember that he inadvertently told me that 90 labour inspectors were in place.  It was an error as he was reading his notes upside down and he never intended to say that.  We found out that there are 34 labour inspectors.  How has that matter been proceeding since then and when will the figure of 90 referred to before the general election be reached?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_56">One can look back on the intensive work done.  The anti-inflation group did some good work in 2003 in identifying, through the CSO data, indicators for the precise areas where there were inflationary pressures, and in using the agencies I mentioned earlier to tackle those issues.  It tackled them directly by examining the issue of profit-taking in the relevant sectors and also through the Competition Authority, in terms of going after some of the sectors and making regulatory changes to improve competition.  This proved quite effective in the given timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">One of the issues on which the Competition Authority particularly focused at that stage was insurance, which was identified as a huge problem in the reports of 1999 and 2003.  The authority likes to quote this as its greatest success because we are now paying premia at 1997 levels, which has been hugely beneficial for inflation, particularly for large employers which must pay public liability insurance, workers' liability insurance and general insurance.  There are concerns about numerous other professions and while the Competition Authority has not finished all its work, it has produced fairly detailed reports on most sectors.  I have not reviewed its progress in the last two or three months but it has done significant work on the pharmacy, medical and legal professions and in consultancy in terms of architects and engineers.  It is has looked into all those sectors in great detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">It has also done much work on the services sector, although that was in 2003.  Services inflation was identified last week by the CSO as an area of particular concern, with inflation growing at 9.1% in the year to May.  The authority intends to intensify its work in this area.  It is clear there are a number of elements in that, identified by the CSO, where companies have had large hikes in terms of price increases in every quarter for the past year, protecting themselves at a time when inflation — excluding interest rates and energy which the companies cannot include in their figures — was 2.5%, while inflation in their sector is 9.1%.  Therefore, they are taking profit of four times the rate of inflation.  Those sectors are being analysed.  It is not always easy to drive down prices there.  The anti-inflation group and the high level group on manufacturing believe this area should be of prime concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">What was Deputy Rabbitte's other question?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_24">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_60">I asked about mortgage interest relief and VAT.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_25">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_61">The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance had already agreed and stated what he intends to do on mortgage interest relief in the next budget.  The ICTU has put forward its case that this increase in assistance from the next budget, on top of what was done last year, will not fully mitigate the eight interest rate increases that have already been imposed and those likely in the next 12 months.  I am of the view there will be at least two further increases, reading between Jean-Claude Trichet's lines.  The Tánaiste said he could not make any changes at this stage but would look at the ICTU's submission in his preparatory rounds for the next budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">There was no debate on the VAT issue.  Deputy Rabbitte is aware of my view on this in that I have not been a supporter of VAT reductions.  VAT is a broad tax and a good means of ensuring everybody pays.  It is not my priority in trying to alleviate these issues to implement VAT reductions.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the plight of those individuals who suffer most from rising inflation.  There are ways of more directly targeting resources to assist such persons through tax credits or other means, rather than through a reduction in the VAT rate.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_26">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_63">I have a specific supplementary question.  The Taoiseach spoke about the Competition Authority.  He quite properly pointed to excessive profit taking in certain areas of the economy and, indeed, excessive profits from fee increases imposed by various professionals.  There is no doubt such practices have existed for the past dozen years but, other than the Taoiseach's assurance that the sectors have been analysed, what has actually been done to address the issue?  Reports have been published and exhortatory work done by the Competition Authority but am I correct in saying, for example, that the only two cases prosecuted in the High Court by the Competition Authority concerned pet food for prize Chihuahuas and the League of Credit Unions?  If the Taoiseach were to take on collusive activities, abuse of dominant position and cartels in this economy, would he start with pet food for prize dogs and if he were dealing with abuses in the financial services sector, would he start with the League of Credit Unions?</p>
            <p eId="para_64">I think I am correct in saying that the Supreme Court has since reversed the extraordinary decision taken in the High Court.  The proposition that there ought to be more than one League of Credit Unions is like saying there should be two GAAs or FAIs.  I never heard anything so ridiculous in my life.  Is it not time that the Competition Authority took on some of the real forces and vested interests which are contributing to the inflationary pressures that threaten this country's economic situation?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">Perhaps they have not had litigation taken against them.  I am not here to defend the Competition Authority, which acts in its own role.  It has completed major studies and has been involved in serious dialogue on restrictive practices, unfair competition and limited access to professions with all the major sectors.  It is going through what I accept is a very long process involving various stages but what it has done in the insurance sector and is endeavouring to do in the legal and pharmacy sectors is increase competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">On the Deputy's question as to whether more action is needed, yes it is and perhaps the authority can start bringing cases because it seems reluctant to commence legal action rather than use its powers of persuasion to conduct analyses of these industries and drive down prices through the strength of the case it makes.  That is the attitude it has adopted and it is not for me to criticise or defend it.  In the past few years, it has produced major studies on how these professions work, how they use their cost bases and the areas which can drive down prices by allowing for more access and competition.  It has proved it is possible to do that in the professions, particularly in respect of the insurance sector where we have seen dramatic changes.</p>

How does he view this stance and what in his opinion are the implications for the terms of Towards 2016?

            <p eId="para_68">An enormous number of cases under the provisions of Towards 2016 involve workers and management engaging in negotiations around changes in work practices, productivity and the ability to pay.  They all have to abide by the terms of the provisions in Towards 2016.  I do not get involved in those negotiations, either directly or indirectly.  As I noted in my earlier reply, some of these issues come before the implementation group for assistance.  Most of these cases are worked on and dealt with every week by employers and trade unions and it is a matter for them to work through.</p>

Surely that cannot be the case.  Towards 2016 laid down quite specific pay increases for the duration of its term.  How can the Taoiseach say that management has the opportunity to lay down new conditions and new hurdles for workers to cross?  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position.</p>

That happens in most of our State and private companies all of the time.  Each Friday a list is published of cases which are at various stages of negotiation.  There could be 50 or 60 companies on that list.  That is just part of the normal process.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about two matters which arise in the context of his discussions with the social partners.  During the last Dáil I asked him a question about the Competition Authority's action against that section of SIPTU which organised Actors' Equity.  The Competition Authority pursued unemployed actors on the basis that they were liable to self-assessment, given that they had various employers.  SIPTU had to sign an agreement on the steps of the High Court that it would not organise such workers.  I produced a Private Members' Bill on the issue and the Taoiseach said he would consider introducing legislation.  The issue was to have been put on the top of the agenda of the social partnership talks some time ago.  Does the Taoiseach intend to revisit the issue, given it has also arisen with regard to the Competition Authority's action against pharmacists?  The authority has argued that pharmacists cannot be collectively represented, even though they have a negotiating licence.  I argued that in both cases the Competition Authority was striking down trade union rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">As the new talks open tomorrow with the social partners, is it not a fact that the targets for social and affordable housing in every one of the agreements so far have not been met?

As the construction industry finds the heat going out of the market at ends that were perhaps more profitable to it, we have been emphasising that it would be more attractive and successful for the industry to move to social and affordable housing.

        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
           if he will report on the content of the newly revised treaty recently agreed by European Union leaders at the June 2007 European Council meeting; the position of the Government on the Charter of Fundamental Rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_55">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_97">The Government is pleased with the outline of the reform treaty that was agreed at last month's European Council meeting.  The reform treaty will amend the existing treaties in various ways so as to create a more efficient and effective Union that can better serve Europe's future needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">Our principal objective going into these negotiations was to retain the substance and balance of the draft constitutional treaty that was agreed during the Irish Presidency in June 2004.  This objective was largely achieved in that the great bulk of the 2004 agreement will be incorporated in the reform treaty when it is finalised later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">In the wake of the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, it was necessary to make certain changes to what had been agreed in 2004.  The changes decided on at the recent European Council included dropping the constitutional title and the removal of references to the EU flag and anthem, although these will, of course, continue to be widely used throughout the Union.  Moreover, the charter of fundamental rights has been taken out of the treaty, but will retain its legally-binding status.  National parliaments have been given an enhanced role in the Union's legislative process.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">There will be an opt-in/opt-out arrangement for the UK in the field of criminal and police co-operation.  We will need to decide in the coming months whether to join that arrangement.  Although the double majority voting system will not come into use until 2014, the overall institutional package from the 2004 agreement has not been reopened.  This was a key requirement of ours throughout these negotiations.  Ireland also succeeded in getting agreement to include commitments on combating climate change in the new treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">As regards the charter, the Government wanted it to be incorporated in the reform treaty, but this was opposed by a number of member states.  We are happy that its legal standing will be confirmed in the new treaty.  In our view, the text of the charter itself and the wording to be included in the treaty adequately define the scope and application of the charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">At a very late stage in the negotiations, the UK delegation introduced a protocol which seeks to clarify the application of the charter as regards its own national laws.  While we have no difficulty with the charter and do not believe that such clarification is required in our case, we nevertheless considered it prudent to look for an opportunity to study the implications of the protocol for the charter and its application.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I am glad the Taoiseach has clarified the situation regarding reports that Ireland has sought a derogation.  The charter refers to human dignity, the right to life, the right to integrity of the person and the prohibition of slavery and enforced labour so why has Ireland reserved this position on it when many such issues are already enshrined in Irish law?  Why is it that we are being a third party to grandstanding by the United Kingdom?</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Given that the Minister of State said we are examining the legal implications for Ireland of Britain's stance, when will we have a final position on the charter?  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of the biggest selling points for all of the major parties in this House in the approach to a referendum and taking a reserved position creates doubts.  Many doubts have already been created by reports in the media.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I fully appreciate the Deputy's concerns given some of the reports in the media but the Government has no reservations regarding the charter.  As I said in my reply, it is prudent to take the opportunity to examine the implications for the charter of this additional protocol, which was introduced at a very late stage.  As the Taoiseach and I have said previously, the additional protocol seems excessive given that the field of application section in the charter makes it clear that the charter applies to the institutions of the European Union and member states as they apply legislation.  It is wise to review the implications for the charter, although we do not have concerns about the charter  itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I, like the Deputy, regard the charter as a major selling point, not just in the constitutional treaty process but in the reform treaty process.

The only issues that arose were the British concerns regarding the protocol.</p>

         if, in the context of the new proposed European Treaty, he envisages new mechanisms for making decisions on common, foreign and security policy accountable to parliamentarians within the European Union; if the proposed Foreign Minister of the European Union will be accountable to the European Parliament; and if in turn decisions taken on CFSP will require the assent and scrutiny of committees of the European Parliament to which such functions have been delegated or plenary sessions of such parliaments.

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_116">One of the key purposes of the reform treaty, which is due to be finalised by the end of the year in accordance with the Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, mandate agreed by the European Council, will be to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the Union and to strengthen its institutions, including the European Parliament.  The treaty will give considerable additional influence to the European Parliament by extending the number of areas of EU legislation in which there will be a co-decision role for the European Parliament alongside the Council of Ministers.  Another key objective of the reform treaty will be to give greater coherence to the Union's external policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The European Union mandate for the IGC on the new reform treaty confirms that the common foreign and security policy, CFSP, will remain essentially political and intergovernmental in character.  The role of the European Parliament on CFSP will therefore remain consultative, with decisions on Common Positions and joint actions continuing to be made by the Council of Ministers, in accordance with general guidelines defined by the European Council.   The specific roles of the European Parliament and Commission in this area are defined in the treaties.  Consultation between the Council and Parliament on CFSP has greatly increased in recent years.  During the Irish Presidency an extraordinary amount of the European Parliament's time was spent addressing areas outside the central focus of the original treaties.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">The establishment of the post of high representative of the Union for foreign affairs and security policy, as provided for in the reform treaty, will enhance the coherence and effectiveness of the Union's external relations.  The high representative will consult and inform the European Parliament on the CFSP and will ensure its views are duly taken into consideration.  Javier Solana has established a very good relationship with the Parliament.  There is also provision for special representatives appointed to deal with external issues to brief the European Parliament on their areas of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Ireland has consistently supported the intergovernmental character of the CFSP, which we regard as most appropriate for the safeguarding of our interests.  The Government acknowledges the importance of appropriate consultation with the European Parliament on CFSP issues, given its position of co-responsibility in relation to the Union budget.  We welcome the improved level of consultation and interaction occurring between the Council and Parliament across the range of issues on the Union's wider agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I am grateful to the Minister of State for his long reply, about which I will ask a complex supplementary question.  The question I tabled was about accountability and I propose to make the matter simple.  The European Parliament can have access to information on the Common Foreign and Security Policy it but has no right of decision.  While it can summon people to appear before it, areas which are matters for intergovernmental competence will, as the Minister of State noted, remain matters for intergovernmental competence.  The question of accountability then runs on to national parliaments.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">I asked what additional accountability mechanisms would be available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the plenary session of any member state parliament and to whom the new foreign minister of the European Union would report.  I can concentrate the matter by putting the question in a concrete way.  In 2003, a sub-committee of the permanent ambassadors of COREPER, the clearing committee consisting of five people, decided to add Hamas to a list of proscribed organisations.  This decision had immense implications for Middle East policy.  A common position was also announced in response to elections in Palestine in 2006.  There was no accountability for these decisions in the plenary session of the Oireachtas, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the European Parliament, which organises regular visits to Palestine but has no competence in this area.  It is proposed that this absence of accountability will continue in the intergovernmental process and the proposed new post.  I have serious reservations about the unaccountable positions taken up by Javier Solana, particularly on the Middle East.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">As I stated and Deputy Higgins presaged, the CFSP, by its nature, will remain substantially intergovernmental.

            <p eId="para_128">Before turning to the situation in the West Bank and Gaza, I would like to emphasise our continuing strong support for the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, and for its democratically-elected Government, a sentiment which I believe is shared on all sides of the House.  The recent violence, in an already tense political situation, is a reminder of the dangers of instability in Lebanon.  I would like in particular to express the sympathy of the Government with the families of the six members of the Spanish UNIFIL contingent who were killed in a car bomb explosion in southern Lebanon on 24 June.  It is important that I also place on record again the appreciation of the Government for the dedication of the members of the Permanent Defence Force, who are serving with such distinction in Ireland's UNIFIL contingent.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">The appalling violence in Gaza last month represents a further tragedy for the Palestinian people.  The root cause of the current crisis is the absence of a credible political process leading to a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June condemned the violence and the takeover by Hamas in Gaza.  It supported the call by the Arab League for the restoration of Palestinian national unity and the unity of Palestinian territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The European Union has expressed its full support for President Mahmoud Abbas and underlined the need for a political solution to the crisis.  The Union has supported the President's decision to form an emergency government and the Council decided to begin work on developing the conditions for urgent practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The European Union increased its overall assistance to the Palestinian people last year to almost €700 million, of which some €340 million came from the Community budget.  Already this year, €320 million has been allocated in Community aid for humanitarian assistance, direct payments to Palestinians through the temporary international mechanism, and technical assistance and institution building.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The EU is determined to continue to provide emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza, which is facing a serious humanitarian crisis.  The majority of the population in Gaza is dependent on services provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, to which the EU has already contributed €90 million this year.  It is essential that all parties, including the Israeli authorities, guarantee unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">I should add that the main cause of the financial crisis in the Palestinian Authority has been the withholding by Israel of tax and customs revenues since April 2006.  The EU has called on the Israeli Government to release these revenues immediately, and Prime Minister Olmert indicated at last week's summit in Sharm El Sheikh that some funds would be unfrozen.  I welcome the transfer of €119 million on 1 July, and I call on Israel to release the total remaining amount without further delay.  I also welcome the Israeli Government's announcement that the normal monthly transfer of revenues will be resumed this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The Government increased Ireland's assistance to the Palestinians by 40% in 2006 to €6.4 million.  Ireland's assistance will increase further this year.  In January, during a visit to Bethlehem, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a 25% increase in support for UNRWA to €3.8 million this year.  We have made a clear commitment to maintaining this increased level of funding over the next three years.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">Reference was made earlier to accountability with regard to decisions.  One of the most disgraceful decisions made without accountability to this House was the support of the Government for the decision made by the European Union to terminate funding to the Palestinian Authority last year.  Some of us in the House forecast that the serious humanitarian situation brought about in Palestine would undermine the credibility and support for the Palestinian Authority and Fatah, and would strengthen the presence of the extremist groups, such as Hamas.  This has come to fruition.  What has happened in Palestine in recent times is as a direct result of the undermining of Fatah and the curtailment of funding, which proceeded from the holding of funds by Israel.  Does the Minister accept there is a need for a new initiative to strengthen, if belatedly, the position of Fatah?</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Was the Government consulted about the appointment of the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, as special envoy to the Middle East and, if so, what was the opinion of the Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_138">The Deputy raises two separate issues.  First, the most practical example of support for the Government in Palestine is the €320 million which the Union has provided.  In so far as the Government is concerned, we increased our assistance to the Palestinians by 40% last year to €6.4 million.  The Deputy made a passing reference to the withholding of tax moneys by the Israeli authorities.  Thankfully, that has stopped——</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard Allen</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs about</b>
         the humanitarian situation in Darfur; when the full peacekeeping force will be in place; the latest contact his Department has had with the Government of Sudan and surrounding countries in respect of the crisis situation there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_82" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_148">The Government continues to be deeply concerned about the crisis in Darfur and its spillover into neighbouring territory in Chad and the Central African Republic.  We are pursuing all avenues to support international efforts to address the grave humanitarian, political and security challenges faced there.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">On the ground in Darfur the humanitarian situation remains very difficult.  Civilians, humanitarian workers and the members of the African Union Mission in Sudan, AMIS, are being targeted on an ongoing basis.  A further 150,000 civilians have been displaced this year, in addition to the 2 million already displaced, the majority of whom have not been able to return home.  The difficulties being faced by UN agencies and NGOs are a particular concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">Ireland continues to make a strong contribution to international efforts to alleviate this human tragedy.  In the period 2004-07 Irish Aid provided €29.7 million in emergency and recovery funding for Sudan, of which €19 million was specifically for Darfur.  Since 2006 Ireland has provided €3.31 million in humanitarian aid for the Central Africa Republic and €3.5 million for Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">Following sustained political pressure from the international community, on 12 June the Government of Sudan approved the proposed UN-African Union hybrid peacekeeping mission.  On 22 June the African Union authorised deployment of the mission and agreed that it should be strongly mandated to protect civilians, support the peace process and work towards the establishment of the secure environment needed for the sustainable return of internally displaced people.  Discussions are now ongoing in New York on a new UN Security Council resolution that would pave the way for UN funding for the hybrid mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The Government played an active role in the international efforts to address the underlying political crisis in Sudan which led to the breakthrough on the hybrid mission.  In his meetings with the Sudanese Foreign Minister in Khartoum in July 2006 and in New York in September 2006 the Minister for Foreign Affairs urged the Government of Sudan to agree to UN engagement in peacekeeping in Darfur.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met the Minister of Economy, Planning and International Co-operation of the Central African Republic on 8 February to discuss the situation there.  The Government has also been working closely with our European partners in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">For example, on 18 June EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their support for the United Nations' work in establishing a multi-dimensional UN presence in eastern Chad and the north east of the Central African Republic.  The Government will continue to accord the highest priority to tackling the humanitarian, political and security challenges in the Darfur region of Sudan and neighbouring countries and will remain closely engaged in international efforts to resolve all aspects of this crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">The situation in Sudan is appalling — hundreds of thousands have been killed, 3 million are displaced and depend on humanitarian aid, and security is needed.  The Minister of State said discussions were taking place at the United Nations about the hybrid force on which the United Nations, the African Union and the Sudanese Government agreed.  Surely it is time for action.  As the days pass more people are killed and displaced.  When does the Minister of State think there will be a final decision on the configuration of the so-called hybrid force which should have been in place yesterday?</p>

            <p eId="para_156">I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy.  There seems to be an extraordinary delay in concluding these issues.  Diplomacy involves excessive discussion of the issues and one can only hope this will produce action.

            <p eId="para_158">On the last point, as we have received no request, that matter has not been discussed.  The European Union and the Government have implemented a range of arms embargoes on Sudan since 1994.  Over the past few months the Foreign Ministers have repeatedly emphasised their readiness to consider further measures, within the UN framework, against the party which obstructs towards the AU-UN hybrid force.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_162">The rationale for the establishment of the conflict resolution unit, and its broad objectives, were set out in the Government's White Paper on Irish Aid, which was published last September.  The unit was set up last autumn and is leading work within the Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with Irish Aid and the Anglo-Irish division, on the preparation of a detailed draft initial plan.  It is undertaking extensive research on, and analysis of, conflict resolution initiatives elsewhere, possible themes and regions of focus and the identification of possible future partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">The work plan will, of course, reflect the targets set out in the programme for Government, which underscored the importance of conflict resolution as a theme in our foreign policy.  The programme for Government includes commitments to the appointment of a number of roving ambassadors to crisis regions and to an enhanced stability fund of €25 million annually.  The programme for Government also indicates the intention to establish an academic centre which will help deliver on the conflict resolution unit's mandate to work with academic institutions, civil society organisations and other potential partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">More broadly, the conflict resolution initiative will enable us, where possible and appropriate, to facilitate elsewhere the peaceful outcome of conflicts and apply the lessons we have learned through the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">This is an exciting but challenging set of goals, the full implementation of which will inevitably require time and patience and will involve a certain amount of experimentation.  It will also require intensive co-ordination nationally and internationally.  We must ensure that the areas and themes on which we choose to focus are appropriate for us and that we can deliver on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">As I mentioned in my reply, work is being done in this regard in two sections in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The Deputy raised a very interesting question on the establishment of the consultative group on the past.  We are at a new and positive stage in the political process in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has welcomed the announcement of the consultative group to examine the issues that arise when dealing with the past.  The group, which is jointly chaired by experienced and respected representatives, will report next summer.  The Minister understands that the group will look at the broader issues of how to approach the legacy of conflict rather than focus on individual cases.  There remain a number of bodies and inquiries looking at specific cases, including the Bloody Sunday inquiry.  We do not underestimate the fact that this is a very complex area.  We wish the process well but it will be some time before the results crystallise.</p>

          <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_103" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_187">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 114, 157, 175, 292 and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">I have already set out the broad lines of the Government's policy on the Middle East peace process in my reply to Question No. 85.  The root cause of the current crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories is the absence of a credible political process for a viable two-state solution.  The Government has argued strongly that the EU can play a more effective role directly and within the Quartet in seeking to revive the peace process.  The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 18 June recognised the urgency of the situation, following the terrible violence in Gaza and the effective collapse of the national unity Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The EU strongly supports the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to avert further chaos in the Palestinian territories, including his decision under Palestinian law to establish an emergency government.  We will support all efforts to restore Palestinian unity and to establish a political consensus around the concept of a two-state solution.  The EU is gravely concerned by the critical humanitarian situation in Gaza and determined to maintain its vital assistance to the people of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">The EU has never cut its assistance to the Palestinians.  Overall EU assistance increased to almost €700 million in 2006, around €340 million of which came from the European Community budget.  The decision to suspend direct assistance to the Palestinian Government formed in March 2006 was based on the refusal of Hamas to commit to the core principles of the peace process. However, the EU maintained its assistance through the office of the President of the Palestinian Authority and took the lead internationally by establishing the temporary international mechanism to channel payments directly to the Palestinian population. Until the recent violence, the EU was working closely with the Minister of Finance of the national unity Government on the gradual restoration of direct assistance.  The Council on 18 June decided to begin work immediately on arrangements for urgent practical assistance to the Palestinian Authority.  This will include direct financial support to the Government, support for the Palestinian civilian police and intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian state.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">It is both wasteful and a tragedy that the Palestinian people are now so dependent on international assistance, especially as the outlines of the only possible political solution to the conflict have been so well rehearsed.  All parties must meet their responsibilities in creating the conditions which will enable movement towards a political settlement.  They must also respect their obligations under international law.  The EU will continue to call on Israel to end all policies which threaten to undermine the viability of a two-state solution, notably the illegal expansion of settlements and construction of the separation barrier on occupied Palestinian land.  We in Ireland have learned painfully that there are no security or military solutions to the problems of divided societies, or to conflicts on the sharing of territory.  Our Government will continue to support all those Israeli and Palestinian leaders with the courage to make the difficult compromises needed for the establishment of a lasting peace.</p>

Will the Minister of State agree that that decision was short-sighted, that it led to an appalling humanitarian situation in Palestine, strengthened the hand of Hamas and has effectively driven Fatah out of the Gaza region?

On the contrary, it has led to a schism down the middle of the country and internecine strife between the two communities in Palestine.  Will the Minister not seek immediately to have all official EU funding restored to the officials in Palestine because what they are experiencing currently makes our troubles in the North look minor?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_199">The Deputy cannot suggest, by any reasonable extension, that the European Union was responsible for the schism, to use his word, which resulted in the dreadful events in the recent past.  There can be no doubt that any solution will have to involve Hamas but the arrangements the European Union took at the time was to make sure funding got to the people, which is most important.</p>

            <p eId="para_200">Is the Minister standing over the first unaccountable decision in 2003 where a sub-committee of civil servants known as the clearing house, formed from the permanent representatives to the European Union, COREPER, had Hamas proscribed, which stopped it participating in political discussion and raising money?  I am sure the Minister does not want to mislead the House but is he aware that the European Union stopped funding in 2006 in yet another unaccountable decision?  It found an alternative stream for humanitarian relief but not the full funding.  In November 2006, having encouraged Hamas to participate in elections, the European Union issued a statement welcoming the fact that the elections had been peaceful but not accepting the result.  Is the Minister of State aware that in the presence of the senior Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, President Carter referred to the elections as perhaps the fairest and most peaceful the Carter Center had observed and that it was he who said he was outraged that the Irish Government, with other Governments, in an unaccountable decision, decided to act in such a way as destabilised the Palestinian people?</p>

            <p eId="para_201">I accept the Deputy's point that the temporary international mechanism was a less than perfect solution but it was an honest, if imperfect, approach to get in funding.  I note the Deputy's concerns about the manner in which decisions are made at the edges of COREPER II and I will pass those comments and concerns on to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, although I am sure the Deputy has already done so.

Does the Minister agree that the decision by the EU to withdraw funding from the Palestinian Authority further compounded the humanitarian situation in Palestine, with high levels of unemployment, especially in the public sector?  Is he aware also that the conclusions of that committee state that the withdrawal of funding might put Hamas into a corner which encourages violence rather than negotiation and that the international community must ensure it is not bolstering one faction against another, thereby increasing the risk of internal strife?</p>

Does the Minister agree with that assertion and, if so, will he now press the EU to take concrete actions to persuade that Government to end its occupation of Palestine, including through the activation of the human rights clauses of the association agreement between the EU and Israel, which provide for the suspension of preferential trade?  Will the Minister progress that?</p>

I have not heard the House of Commons report to which he refers but I have already referred to the Government's view on the actions by the Israeli Government over the years and our welcome for the fact that, very belatedly, as Deputy Allen pointed out, funds due to the Palestinian Authority which could have been helpful have been released.</p>

Will the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, use the experience gained in our peace process to assist the Palestinian people?  I refer in particular to the current civil war between Fatah and Hamas.  Could we use the experience gained in our peace process, particularly in the past few years, to assist them?  I am saddened by the civil war that is taking place.  Will the Minister of State use Ireland's influence abroad, particularly in the Middle East, to assist the Palestinian people because they are in dire straits and they need our urgent help?</p>

            <p eId="para_210">I agree with the Deputy on the last point.  Rather than factionalise the people it is a great tragedy that all the Palestinian people cannot focus on help.  I made the point in an earlier response to Deputy Allen that we have some experience that hundreds of years of fighting and killing achieves nothing.  A few years of political courage focused on talking can provide solutions.  This tragedy for the Palestinian people and the relationship between Palestine and Israel will only be resolved by honest negotiations and by people taking the view that there is benefit in listening to every side in an argument.  It has been the view of successive Irish Governments that the two-state solution, in which people can live side by side in peace, harmony and tranquility, is the appropriate way forward.  The Deputy is right.  Ireland can bring some experiences to the international table.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">The only point on which I disagreed with the Deputy was the characterisation that it was decisions made about payments that created the current situation.  On whether it causes hardship, of course it does.  Withholding any form of revenue from any side causes hardship.  However, the European Union made an honest effort and, as I stated, even an imperfect effort through the arrangements which I have already described, to fund support directly to the people who needed it.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">Would the Minister of State agree that one of the great contrasts between the Northern Ireland achievement and the Middle East is that the Northern Ireland talks had a secretariat attached?  If the European Union was serious about the roadmap for peace and the Quartet, it would have established a secretariat to serve the proposals of the Quartet.  It did not do so, and neither did the European Union condemn outright the building of the wall that divides Palestinians from their own lands, nor did it seek to vindicate the International Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">Is the Minister of State aware of the widespread public opinion in Ireland that Ireland has no longer an independent opinion on the Middle East crisis, that it has buried itself within an unaccountable position that has excluded many Palestinians from what are their revenues?  I put it to him that it is not true to state that the taxes withheld have been restored to Palestinians.  They have not.  Part of them have been restored to some of the Palestinians, particularly those in the Fatah Party who are loyal to Mahmoud Abbas.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
            <p eId="para_240">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 102, 117, 128, 133, 134, 160, 278, 286 and 287 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">I refer the Deputies to my response to Priority Question No. 86, in which I dealt with the timescale for the deployment for the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur and the humanitarian situation, including the plight of the displaced in Darfur.  I will respond to the other points raised by Deputies on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">In co-operation with our international partners, the Government is using all avenues to address the crisis in Darfur.  Earlier this year, Darfur was raised by the Taoiseach in meetings with UN Secretary General and President Bush and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his meetings with representatives of states and organisations capable of influencing Sudan including Egypt, the Arab League and the UN.  Both underlined Ireland's support for deployment of an effective joint UN-African Union hybrid peacekeeping force and for improved humanitarian access in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">The Government has also worked closely with our EU partners to end human rights abuse and improve humanitarian access in Darfur.  Most recently, as I mentioned, the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 June condemned Khartoum's renewed bombing of civilians and stated that the EU is ready to consider further measures, notably in the UN framework, to ensure humanitarian deliveries and the protection of civilians.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">Ireland has actively encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to address human rights abuses in Darfur.  We supported its special session on Darfur and its decision in March this year to establish a UN group to work with Sudan on implementing core human rights recommendations in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_245">Lasting improvements in the humanitarian and security situations will, however, require progress in the political process.  In this context, the Government welcomes the roadmap for the Darfur peace process already proposed by the African Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_246">Many of the displaced in southern Sudan have been returning to their homes since the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005.  However, the currently slow and piecemeal implementation of the agreement threatens to disrupt progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_247">The provision of food, shelter and basic medical care for those in need has been a prime focus of Ireland's humanitarian funding in Sudan.  Our main partner organisations, including the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme and Irish NGOs such as Concern, Goal, and Trócaire, prioritise the forms of engagement.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">Ireland welcomes the new energy which President Sarkozy's government is bringing to consideration of the situation in Sudan.  The meeting on Sudan in Paris on 25 June has reinforced international support for the AU/UN roadmap for the Darfur peace process and underlined the need for quick deployment of the hybrid force.  I particularly welcome the fact that China was represented at a senior level at the Paris conference, as I mentioned already to Deputy Allen who expressed a specific interest in this area.  That is a positive development.</p>

            <p eId="para_249">Is the Minister of State in a position to state what conclusions the Irish Government has drawn from the attendance of China at the Paris conference?  What precise results may flow from that?</p>
            <p eId="para_250">Will he indicate the shortfall in funding for the hybrid force, whether the existing African Union force is underfunded, where such underfunding is sourced and what it reveals politically?</p>
            <p eId="para_251">Will the Minister of State discuss the implications that arise in common territory shared by refugee camps and neighbouring Chad, and the difficult conditions in which the refugee population find themselves in the border areas?</p>

            <p eId="para_252">On the latter point, it involves not just Darfur but also the border areas.  I mentioned already the Irish Government's support for humanitarian activity in Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_253">On the first part of Deputy Higgins's question, as I stated already the engagement of China in this could be very positive.  Chinese engagement typically has been characterised for all sorts of propagandist reasons as negative elsewhere, but I hope it will be positive.  China has become a significant player in the region.  It has a role to play in assisting.  Clearly, it can do so and can be positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">Is it a fact, despite the rhetorical engagement with the tragedy that is Darfur, that the funding for the African Union force is tragically short, the funding for the replacement force is not yet in place, and some of the principal powers that attended the Paris conference are in default on funding?</p>

            <p eId="para_262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 126, 135 and 156 together.  Ireland is satisfied with the outcome to the recent European Council which agreed a mandate for a forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to finalise the proposed reform treaty.  The mandate secured political agreement on a range of issues connected with the new treaty.  The purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference is to turn this political agreement into a legal text that can be signed before the end of the year.  We will approach the upcoming negotiations in a constructive manner with a view to creating an effective European Union that is equipped to serve the interests of our citizens and meet the many challenges facing Europe in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">The new reform treaty, when it is concluded, will contain a series of important amendments to the Treaty on European Union and the treaty establishing the European Community.  These amendments will be drawn very substantially from the draft constitutional treaty agreed during the Irish Presidency in 2004.  The reform treaty will allow the Union of 27 member states to function more effectively.  Its principal innovations will include a president of the European Council; a high representative of the Union for foreign affairs and security policy and a newly constituted Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_264">The treaty will increase the influence of the European Parliament and also give an enhanced role to national parliaments, thus strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the European Union.  It will introduce the use of qualified majority voting across a range of issues, which is necessary in a Union of 27.</p>
            <p eId="para_265">Ireland fully supports the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was a key feature of the draft constitutional treaty.  The reform treaty will contain a clause confirming the legally binding status of the charter.  When the UK delegation introduced a protocol at a late stage in the European Council negotiations, we considered it prudent to seek an opportunity to study its implications.</p>

            <p eId="para_266">Last week I asked the Minister of State if the Government would pursue the right to an opt-out of State aid provisions at the upcoming IGC.  What point has been reached?  The Minister of State said: "In general we do not like such clauses for the simple reason that it makes the process extraordinarily cumbersome.  It is far better to be part of the mainstream and to negotiate positions."  Will the Minister of State ensure that such an opt-out is part of the mainstream and that other countries will also benefit from an opt-out or the section will be taken out altogether?  I refer to the opt-out on State aid provisions, which are overly restrictive and make it impossible for member states to use redistributive tools, such as targeted State funding, to full effect in order to achieve objectives.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">The Taoiseach has stated on a number of occasions that he should be congratulated on the state of the health services.  On the last day of some accountability in this forum, what are the Government's proposals in respect of front-line staff in the health services?  The Taoiseach may recall that on 31 March, a document issued and signed by the director of human resources for the HSE indicated that as a result of a Government directive up to 1,000 job cuts would have to take place by the end of 2007.  The directive, referenced 04/2002, stated that 29 jobs would be cut from corporate functions, 959 from hospital or primary and community case services.  In that figure, Cork University Hospital will lose 25 staff and the maternity unit at the hospital, which is already understaffed, will lose six staff.  Even the hospital closest to the Taoiseach's heart, the Mater, will lose 23 staff and the hospital for sick children will lose 13.  On the radio the Taoiseach confirmed that the Government did not mind if these were front-line staff or not.  The Minister for Health and Children stated that the current level of services would have to be delivered by 1,000 fewer staff.  If we have a world class health service, why could we not reform this to protect front-line staff, given the massive administrative bureaucracy that exists in the HSE?</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I and other Members know of front-line staff, particularly nurses, who had scheduled holidays but were called back because staff were not available to cover them.  This is a real problem.  Did the Government direct the HSE to reduce staff by 1,000?  The directive states: "As part of the Government's decision to authorise a new approved employment ceiling, there is a requirement on the HSE to effect a 1,000 whole-time equivalent reduction by the end of 2007."  What is in store for front-line staff — nurses, ambulance drivers, and doctors as distinct from the massive bureaucratic bulge that exists in the central portion of the HSE?  Is the directive correct and is it the consequence of a Government decision that 1,000 whole-time equivalent staff are to be cut by the end of the year?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_154">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_277">Complements of staff and existing approved ceilings of staff are decided at the beginning of each year across the health service and the public sector.  The HSE must work within the figures but it decides how this will be broken down in its budgets under the normal headings of consultants, junior doctors, nurses and allied staff, paramedical staff and administrative and catering staff.   The figure for last year in the Health Service Executive was 108,000 whole-time equivalents.  There were no cutbacks in the health service.  The staff were sanctioned subject to certain conditions, as happens in every sector, across Departments and local authorities.  Last year there was an increase of 10,000 on the existing approved ceiling and this year is the same.  The health sector is substantially over expenditure for the first half of the year across most sub-headings.  Perhaps the HSE is operating what it calls a reduction on what it has allowed to be approved but it is certainly not under the ceiling.  At the end of 2006, the ceiling was 108,000 whole-time equivalents.  That represents an increase of 10,450 staff over the existing approved ceiling.  This year is running at the same level.  There are no cutbacks in the Department of Health and Children.  The Department has conveyed sanction for a revised employment ceiling, which it does every year, but it certainly is not showing any reduction; it is showing a substantial increase.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_278">The responsibility for the health service lies with the Government, not with the HSE.  I have here the document from the Health Service Executive which states clearly there is a requirement on the HSE to effect a 1,000 whole-time equivalent reduction by the end of 2007.  On 22 May 2007 the Minister for Health and Children, who obviously cannot be here because of her family bereavement, agreed with an interviewer that current services would be delivered by 1,000 fewer employees.  She agreed that statement was correct.  The Taoiseach stated on the following day, 23 May 2007, this was the first he had heard about this cutback.  He continued to state the document referred to by the HSE had or has no status and was irrelevant.  When it suits the Government, it states it is a function for the HSE to determine certain matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Taoiseach is aware also that the finance section of the HSE comprises more than 1,000 staff.  A study of that function found at least 380 of those jobs were superfluous.  There has been an orgy of promotions within the administrative ranks of the HSE.  At a time when the Taoiseach will not be present in the House again until 26 September, I am concerned front-line staff in critical areas of the delivery of public health services will be cut.  This document states, consequent on a decision by the Government, led by the Taoiseach, 1,000 jobs must be cut by the end of 2007.  The Minister for Health and Children agreed with that.  The Taoiseach stated the document had no status and that it was the first he heard of cuts.  Who is telling the truth or does it matter any more in this House?</p>

The Department of Health and Children conveyed sanction for a revised employment ceiling for the health service for the end of 2006 of 108,000 whole-time equivalents, subject to certain conditions.  This represents an increase of 10,400 on the existing approved ceiling.  If I understand Deputy Kenny's argument correctly, it is that there is a reduction of 1,000 staff.  If he is saying——</p>

The first point he made is that a cutback has been made by the HSE in its staff complement.  That is not the case.  The HSE is way over its staff complement.  The second point is the HSE should be using its figures, not on front-line staff or sensitive areas, which I accept, but in other areas.  Deputy Kenny is correct, there have been significant increases in recent years in administrative promotional posts throughout the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">Will the Taoiseach outline the Government's response to the huge seizure of drugs, on which I am sure he has a note?  Even by international standards the seizure was huge.  According to Revenue it was worth €100 million while some of the newspapers suggested it was worth €300 million.  Given the United Nations assessment that approximately 10% of the drugs coming through this country are seized, that is an enormous accidental confiscation.  That is the point; this was entirely accidental.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">According to a Customs and Excise enforcement officer from the Revenue, drug smugglers regard Ireland as a soft touch.  Do we know whether other similar consignments have come through in the same way, or do we have any information about them?  What steps does the Government intend to take to ensure this country does not continue to be a soft touch?  Having regard to the fact we do not have a coastline protection service like other states, does the Taoiseach intend to take any measures in that regard?  For example, does he intend to better resource Customs and Excise or the Naval Service?  Is the Taoiseach concerned some Garda sources are saying this consignment was intended for other jurisdictions?  The suggestion is such an enormous quantity of drugs could be transported through this jurisdiction, without hindrance, to Britain or wherever.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Does the Taoiseach believe adequate steps are being taken by the Government in terms of reducing demand for drugs in this jurisdiction, having regard to the fact this is no longer a Dublin or even urban phenomenon, but that it is experienced in every town and village in Ireland?  The extent of abuse and misuse of drugs is widespread.  According to the United Nations, for example, it is considered cocaine use is increasing at a higher rate in Ireland than in any developed country.  The UN stated the number of cocaine related offences has increased fourfold between 2002 and 2005.  It also stated drugs worth €100 million were seized by the Garda in 2006.  If it is the case that approximately 10% of drugs coming here are seized, one can imagine the amount of drugs that are manifestly getting through.  It has been shown that 70% of wastewater samples taken from Dublin and surrounding areas contained traces of cocaine.  There is an endemic, serious, widespread phenomenon of drug abuse and misuse in this jurisdiction.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied the Government is taking adequate steps to cope with this phenomenon?</p>

          <p eId="para_292">A number of questions arise from this seizure and the attempted landing in west Cork of cocaine.  I am told the street value of the haul would be well in excess of €100 million.  Much depends on how it is mixed.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">It would certainly be worth more than €100 million.  This is a matter of serious concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The Garda, Naval Service and Customs and Excise service are all involved in the recovery and investigation process.  While it is too early to draw conclusions about the source of the drugs or their intended destination, this will emerge from the investigations.  In the past number of years, there has been evidence of increased cocaine smuggling by maritime traffic into Europe from the Caribbean and South America, which often involves leisure craft landing in remote locations.  While Ireland has experienced seizures of that nature in the past few years, the coasts of Spain and Portugal appear to be the main known landing locations.  However, it is clear from yesterday's events that remote inlets also constitute targets for smugglers.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The Revenue Commissioner's maritime unit acquired a cutter three years ago that carries out surveillance and interception operations at sea as determined by the assessment of risk of illicit activity or by intelligence reports.  Revenue regularly reviews the adequacy of the resources in this regard and of course will take yesterday's event into account.  The cutter has been on the scene since yesterday morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Intelligence is the key to success in this regard and the Customs and Excise service has close contacts with its counterparts in other countries regarding deal movements.  As for Deputy Rabbitte's question on what is happening to improve this, we are participating with a number of other countries in the establishment of the maritime operations analysis centre for narcotics in Lisbon.  This is a direct response to the growing threat of cocaine smuggling into Europe from South America and the Caribbean.  It is well under way and I have been briefed that most of the work on it has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">This is a significant initiative and is intended to focus on targeting the sea cocaine routes into the European Union.  It will collect and analyse operational information, enhance intelligence through better information exchange, ascertain the availability of assets to facilitate interaction in accordance with the national laws of the participants and will involve the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, France and the Netherlands in participation in the centre's work.  While it is hoped the agreement in this regard will be finalised before the summer break, it has been ongoing for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">In addition to international intelligence, obviously a key role exists in respect of the activities of people in coastal areas.  We have had a number of seizures of cocaine on the coasts.  As I understand that one was valued at €40 million and another at €50 million, it is obvious that there are significant movements.  This one is exceptionally large and obviously we were lucky to intercept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Much of the intelligence in this regard comes from Interpol and from other sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">As for the quantity, an incident of this nature leads to speculation about successful and undetected attempts to import drugs.  While I cannot state whether such attempts have taken place, when one considers an attempt of this nature one may assume it was unlikely to have been the first.  Although the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that global seizures of cocaine amount to 44% of cocaine production, I do not know how one estimates such a figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">As it has done, the Government will continue to provide all the resources necessary to the Naval Service, Revenue and the agencies involved in order that they can take all reasonable steps to counteract this deadly trade.  However, it has been 15 years since this issue regarding the need for greater co-operation and resources to try to cover the coastline was debated at European level.  Obviously, the various coastlines across Europe have been used and seizures have taken place in half a dozen countries in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">As for the amount of cocaine in particular coming into society generally, including Ireland, and being used here, most of the intelligence suggests that such very large consignments find their way into Europe.  While the initial view in this instance is that it could have been bound for the United Kingdom, I am informed this cannot be substantiated and it will take some time before that will happen.  Two people have been arrested, there are other suspects in the west Cork region and Garda investigations are continuing.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">It was a complete accident, totally due to weather conditions and no intelligence was obtained.  The Taoiseach clearly does not know any more than do I about whether this was a regular feature.  We do not know whether similar consignments got through.  Moreover, the Taoiseach has not really commented on the adequacy of the coastal, naval or customs services.  I noted that the principal customs officer in the region stated that Ireland was regarded as a soft touch.  The entire resources available to the Customs and Excise service consist of a single small boat to police the entire coastline and nothing that happens in Lisbon will change this.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the review the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, told my colleague, Deputy Burton, would be carried out on the airports.  This followed a similar consignment, albeit not of this scale, that came through Weston Aerodrome and the discovery in the House that not only was that aerodrome not licensed for such traffic but that there is no customs invigilation there.  I gather there is only a part-time customs service in other airports I will not name.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">This appears to constitute Ireland's state of preparation to deal with a phenomenon that is literally killing some of our citizens and ravaging some of our communities.  We seem entirely unprepared for it, given the existence of an airport within 20 miles of O'Connell Street at which one could land a private craft laden with drugs without anyone even asking one's destination and given that the Customs and Excise service depends on a single small boat.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">This is a serious issue and people working with the national drugs strategy will state that insufficient back-up is being given to those who are concerned with attempting to reduce demand for drugs.  This is also a very important part of the solution, namely, to reduce demand for drugs here.  I do not take much comfort from the Taoiseach's comments.  The event that took place off Goleen was a complete accident.  We cannot claim we had any intelligence or capability to combat it.  It is one of these things and the sheer size of it is amazing, even by international standards.  It puts the haul in "The French Connection" into the penny halfpenny place.  It will be a cause of grave concern to many parents nationwide to think that such a cargo can be landed here, transported through, some of it sold to another jurisdiction and inadequate provision of resources made to our authorities to combat it.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">However, there is no point in my trying to suggest there are no criminal elements using different orders of boats to land drugs through any of our inlets and ports as we have had a number of such seizures in the past five years.  The authorities have now caught a few hundred million euro worth of drugs.  There have been seizures to the value of €40 million, €50 million and €100 million in this instance.  Ireland is not alone in having a coastline, which is the reason the other countries are coming together to try to operate their intelligence and security, as they do through Interpol, to give the best information in this regard.  The Deputy is correct there was no intelligence in this case and this seizure was made because of the weather conditions.  It means that international intelligence agencies must also look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Customs and excise and the Garda have special schemes and work with the coastal communities to try to seek information of this kind.  Out of this, they have moved in on a big ring.  Not alone have they got the individuals concerned, but they also have the vehicles in question and intelligence on where they believe the drugs were being moved from, which helps them in this operation.  A few years ago, they caught a yacht off the west coast, which helped to close down that ring.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">This is a lucrative market across Europe.  This morning I read a report from the Lisbon base which states that there is probably no coastline around Europe through which criminal gangs are not trying to bring in drugs.  Locations have recently been found in the UK, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and France, from which hauls have been taken.  We must watch our coastline and play our part.  We are co-operating through all the organisations, such as Interpol, the World Customs Organisation, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency.  The Garda liaises on a weekly basis with the authorities in London, Paris, the Hague and Madrid and with Interpol.  The gardaí are involved in these locations, working on their own, some undercover and some as part of customs teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">With such a huge industry which has so many sources in the world, one cannot say that the gardaí are on top of the problem.  How can you say that?  From our point of view, this incident raises a serious matter.  From the point of view of the Garda, the Naval Service and customs, we must take account of what is an enormous amount of drugs.  It does not matter which market it is for; it is damaging the lives of people.  Some of the people involved could be in this country, but certainly there are people elsewhere in Europe.  The 60 bales, with 25 kg of cocaine in each, have a street value of well over €100 million.  If mixed, the value could be multiples of that amount.  Everyone in the Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all the agencies I have mentioned must step up on the action on this matter and take account of it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_335">The Government is asking us to approve No. 10 without debate.  This represents a significant change in Standing Orders and the conduct of business on the floor of the House.  Two separate sets of motions were presented in the days leading into this week's sittings, but the Taoiseach and Chief Whip have taken only one of them.  No. 16 on today's Order Paper which directly impinges on the proposal in No. 10 has not been taken.  I urge the Taoiseach to take both motions together as  they are related and there should be an opportunity to properly discuss the import and content of both which relate specifically to Leaders' questions and access to priority questions and other such matters.  It is grossly unfair that the Government proposes to take one of these without debate and to exclude the other in its entirety.  Both motions should be taken together and there should be a full debate thereon in the Chamber.  I appeal to others in the Government configuration, particularly the Green Party which in the past protested on these benches at the failure of the Government to provide for the right of smaller parties to have their voices heard and to have access to participation in all relevant opportunities and debates in this Chamber, which this proposition will not facilitate.  Instead, it only compounds an already impossible situation for my colleagues and me.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I appeal to the Green Party Deputies and those who were formerly members of the Technical Group in the 29th Dáil to use their persuasive powers in government to ensure there is a full and inclusive debate on these matters and that they are properly resolved to reflect the rights of five Deputies to be recognised on the floor of the House as a technical group.  This is precisely the wording that was previously argued by the Green Party in the last Dáil.  I ask the Taoiseach in the second week of the 30th Dáil to accede to this request, allow the opportunity for Members to discuss this and related matters properly and let the decision then be taken by a free vote, not with a Whip being applied by the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Standing Order 39 relates to priority questions.  It sets out the sessional order determining the sequence in which questions nominated for priority are placed on the Order Paper each day.  It is based in the normal way on the number of seats held by each party in the House.  Standing Order 116 relates to the Private Members' business rota.  Again, it sets forth the sessional order determining the sequence in which groups in opposition are entitled to use Private Members' time.  If there are issues Deputy Ó Caoláin wants to discuss with the Government Whip, there is time to do so during the summer recess.  The sessional orders are based on the numerical strength of the parties in the House.  We must proceed accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">If they are based on numerical strength, we are surely entitled, even though our percentage may be small, to a squeak in some debates in the course of a 12-month period.  I have discussed this issue with the Chief Whip but he does not hold out much hope of the Taoiseach having a change of heart.  The latter's kicking to touch at this point will not in any way answer what I have requested.  No. 16 is absolutely relevant to No. 10.  The two should be taken together and there should be a full debate on the floor of the House.  That is the least to which we are entitled.  We are entitled to the right to participate fully and ask the Taoiseach questions during Leaders' Questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">I oppose the proposal for the reason we have set out so many times previously, namely, the entirely unnecessary guillotining of the time available for discussing the Bill.  To avoid having to stand on my feet later, I note that the Government will resort to the guillotine on no fewer than three occasions this week.  None of the measures is urgent and there is no imperative in terms of timing.  The arrangement is purely for the convenience of Ministers.  The time available for Deputies from this side of the House to contribute to the debate has been abridged, with the time available to the main speakers cut from 20 minutes to 15.  The impact of a similar arrangement last week was that some colleagues who were making their maiden speeches had three minutes in which to do so.  It is entirely unnecessary.  While the Bill may grind to its natural conclusion by 7 p.m., for the Government at the beginning of a term to resort to the regular use of the guillotine is entirely unsupportable in parliamentary terms.  Whatever about a Government in its dying days needing to have legislation under its belt, there is no excuse for it in the opening days of the term of a new Government and Dáil.  The abridgement is unjustified and I am opposing it for that reason.</p>

We should allow for a proper debate and Deputies to have the opportunity to properly participate on all Stages, even those of us who, unfortunately, have to beg to be given a few minutes to speak on Second Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_497">Last week I asked the Tánaiste, in the absence of the Taoiseach, whether the Ethics Bill that was proposed last October to keep the Progressive Democrats in power would be taken or dropped.  The Tánaiste said that it would probably be taken in the Seanad this week and that it would then return to this House, but I do not see it listed on the Order of Business for tomorrow or Thursday.  Will the Bill be taken in the Seanad and, if so, will it then come back here or will we have to wait for it until the autumn?</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Has the Taoiseach finalised a date for a referendum on the revised European treaty?  Does he intend to hold the proposed referendum on children's rights on that date or before then?  Obviously the former Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was dealing with that issue but I wish to know its current status.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Is it proposed to amend the appropriate Act to give effect to the result of the referendum held in Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis?  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, dealt with this matter.  The people voted for a change and either a ministerial order or legislation is required to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Is it proposed to change the legislation dealing with accreditation in the health services, where there are currently 83 different organisations dealing with acute care hospitals?  Many of those organisations are funded by the State.  There seems to be an extraordinary number of organisations dealing with a central feature of our public hospital system.  Is there any proposal to change that situation to provide greater clarification?</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I do not think so.  The most likely time for the EU referendum would be next summer.  The intention is that if the IGC completes its work by Christmas, the treaty would become effective by the European elections of 2009.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">We would have to have it through by that stage.  The Portuguese Presidency hopes to finish negotiations by October but even if one allows slippage to Christmas, it would then have to go forward for ratification by everybody in 2008.  I assume they will say we must have the ratification process finished by the end of 2008 if it is to be effective for the 2009 European elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The health issue was in the reform paper but I do not know if it requires legislation.  The plan was to cut down all those organisations to a small number, as outlined in the original reform paper which was published in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">We have not had any discussion on the children's referendum but we had made a commitment that it would take place within a year from the time we postponed it.  If we were doing so, it would make sense to have both referenda together, otherwise one would be asking people to vote twice in 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish the number of prosecutions that have been taken in cases of suspected television licence evasion, and the number of convictions and penalties applied.  Deputy Shortall tabled a question about the number of prosecutions taken by the Garda Síochána in respect of various motoring offences.  I have received a letter from you, a Cheann Comhairle, claiming that the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for this matter and that Deputy Ciarán Lynch should go to the Courts Service.  In the case of Deputy Shortall, I was told that the Minister has no responsibility and that she should go to the Central Statistics Office.  It is an extraordinary situation that did not obtain until this Dáil.  We are now being told that one cannot table a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the number of prosecutions in respect of different areas of the law.  We are also told that we must approach the Courts Service or the CSO to establish that.  We are rapidly reaching the situation where Ministers tell the House they have no responsibility so we should go to the HSE, NRA, CSO or the Courts Service.  Either Ministers are redundant or the Opposition is redundant in terms of trying to obtain information because we must go from one quango to another.  We will not be able to ask the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, how we are getting on with integration, which we are all watching carefully.  Will the Taoiseach agree to restore the normal service in this regard when we resume in September?</p>

The Government has also signed a Council of Europe convention on human trafficking.

          <p eId="para_593">Cúis áthais dom an deis seo a fháil chun an Bille um Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Forálacha Inghnéitheacha) 2007 a chur in bhur láthair.  Is é bunchuspóir an Bhille ná bonn comhtháite reachtúil a chinntiú don raon leathan feidhmeanna agus dualgas a thagann faoi mo choimirce mar Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.  Dá réir sin, féachann an Bille le mandáid reachtúil níos soiléire a dhaingniú do na feidhmeanna uile a aistríodh ar bhonn Ionstraimí Reachtúla nó Orduithe Aistriú Feidhmeanna, mar aon leis na cláracha nua a tionscnaíodh, ó bunaíodh mo Roinnse i Meitheamh 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 before Dáil Éireann and to outline its main provisions.  Members of the House will note that this is a short Bill, with a total of nine sections, and that many of the provisions reflected in the Bill are primarily of a technical nature.  The main purpose of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 is to confirm and secure an integrated statutory basis for the broad range of functions and responsibilities of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Essentially, the Bill aims to secure a more coherent statutory mandate for functions previously transferred to the Minister by way of statutory instrument and transfer of functions orders, with new programmes introduced since the establishment of my Department in June 2002.  In addition to this, a number of technical amendments to existing legislation are also proposed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The objectives and key features of the Bill, including the technical amendments to existing legislation, will confirm the powers, functions and responsibilities of the Minister.  The Bill will also provide for the inclusion in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 of section 18 of the Western Development Commission Act 1998 and amend section 8(5) of the Western Development Commission Act 1998, raising to €1 million the limit of financial or other material aid to enterprises or projects, which the Western Development Commission can provide without the consent of the Minister.  Section 2(4) of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003 will be amended in respect of transport services for island students, while sections 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and 3(1)(<i>c</i>) of that Act will be amended to clarify the Minister’s remit regarding specified functions in respect of new aerodromes and ancillary facilities connected with the provision of air services between the islands and the mainland.  The Bill aims to repeal the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts from 1949 to 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I will now outline on a section by section basis the key aspects of the Bill.  In line with the main purpose of the Bill which is to confirm the statutory basis for the broad range of functions and responsibilities coming within the remit of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, section 2 sets out a range of functions that are and are deemed always to have been functions of the Minister.  Members will note that the range of functions outlined includes community development, voluntary activity and philanthropy, rural development and the co-ordination of the national drugs strategy.  Functions outlined also cover the Irish language, including the co-ordination of policy in this regard, the development of the Gaeltacht and the islands, and North-South co-operation within the ambit of these functions, including matters relating to Ulster Scots heritage, culture and language.  This provision is without prejudice to the generality of any other provision of the Bill or any other enactment conferring functions on the Minister.  In other words, the provision in the Bill does not affect any other existing statutory provisions in relation to the functions of the Minister.  In addition, section 2 of the Bill provides for powers to develop, implement, maintain, expand or terminate any scheme that, in the Minister's opinion, supports or promotes the functions set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">It should be noted that section 2 does not seek to limit or assume in any way the powers, functions and responsibilities of other Ministers or State agencies or bodies.  Accordingly, there is provision in the Bill for appropriate consultation with other Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Responsibility for rural development falls within the remit of my Department.  One of the bodies falling within the ambit of my Department is the Western Development Commission, WDC.  In line with the requirements of the Department of Finance regarding the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and the WDC, I have taken the opportunity in the Bill to provide in section 3 for the inclusion in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 of section 18 of the Western Development Commission Act 1998.  Essentially, the effect is that this provision which relates to a prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information can no longer be cited as grounds for refusing access to records sought under the Freedom of Information Acts.  This section of the Bill provides for greater transparency and will enable the public have access to Western Development Commission records previously unavailable to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Section 4 also relates to the Western Development Commission.  As the Deputies will be aware, the commission was established under the Western Development Commission Act 1998 to promote the economic and social development of the western region.  This Act requires that direct assistance provided by the commission shall be in the form of the purchase of shares in share capital and the provision of loans, but excluding grant aid.  The commission is unique among State agencies in that it provides such venture capital by means of its own investment vehicle, the western investment fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Section 8(5) of the Western Development Commission Act 1998 provides that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_601">Financial or other material aid provided to enterprises or projects by the Commission shall be in such form and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time (at such times as may be specified by the Minister) by the Commission with the consent of the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, and the amount thereof, in the case of any particular enterprise or project, shall not exceed £250,000 (€317,434) without the consent in writing of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The figure of £250,000 provided for in the 1998 legislation was set down at a time when fewer projects were being approved for funding by the Western Development Commission.  Given inflation and the increasing number of projects funded by the commission that now exceed the £250,000 value, I have decided in section 4 to provide for the raising to €1 million of the limit for financial or other material aid to enterprises or projects which the commission can provide without seeking the formal consent of the Minister.  It is my view that the proposed new limit will provide for a more efficient and streamlined project approval process.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I now propose to deal with sections 5, 6 and 7.  As I have previously stated, I am taking the opportunity in the Bill to make a number of technical amendments to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003.  Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the 2003 Act and will enable my Department to pay subsidies in respect of travel by island students to second level schools on the mainland which are outside the radius of 120km of the terminus currently provided for.  This will enable my Department to address issues that have arisen in respect of students on Inishbofin.  My Department had been subsidising, as part of the Inishbofin subsidised ferry service, a bus service on Sunday and Friday afternoons between Cleggan Pier and St. Jarlath's College, Tuam, which is within the aforementioned 120 km radius of Cleggan.  Within the past couple of years, however, St. Jarlath's College has ceased taking first year boarders, which means that students from Inishbofin now attend Garbally College, Ballinasloe.  This has created a difficulty in that Garbally College lies outside the 120 km radius of Cleggan, thus prohibiting payment of a subsidy in respect of the bus service to that location.  It would only be in exceptional circumstances such as this that my Department would be required to use the provision proposed in the Bill.  Any regulations made in respect of such cases would be made following consultation with the Minister for Education and Science and with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">In the Bill I am also providing for the amendment of section 3 of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Act 2003.  This amendment is provided for in section 6 and will clarify the Minister's remit in respect of specified functions relating to both existing and new aerodromes and ancillary facilities connected with the provision of air services between the islands and the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">My Department recently took legal advice on the use of the words "any such" in section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) in the 2003 Act and the advice was that this wording could be deemed to restrict the Minister to performing these functions solely in respect of existing aerodromes acquired in accordance with section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 2003 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Bill provides for the repeal of the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts from 1949 to 2002, following the transfer of the State shareholding in the former commercial State body Arramara Teoranta to Údaras na Gaeltachta with effect from 16 October 2006.  Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited was established in 1947 as a company limited by shares and changed its name to Arramara Teoranta by certificate in 1955.  The principal activity of the company is to produce seaweed meal for use in the alginate industry.  The State's involvement arose from the acquisition of shares in the company, as provided for in the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts, over a period from 1949 to 2002.  In 2006 the Government decided to transfer its shareholding in Arramara Teoranta which is located in the Connemara Gaeltacht at Cill Chiaráin to Údaras na Gaeltachta, the State body with responsibility for the overall economic development of the Gaeltacht.  It is within this context that the repeal of the Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Acts 1949 to 2002 is proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It is my view that the transfer of Arramara Teoranta to Údaras na Gaeltachta has been very positive for the body.  Arramara Teoranta's seaweed business is a good fit with Údaras na Gaeltachta's focus upon indigenous and natural resources in the Gaeltacht generally.  As a result of this action, Údaras na Gaeltachta now holds the entire shareholding of the company and its stewardship will offer scope for expansion of the existing business into more value-added products.  In the longer term this move will achieve optimum coherence regarding State investment in industry in the Gaeltacht, in addition togreater flexibility in regard to the development and future of Arramara.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">In addition to facilitating a number of amendments to existing legislation, the legislative proposals will provide a firm and more coherent statutory basis for the wide-ranging functions and responsibilities currently assigned to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I thank my colleagues, Deputies McGinley and O'Shea, for agreeing to take all Stages of this primarily technical Bill today and look forward to the debate on its provisions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_610">Déanaim chomhghairdeas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle ar a thoghadh ar an 30ú Dáil.  Tá súil agam go mbainfidh sé sult, taitneamh agus aoibhneas as a sheal sa Chathaoir údarásach sin ina bhfuil sé ina shuí i láthair na huaire.  Chomh maith leis sin, déanaim chomhghairdeas leis an Aire ar a athcheapadh i mbun na Roinne.  Tá buntáiste amháin le é a athcheapadh go bhfuil leanúnachas i bpolasaí na Roinne fad agus a bheas sé ansin.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Is Bille neamhurchóideach teicniúil é seo.  Tá sé de chuspóir aige ord agus eagar a chur ar dhualgais agus freagrachtaí éagsúla na Roinne.  De réir mar a thuigim, tháinig an moladh ón Ard-Aighne go dtabharfaí an Bille seo isteach agus go ndéanfaí é sin.  Mar sin, is féidir liom a rá ag an tosach nach mbeimid ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille agus go mbeimid ag tabhairt lán-tacaíochta agus comhoibriú dó.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">This technical, non-controversial Bill is intended to perform a tidying up exercise at the request of the Attorney General.  The legislation was initiated in the Seanad when most Deputies were otherwise engaged, although the Minister probably had to abandon important business in Galway West to attend proceedings in the Seanad.  I am not aware what would be constitutional position in the event that the legislation is passed by the new Dáil.  Must it go before the current Seanad or a newly constituted Upper House?  It may a straightforward matter.  Perhaps it will be sent directly to the President for signature if it is passed without amendment in the Dáil this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I accept the need to secure an integrated statutory basis for certain ministerial functions and I am grateful to the Minister and his officials for itemising the functions in question.  They include community development, voluntary activity and philanthropy, rural development, the national drugs strategy, teanga na Gaeilge, including the co-ordination of policy in this regard and the development of the Gaeltacht and the Islands, and North-South co-operation — Comhoibriú Thuaidh-Theas — including matters relating to Ulster-Scots heritage, culture and language, in which there is particular interest in parts of my constituency.  Appropriate consultation with other Ministers is provided for in the Bill.  These are worthy objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Section 3 provides for the inclusion in the Third Schedule in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 of section 18 of the Western Development Commission Act 1998.  The effect will be that this provision can no longer be cited as grounds for refusing access to records sought under freedom of information legislation.  The previous Government, of which the Minister was an important member, restricted access to information and any provision that makes it easier to obtain information from Departments of State or semi-State bodies is more than welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Section 4 provides for the raising to €1 million of the limit of financial or other material aid to enterprises or projects, which the Western Development Commission can provide without seeking the formal consent of the Minister.  Tuigim go bhfuil sé sin fíor cheana féin, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.  Bhí sé de cheart ag Údarás na Gaeltachta b'fhéidir IR£200,000 a thabhairt, agus tá sé sin imithe suas go dtí thar IR£1 milliún.  Má táimid ag déanamh an rud céanna le Coimisiún an Iarthair, tá sé loighciúil agus prataiciúil go ndéanfaí é sin.  Cuireann sé iontas orm gurbh é an teorainn a bhí ann go dtí seo ná IR£250,000.  Is dóiche go bhfuil sé in am againn aistriú ó phunt go dtí euro, fiú amháin chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le Coimisiún an Iarthair.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Section 5 enables the Minister to pay subsidies in respect of travel by island students.  Baineann sé seo go príomha leis an chás ar Oileán Inis Bó Finne ar chósta na Gaillimhe, ní Inis Bó Finne ar chósta Dhún na nGall.  Pupils from Inis Bó Finne do not travel to school on the mainland because they all live on the mainland.  I approve of the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Is it time to establish post-primary facilities on Inis Bó Finne.  Since I entered the House I have seen excellent developments in my constituency regarding provision of post-primary facilities.  I recall when former Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, approved a secondary school for Oileán Árainn Mhóir during the term of the coalition Government of 1983 to 1987.  Gairmscoil Mhic Diarmada on the island does excellent work.  It has won competitions and former pupils have graduated from various universities and travelled to different parts of the world.  I remember travelling to the island at the start of my career in the House more than 25 years ago.  On Sunday evenings every parent on the island would be at Leadhb Gharbh watching their offspring heading off to spend the week on the mainland.  It was a sad sight to behold.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Minister was probably partly responsible for approving an mheánscoil ar Oileán Thoraí, atá ag dul go maith.  I was on the island one Sunday two or three months before the election was called and it was clear that the islanders were proud that, for the first time in many years, young people from the island were graduating from university.  Tá múinteoir oilte ar Oileán Thoraí anois a fuair a cuid oideachais agus a bhí in ann teacht ar ais go dtí a hoileán féin le glacadh le cúram na scoile.  That is progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I do not know what is the position on Inis Bó Finne, although I am sure it has a bunscoil.  Perhaps the provision of subsidies to bring pupils from the island to Garbally Park since the closure of St. Jarlath's College is a good idea.  However, for the future of the island, its children, their parents and the family unit, we must consider providing a secondary level school on the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Section 6 clarifies the Minister's remit in respect of existing and new aerodromes and ancillary facilities.  While progress has been made on access to the islands, we are trying to secure airstrips on most islands.  At the risk of being parochial, I refer specifically to Oileán Thoraí, with its population of almost 200 souls, which has a primary and post-primary school.  Although it has a good ferry service, which I have often used, including a number of times in recent weeks, the island is ideally suited to having an airstrip.  I understand land has been identified, negotiations are taking place with the Land Registry and planning permission has already been granted by the local authority, but the situation is dragging on a bit.  During the course of the 29th Dáil, more questions were put down by myself and others with regard to the airstrip there than any airstrip on another island.  I hope that during the lifetime of this Dáil we will have a functioning airstrip on Oileán Thoraí.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The functions of Arramarra Teoranta have been given over to Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The danger is that we would fragment the industrial development agencies. Údarás na Gaeltachta is very well equipped and knows the situation with regard to the Gaeltacht and the islands.  Moreover, the handover of the functions of Arramarra has already happened — it is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  I agree with this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I am familiar with Arramarra, although it is now located in the Minister's constituency at Cill Chiaráin.  Previously, it had a long tradition at Dungloe in my constituency, where it provided employment to people living in coastal communities.  When it was transferred to Cill Chiaráin, an undertaking was given that Donegal seaweed farmers would be allowed to send their product to Cill Chiaráin, but we all knew this was a non-runner due to the cost of transport and so on, and that it was just a sop given at the time.  However, an industry survives in the Kilcar area which exports seaweed throughout the world for use as fertiliser on golf courses.  I am glad there were people with the imagination to fill that vacuum.  Perhaps half a dozen people work at that plant, which I visited a number of times recently.  At least something is happening as far as seaweed and natural product is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">One of the measures in the Bill refers to drugs.  We are all very concerned with what has happened in Cork in recent days.  Island people and seafaring people are very observant and have great experience.  If we are to tackle the drugs problem, we must harness the co-operation and interest of all.  Why should we not have a voluntary core of people, perhaps on the islands, who would be able to report any unusual activity to those who can deal with such activity?  We all need to get involved.  I am sure the island people would love to have a role to ensure nothing illegal is imported into the country.  If we can harness their interest, powers of observation and experience, it would give them a meaningful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">On some islands the population doubles or trebles during the summer months due to visitors to Irish colleges and so on.  It is a great pity there will not be a permanent Garda residence on the islands during those times.  There have been a number of incidents on islands in my constituency recently — one as recently as last weekend — where people had to be brought to hospital due to what happened late at night.  While gardaí visit the islands during the day, the Minister should use his influence to have a presence at night or perhaps a permanent presence during the summer.  The people of the islands are tax paying citizens and, therefore, are entitled to the protection of the State.  It is an issue of law and order.  While this may not be the Minister's area of responsibility, he is interested in the islands and wants the people there to have the best of what we have on the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Is Bille neamhurchóideach, teicniúil é seo agus tá áthas orm tacaíocht a thabhairt dó.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh Billí eile ag dul tríd le linn thréimhse na Dála nach mbeidh an comhoibriú céanna ann.  Ní thabharfaidh an Bille seo, áfach, an Rialtas anuas an uair seo.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_626">Déanaim chomhghairdeas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an onóra a bhronn an Teach seo air nuair a toghadh mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle é.  Tá mé cinnte go n-éireoidh go geal leis sa phost sin.  Tréaslaím leis an Aire faoi mar atá sé ina Aire sa Dáil arís agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis fosta.  Tá fadhbanna  idir lámha ag an Roinn agus caithfidh fuinneamh a bheith aige.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I thank the Minister for consulting Opposition spokespersons on the Bill in the course of the previous Dáil.  We know its content and I do not propose to discuss the detail of its main provisions.  We agree with the Minister.  The Labour Party will not oppose the Bill and has not put down amendments to it.  We accept the Bill for what it is, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, which states: "The purpose of the Bill is to confirm and to secure an integrated statutory basis for the broad range of functions and responsibilities of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs."  Nonetheless, I will make some observations on other issues that arise in the context of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The term "scheme" is one of the terms defined in section 1, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_629">"scheme"—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_630">(<i>a</i>) means programmes or measures operated, managed, delivered or sponsored, whether in whole or in part, directly or indirectly or in conjunction or co-operation with any other person (including the European Union or any Department of State), by the Department in relation to the performance of any of the functions of the Minister...</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I have a concern in this regard, namely, the elimination of duplication of schemes operated or provided by different Departments, although I accept an effort was made to deal with the issue during the lifetime of the last Government.  The other Departments that are most important to the schemes of the Minister's Department are the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister put much work into this matter during the term of the last Government.  Is he satisfied substantial progress has been made?  Is more to be accomplished on this front?  It is an issue that has given me some concern in the past.  Obviously, substantial progress in this regard would be welcomed on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I next turn to section 2 of the Bill, which concerns the functions of the Minister, including with regard to the Irish language.  The section states: "...support and promote the Irish language, including the coordination of policy in this regard".  What is meant by the co-ordination of policy?  Obviously, the function in regard to the Irish language is spread over virtually all Departments in one form or another, although the Department of Education and Science would certainly be a major player, as would the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the context of the funding provided for Irish language broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">There is no strategy for the Irish language although the Minister published a document last December.  I am concerned about this because proper co-ordination is achievable only in the context of a strategy with clearly stated and defined objectives.  What will the role of the Department, as described in the Bill, and that of the other Departments which have substantial responsibilities in respect of the Irish language, mean on a daily basis?  Better co-ordination offers scope for getting better results from the available resources.  Strategy is fundamental to that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Under the Bill the Minister has a responsibility to "co-ordinate the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy (including matters relating to the allocation of services and facilities to counter drug misuse in areas of the State where such misuse is significantly higher than in other areas of the State)."  I hope that this does not envisage an over-concentration of facilities in certain areas because the problem of misuse of drugs exists everywhere and is growing.  This was frequently aired during Question Time in the previous Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">What exactly does "co-ordination" mean in this context?  It is a weak term in respect of what is needed.  It does not mean that the Minister can direct other Departments or State agencies to do what he feels is necessary.  The Minister cannot nominate the priorities for other Departments and State agencies.  We are losing the battle on this issue although there is a Cabinet sub-committee dedicated to it, as is the case with the Irish language.  We need to step up the commitment to dealing with the problem.  The Department should have more power to get things done and to see that other Departments and State agencies do not drag their feet.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I would like to see more openness in the selection of projects for community development.  The patronage system that can develop over the lifetime of a Government that has been in office for ten years and looks like it will be there for another five can be detrimental to democracy.  There is a need for this Government not to do as it did with the Dormant Accounts Bill, which this Minister stewarded through the last Dáil and which ceased the allocation of these funds by the independent board, giving that power to the Government.  Does the Cabinet approve all the allocations or do certain Departments make allocations as they will?  The use of national lottery money during the last general election campaign shows that a patronage structure can develop whereby certain funds become slush funds during the lifetime of a Government that has been too long in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Is anything emerging from North-South co-operation on the revival of Ulster Scots or Scottish Gaelic in which we can rejoice?  We need clearly defined strategies for every aspect of the Irish language and its revival.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">That the Western Development Commission is coming under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act is welcome.  I spent a long time investigating this earlier today and it seems that more information will be available, which is progressive.  That is one of the reasons for our support for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The raising of the limit for financial or other material aid from £250,000 to €1 million is also welcome.  I compliment the Minister on this move because it was the right decision.  I recall his telling me that this concerns decentralisation and that some of the less momentous decisions can be taken away from the Department.  The Minister believes that there should be more delegation of this type.  In general, I welcome this legislation but there are issues relating to the Minister's functions on which I would like more clarity.  I would also like to know the working situation as it differs from what is in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_641">Os rud é nach bhfuil ach cúig nóiméad fágtha sa díospóireacht seo, ní bheidh deis agam déileáil le gach rud atá ardaithe ag na Teachtaí.  Déanfaidh mé iarracht labhairt mar gheall ar cuid acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I thank Deputies O'Shea and McGinley for their contributions and I will briefly deal with some of the issues they raised.  There are post-primary schools on Tory, Arranmore, Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr but there is none on Inishbofin, Inishturk, Clare Island or Cape Clear in Cork.  To my knowledge, they are not considered desirable by the communities on those islands because of the projected future numbers.  However, if it is not possible for there to be a school on an island we want to make sure children return home every weekend, which was not the case in olden days and was most unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">There are two other islands, Sherkin and Bear island, where children attend school every day and return home every day and that is a very satisfactory arrangement.  I agree with Deputy McGinley that the provision of the airstrip on Tory Island has been awaited for a considerable time and we have asked Donegal County Council to take out a compulsory purchase order in that regard.  The Bill will facilitate progress in this matter because it will mean we do not have to transfer the airstrip to the Minister prior to commencement of construction.  I hope, therefore, the Bill will help to progress the project because it is very dear to my heart.  More than all the islands in Ireland Tory still suffers from isolation, despite the improved ferry services.  We all agree that Oileán Thoraigh — an ceann is faide amach — is ea an oileáin is mó go bhfuil fadhb acu.  Tá ceisteanna mar gheall na gardaí ar na hoileáin tógtha agam cúpla uair.  Tá gardaí ar Inis Mór, ar ndóigh, ach taobh amuigh de sin tá fadhb ann.  Tá mé i i gcónaí ag brú go gcuirfear an dlí i bhfeidhm go hiomlán ar na hoileáin.  The islanders themselves are always looking for that and I concur with what the Deputy said on the subject of the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">In answer to another issue raised by Deputy McGinley, I understand that, if the Bill is passed today, it goes straight to Áras an Úachtaráin because it has already been taken in the Seanad and there are no amendments.  I am no expert on these matters but that is what I am advised.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Deputy O'Shea raised a number of issues.  We are proceeding with the cohesion process and hope to have it finalised in the coming month or two.  It will provide full coverage throughout the State for partnership and, in rural areas, will mean there is one company delivering the various programmes, whether they be the rural social scheme, the local development social inclusion programme, the LDSIP, or the Leader programme.  It will lead to a much better operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Deputy also asked about the role of the Irish language.  The Department used to co-ordinate policy relating to the language in an informal way.  For example, it co-ordinated ráiteas na Gaeilge, even though elements of it related to education, communication etc.  This Bill formalises its role and makes it absolutely clear the Department has the co-ordinating role in regard to Irish language policy.  We always said it would take two years to develop a detailed strategy for the Irish language, based on the ráiteas, agus tá sé i gceist dul ar aghaidh le sin.  Creidim go bhfuil sé fíor-tábhachtach go mbeidh straitéis láidir ann.  Tá thuas agus thíos i gceist ó thaobh cursaí Ghaeilge sa tír i gcoitinne.  Creidim nach féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh gan straitéis cuimsitheach.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">On the subject of the schemes, there is always a debate in this House in which Members ask why a Minister does or does not have certain powers.  In the exercise of the powers vested in me as Minister I have always tried to make sure good procedures are followed.  Accordingly, we have tightened up many schemes.  For example, the Ciste na Gaeilge is much more systemised now and it is clearer how it operates, as is the case with scéim bóithre áise and all the other schemes in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I have two firm objectives in mind.  One is ease of application and the other that people feel they get a fair decision and that everybody is treated equally.  We can create systems on paper that are very fair but so complicated to access that only those who have a degree in form-filling can get through them.  On the other hand one must have a system where the process is clear and the decisions fair.  A measure I look at very carefully is the number of written parliamentary questions on the subject of the schemes as they are an indicator of people's satisfaction.  Another is the number of people in any year who visit the Ombudsman with a complaint about administration in the Department.  It is a credit to the officials in my Department how few complaints are so referred.  I hope the schemes are as transparent, fair and equitable as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_664">This is a most important debate as this country faces a crisis in waste management.  Part of the Government policy to date has included the foisting of incinerators on communities around the country.  In County Louth, the county council vehemently opposed siting an incinerator in our community.  The then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, changed the law and planning permission is now in place for an incinerator.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">Tonight's motion deals with a proposed incinerator for Poolbeg.  It is clear from the motion that the electoral success of candidates in the Dublin area was linked to opposition to the Government's plans to build an incinerator at Poolbeg.  More than 300,000 voters in Dublin supported such candidates and the vast majority of Deputies elected for the Dublin region are opposed to this plan.  The elected members of Dublin City Council also oppose it.  There is no electoral mandate for this project and we call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to use his powers under the Waste Management Act to require this plan to be changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">One of the most important statements I read in researching this debate was made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_667">I make the strongest possible statement of my total opposition to this proposal.  It is my view, and the view of the Green Party, that this proposal will set back progress on sustainable waste management in Ireland by decades.  It will damage the health and amenity of local communities, and it will benefit only those private companies who are associated with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">This is the Minister's first test in office.  His first real challenge is to stand by the word he gave to the electorate to adhere to his party's policy on incineration and to explain to the House the price of his seat on the Government benches.  Is he copping out on his commitment?  Will he oppose the installation of the incinerator in Poolbeg and at the other proposed sites around the country, as local communities expect?</p>
            <p eId="para_669">In the amendment the Minister has tabled to the motion, it is clear he is signing off his policy to the Fianna Fáil Party and the only thing he has brought to the table of Government is the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  There is no fundamental change in what is before the House now and was the subject of a Private Members' motion that was debated here some months ago.  At that time the Minister proposed a Private Member's Bill to oppose the incinerator at Poolbeg.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The facts speak for themselves and the truth will come out.  How many incinerators has the Minister sold out on?  How many incinerators has he agreed will be built as part of his deal with the Government?  Is it one, two, three or four?  Will the one at Carnstown in County Meath go ahead?  I challenge the Minister to reveal to the House his plans in this regard.  I accept the proposed incinerator in Cork may be <i>sub judice</i>, but what about the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg?  What is the price of the seat the Minister currently occupies?  Where is his determination?  Where is the fire in his belly to stand up to Fianna Fáil and tell it, as his party’s policy states and as people believe, that he is opposed to incineration and that he will fight tooth and nail against an incinerator in Poolbeg?  That is what all his constituents want him to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">I have campaigned in County Louth against the incinerator it is proposed to build beside my home.  I work closely with members of the Green Party in trying to achieve that aim.  Unless the Minister stamps his authority on this issue and delivers to his constituents in the way he campaigned so forcefully in the past, his term in Government will be a washout and a cop-out.  It is a strange state of affairs when the first statement from the "green" Minister with responsibility for energy is about nuclear power and a debate on same rather than debating alternative energy and cutting back on wastage of fossil fuels.  It is clear the Green Party's deal in Government has included selling Poolbeg down the river.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Following his recent trip to Europe the Minister stated he had secured a change in policy to the effect that incineration is considered as disposal rather than waste to energy.  I support this and acknowledge the progress made by the Minister.  The motion states the Government has no mandate to proceed with the incinerator at Poolbeg.  In June 2006 the Minister tabled a motion in this House stating that his predecessor, Deputy Roche, should use his powers under section 24(<i>c</i>) of the Waste Management Act 1996 to require local authorities in County Dublin to vary the replacement waste management plan for the Dublin region.  What exactly has changed, what miraculous thing has happened to make this call unworthy of his support?  What does the Minister intend to do about this matter?  People are waiting for him to take action.  He should use the power of his office to fight the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg and ensure it does not proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Creighton, who tonight keeps her promise to the people of Dublin South-East by continuing her strong campaign to prevent this unnecessary monstrosity being foisted upon them.  I suspect if the voters in the constituency knew that Deputy Gormley was about to sell out so spectacularly, he might have limped home behind, rather than just a whisker in front of, the former Deputy, Mr. McDowell.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">If one builds an incinerator, it is necessary to feed it.  While incineration has worked in Europe, it has worked in tandem with recycling rates of over 40% and 50%.  I do not believe we will ever reach such rates of recycling if we build incinerators in this country before the recycling, reuse and repair technology is in place.  In County Louth we got our first recycling centre approximately three years after planning permission was granted for the incinerator.  We are using the wrong approach.  We want to know what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will do about this issue.  The famous phrase, "Where's the beef?" was used in America to comment on a presidential election there.</p>

            <p eId="para_676">It might even be a genetically modified veggie burger.  Where does the Minister stand on this matter?  To where has his 25 years in political life led him?  He has reached a powerful position and he can act and show his true green colours and not raise the white flag, which is what he has done in his amendment.  How many incinerators has he sold out on?  Is it three or four?  The Minister was rightly prominent in his party's negotiations on a programme for Government.  Perhaps he will tell us how many incinerators it has been agreed to put in place.  That is critical to the credibility of his party and his personal credibility as a politician.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">The main reason for opposition to incineration is the impact on health.  What new regulations will the Minister insist are put in place, especially given that the environmental impact assessment does not include a health impact assessment?  Critical to any future legislative change must be, fundamentally, an assessment of the impact on health.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
            <p eId="para_678">It gives me pleasure to speak on this issue that is critical for both my constituency and the country, namely, waste management and specifically the proposed incinerator for the Poolbeg Peninsula.  This evening the Opposition is offering the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, the opportunity to stop the Poolbeg incinerator.  He need only support the Fine Gael motion by voting with those parties in the House which oppose incineration.  It is as simple as that.  It should be easy for a Green Party Minister to vote against the unnecessary burning of 600,000 tonnes of waste per annum.  This constitutes waste that can otherwise be disposed of in clean and safe ways.  It should be easy and natural for a Green Party Minister to support such a motion and I hope the Minister agrees with me when the time comes to vote on the motion tomorrow evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The proposed incinerator facility is to be one of the largest in Europe.  It will be a mass burn incinerator, the scale of which means that it will require increasing quantities of waste to remain commercially viable.  In other words, the proposed incinerator will not be a facility of last resort, as it ought to be, to deal with waste that cannot be disposed of by other means.  On the contrary, it will become a massive waste burning monster that will provide a disincentive to reduce and recycle waste.  In simple terms, it will become an alternative to environmentally friendly waste management options.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">A total of 2,000 residents in my constituency of Dublin South-East, myself included, lodged objections with An Bord Pleanála to the proposed incinerator.  While the voice of the people should count for something in a democracy, it appears the Minister disagrees.  On agreeing a programme for Government in recent weeks, he had the opportunity to make the incinerator in Poolbeg a make or break issue.  Unfortunately, however, he failed to so do.  On the contrary, there is no reference to the incinerator in the programme for Government.  How quickly power hungry Ministers forget the concerned residents who voted them into office in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">The Minister's silence on this issue in recent weeks since becoming a Cabinet member is deafening.  Although he is in the Green Party's dream Ministry with all its attendant powers, he has failed to set out his stall.  He shied away from this issue when he negotiated the programme for Government, which was probably the best opportunity to stop the incinerator he was likely to have in the Government's lifetime.  Since then, he has sheepishly avoided the issue.  Can the prospect of power have caused him to sell out on the single issue that matters deeply to the constituents of Dublin South-East?  I hope Members will find out tomorrow when the division on this motion takes place.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">Fine Gael's position on this issue is clear.  It has opposed the Poolbeg incinerator consistently.  It is the wrong policy and the wrong solution to a dire waste management issue.  It is the wrong facility at the wrong location at the wrong time.  Those who are genuinely opposed to the imposition of an incinerator in Poolbeg will support Fine Gael's motion during this debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">It does not take a rocket scientist to work out the health dangers and implications that pertain to incineration.  All Members are familiar with the health issue and aware that children and the elderly are particularly at risk.  The World Health Organisation has issued clear studies of the impact of dioxins and their link to the risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, etc.  In 2003 a study published in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>showed that living near an incinerator increased the risks of a baby being born with spina bifida or congenital heart defects by 17% and 12%, respectively.  The Health Research Board report commissioned by the Government states: “[a]t present, Ireland has insufficient resources to carry out adequate risk assessments for proposed waste management facilities ... Irish health information systems cannot support routine monitoring of the health of people living near waste sites”.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">As for the environment and ecology, it is clear that the proposed Poolbeg incinerator is close to natural resources that are valued highly by Dublin's citizens and those of the south east, in particular.  I refer to Sandymount Strand and Irishtown naturepark.  It is beside a special protection area and a special area of conservation in Dublin Bay.  The River Liffey risks being endangered from the emission of biocides from the plant and the existing threat to salmon stocks will increase.  Moreover, it is clear there will be an impact on the climate through CO2 emissions which will take place in the face of Ireland's failure to fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">The location of the incinerator is wrong.  While it has been argued that it will be located well away from the densely populated areas of Dublin South-East, this is untrue.  It will be located in the immediate vicinity of parts of my constituency, including Sandymount, Irishtown and Ringsend.  The nature of this residential area has changed dramatically with the granting of planning permission for further development on the Poolbeg Peninsula.  Moreover, more planning permission is likely to be granted as planners flout and ignore the wishes of councillors in the local government system.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">As for the visual impact of the proposed incinerator in one of the most precious and beautiful parts of Dublin city, it will be as big as Croke Park and almost as tall as Liberty Hall.  Do Members really wish to see such a development beside an area of conservation?  In respect of the impact on traffic, the area is log-jammed; access routes are limited and few proposals have been made to improve them.  The proposal for an eastern bypass has fallen by the wayside.  The catchment area of Dublin South-East is bound to be affected by this development.  On Dublin City Council I fought to extend the cordon for HGVs around the area to prevent them from trundling up and down Beach Road and Strand Road.  Were this incinerator project to proceed, those arterial routes would lead to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">The Minister is familiar with the policy arguments in this regard.  The Dublin city development plan has a stated objective, on the part of the planners, to which no councillor on Dublin City Council agreed.  In the process of amending and creating a new development plan for the city two and a half years ago councillors created a new zoning that excluded thermal treatment, the euphemistic term for incineration.  However, this is being ignored by the Government in its promotion of its incineration policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">There are many alternatives to incineration and I am sorry to state that when the Green Party was in opposition, it was the party which propounded many of them.  I agreed with it at the time and it is a shame that it appears to have performed a U-turn on so many of them.  Fine Gael has set out to achieve a goal of zero waste, the correct objective when dealing with waste management.  Recycling facilities must be rolled out nationwide, while waste separation laws to prohibit the disposal of mixed wet and dry waste should be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The Minister's powers should be used.  He should have the courage and conviction to so do during his tenure of his elevated post.  He has the opportunity to bring forward regulations under the Waste Management Act 1996 to give effect to obligations on producers which I hope will happen to promote reusable, recyclable and biodegradable products.  He also has the power to establish regulations to require producers and distributors to operate deposit refund schemes.  Such schemes operate in most European countries but still not in Ireland.  Moreover, the Minister should repeal sections 4 and 5 of the Waste Management Act to provide that the making of a waste management plan should become a reserved function of democratically elected councillors.  This should happen and I hope it will.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The motion presents the Minister with an enormous opportunity.  Less than eight weeks ago the Green Party was ardently demanding the complete abolition of the incinerator project.  Now, however, it appears it has claimed that a watered down, somewhat neutered approach to the issue of incineration will suffice.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">The Minister claims that by an agreement not to raise landfill fees "in such a way as to give competitive advantage to incineration", the incinerator will be stopped.  Pull the other one.  Either the Minister is naive or this is a blatant attempt to hoodwink us into believing the Green Party will do something about incineration.  We will not be fooled by these tactics.  We have our own solution, which will result in the incinerator in Poolbeg being scrapped.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">The matter is in the Minister's hands through section 24(<i>c</i>) of the Waste Management Act 1996.  The Minister stood on this side of the House and challenged the former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, to exert pressure on the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to use those powers to stop the incinerator going ahead by requiring the managers of the four Dublin local authorities to vary the waste management plan in the Dublin region and to exclude the siting of the incinerator at Poolbeg.  The current Minister asked for this action to take place, but the opportunity is now his because he has the power.  Will he accept his responsibilities?  The Minister must support our motion, the reasons for which are clear.  Today’s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> quotes a Green Party spokesman alleging that the Minister could not interfere in the planning process.  Why then did the Minister urge the former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do just that?  Was the Minister lying or did he believe in what he was asking?  Alleging the former Minister had the power to intervene would suggest that the current Minister now has the power to intervene.  Was the Minister correct, as I believe he was, last year in saying Mr. McDowell had such powers under section 24(<i>c</i>)?</p>
            <p eId="para_694">I hope the Minister would not be happy to do a complete U-turn on the incinerator proposal, that the waft of leathery upholstery in his new Mercedes has not gone to his head——</p>

            <p eId="para_708">We must deal with waste, but there are sectors of waste with which we are not dealing at all.  For example, bio-degradable waste is not being considered, which is a significant problem at landfills in terms of leechate and methane gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">I was shocked to hear of a gaping hole in the EIS, namely, that it did not account for health risks.  I am speaking as a commercial dairy farmer, of which there are few remaining.  We have long been lectured by the Green Party on the potential risks of GM foods.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, was one of those lecturers.  The concern regarding GM foods is chemical-resistant weeds, known as superweeds.  The Minister's constituency is going to get the largest superweed in the history of the State in the form of the incinerator.  That it will be the size of Croke Park is crazy.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">On the Green Party's road to Damascus-style conversion or U-turn, the Minister does not believe that this is the right way to go.  He did not believe it eight weeks ago.  He must do whatever is politically expedient.  To quote Groucho Marx, "Those are my principles, and if you don't like them, well, I've got others."  Unfortunately, this seems to be the case here.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">The site selection process bothers me greatly.  Speaking as a rural Deputy from a rural county, if someone sought planning permission in an SAC or special protection area, the environmental section of the planning department would come down on him or her, as would the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, State agencies and other groups and organisations.  In no way would he or she get permission, but here comes something the size of Croke Park that is being brought through the planning process like a baby.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The matter is being reviewed by the petitions committee of the European Parliament and some MEPs have been to Ireland to discuss it in recent days.  The removal of local democracy has also been discussed.  It is of concern that we are removing the democratically elected members of local authorities for the issue.  We will destroy the niche market.  Ireland produces the best foodstuffs anywhere in the world.  We produce it from grass and the cereal products we feed to livestock.  It can be marketed well, but we will sell out the niche market and the organic production market that is just starting up.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has spoken passionately in this respect.</p>

There are other plans to build an incinerator at Carranstown, outside Duleek in County Meath.

            <p eId="para_724">I am genuine in what I say.  The Fianna Fáil machine worked.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State will protect Meath's farmers by taking the route of having no incinerator there or in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">Like at Ringsend, the raw material for the Meath incinerator site will entail a massive transport operation to and from the site.  Located close to the M1, the incinerator will attract heavy goods vehicles from across the north east, probably from the Dublin region and possibly from Northern Ireland.  The existing road network of the north east, particularly in Meath, is not capable of coping with the amount of waste brought by road to and from the incinerator.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">The incinerator will be built on an aquifer.  The supply of water to service current and future development needs is a significant issue in parts of Meath East.  Any possible threats to water supplies posed by a proposed incinerator must weigh heavily when considering that development and its capacity.  This issue demands consideration, given the significant population growth envisaged for Drogheda and its environs of Duleek, Dunore, Stamullen and the east coast towns of Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington, Donacarney and Julianstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">Significant cultural changes have been achieved in recent years, including the smoking ban, control on the use of plastic bags and the elimination of smog from dirty coal.  The same could be achieved with a national recycling campaign.  To date, however, the Government and its agencies have not been serious about recycling.  A minimum of €100 million will be spent on this incinerator.  It is not difficult to imagine what could be achieved if that amount were put into a clear and focused national recycling campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Before entering Government, the Green Party was totally opposed to the incinerator plans for Ringsend.  Its general election candidate in Louth, Mary Deary, and Councillor Tom Kelly from Meath, whom I know well, are on record in their opposition to the incinerator outside Duleek.  What is the party's position now that it is in Government?  Incinerators are a potential timebomb.  We do not know the long-term health implications they may have.  It seems the Government is content to play Russian roulette with the health and well-being of the people of south-east Dublin and Meath.  We are of the view, however, that we do not need these incinerators in Ringsend, Meath or anywhere else.  My great concern is that the incinerator site in Meath will be turned into a national facility for waste.  This will be the reality if the incinerator project in Ringsend does not go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">There is a general recognition that we must turn to other activities to maintain the boom of recent years.  I have no doubt we will return to agriculture, in view of the quantities of food we are importing and the inadequate quantities of food being produced across Europe.  I hope Ireland will follow the example of New Zealand and forget about incineration.  That country took the route of mass production and many Irish farmers went there and attained the satisfaction of being able to produce food.  I defended the Minister, Deputy Gormley, as a farmer's man, and I expect him to defend the farmers of Ireland by ensuring there is no incineration in Meath, Ringsend or elsewhere in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">I have heard him speak in this Chamber many times about how incineration would discourage recycling and be a source of possibly harmful emissions.  The Green Party previously refused even to accept the role of incineration as set out in the EU hierarchy.  Nor did it accept the notion that there is any energy saving in terms of the waste to energy function of incineration.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">Whatever about past utterances, what I am interested in now is action.  The Minister must make a decision on this and we ask him to do so according to what we propose in our motion.  There cannot be drift, postponement and claims that this is a matter for local authorities.  We are all carrying major costs in terms of waste disposal.  This is particularly so in the case of the business community, which seeks clarity and certainty on this issue.  If incineration is not employed, there must be information in terms of the what, when and where of other methods.  These matters must be decided quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">I have limited time in which to speak on this multidimensional issue, so I will concentrate on two particular aspects.  The first relates to the location of the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg.  All traffic into Poolbeg must travel via the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel.  This is true even of waste collected in Ringsend itself because it must first be sent for baling.  The only two baling stations in Dublin are on the south of the city, at Ballyogan and Ballymount.  Some 80% of all local authority waste will be baled in one of those locations.  This baled waste will then have to be delivered to Poolbeg via the M50 and the port tunnel.  This is madness both logistically and environmentally.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">Since the ban on five-axle vehicles in the city centre, Ringsend is probably the most inaccessible location in which to place an incinerator that will be serviced by heavy-duty freighters.  It was originally selected in the context of a proposed eastern bypass of the M50 that would allow waste to be delivered from both directions.  The current situation, however, is that it can only be delivered from one direction.  There is no eastern bypass and it is my understanding that the Green Party is not in favour of such an bypass. Unless that infrastructure is delivered in tandem with an incinerator, there could hardly be a less suitable location from a traffic perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">For that reason alone, the site must be revisited, just as the port tunnel route should have been revisited when the proposed eastern bypass was dropped.  Instead we have an infrastructural white elephant that will always be underutilised.  With 80% of rubbish originating in the two baling stations on the south of the city and access to the incinerator only possible from the north side, it will be a nightmare to transport the same rubbish first south, then north and back south again via the M50.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">The second issue is even more problematic and must also be addressed immediately.  This is the security of supply of waste, not only to incinerators but to all our waste infrastructure, whether in Ringsend or elsewhere, since the introduction of higher standards of disposal and recycling.  Charges to the consumer have become the norm, which is necessary to comply with the polluter pays principle.  This has attracted the private sector in competition with the local authorities to collect, process and dispose of waste.  These private companies also offer recyclables for sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">Competition is good for the consumer so long as it is effective.  However, an unintended result of the competition in waste management is that the public facilities that were used heretofore by local authorities to collect, process, bale and transport waste to landfill, as provided for out of the public purse, are no longer being utilised by the private sector.  We now have extra capacity in publicly provided facilities in Dublin.  Large private sector waste disposal companies, such as Greenstar, are collecting both waste and green bins in competition with the public sector and are making their own arrangements to dispose of that waste.  This is perfectly legal but it does not represent effective utilisation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The Minister must bring certainty to the issue of who has control over waste.  Before spending money on any more public facilities, whether through public private partnership or direct public provision, there must be clarity as to the control of waste and who is responsible for its disposal.  It is a waste of public funds to provide any facility for which there is no demand.  This is not confined to incineration but is something that applies to all waste infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">I thank Deputy O'Dowd for putting forward a motion on this important issue.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  I was concerned last week when we were debating the plans for co-located hospitals that the Green Party Members had forgotten the location of the Parliament.  I am glad to see they have rediscovered it at least on this issue.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on his new role.  Notwithstanding the comments I will be obliged to make later, I have greats hopes for him as Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">My constituency of Dublin West is being ravaged by poor planning and the indifference of a series of Fianna Fáil Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The resulting problems include unsustainable development and massive sprawl, both exacerbated by car dependency.  We have seen the development of housing without any associated facilities, including schools, open spaces, parks and playgrounds.  Public open space is held back for years by developers, while housing developments go unfinished.  Cases regarding half-built apartment blocks can take years to resolve.  There is a ridiculous situation in terms of enforcement and planning retention whereby people can build whatever they like and simply apply for retention.  In addition, there is a cumbersome taking in charge process and an unregulated property management sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">I hope the Minister's appointment represents a clean break from Fianna Fáil policies.  He is in the tent now.  It remains to be seen whether that is the tent of Government or merely the Galway races tent.  I warn the Minister that we expect results on these issues.  If he fails, either through his own weaknesses or because he is unable to overcome his coalition colleagues, he should be warned that we are here and willing to replace him.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">I would like to introduce the House to the Ghost of Deputy Gormley Past in order to remind him of some of the comments he has made on this issue.  Last February he stated the planning case against the incinerator was unanswerable, the site selection process flawed, the traffic impact disastrous and, most importantly, that there was no need for this massive facility.  He noted that there had been instances where An Bord Pleanála inspectors had recommended against projects on planning grounds, only to have the recommendation overturned by the board on the basis of Government policy.  Is that still Government policy?  In April he told the Taoiseach that Green Party policy was different, with a zero waste strategy which did not allow incineration.  Now that he is Minister, is that Government policy?</p>
            <p eId="para_745">Referring to Deputy Chris Andrews, the Minister stated: "These candidates have done absolutely nothing to reverse the Government policy which has landed the people of Dublin South-East with the proposed incinerator, but they will take the opportunity afforded by the oral hearing to paint themselves as the project's greatest opponents."  Does he now fall into that category?  Did he just use the hearing as an opportunity to practise the glib and oily art of speaking and purposing not or was his contribution genuine?</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I remind the Minister of his campaign launch on 1 March, entitled: "Get Fianna Fáil and the PDs out", when he stated: "Bertie Ahern can't quite decide whether he's St. Paul or St. Augustine.  Last year we had his Pauline conversion to socialism, but when it comes to the environment it's a case of ‘make me green, but not yet Lord'."  I do not think the Taoiseach has ever undergone any conversions.  The question we ask tonight is whether the Minister has undergone a conversion.  Does he remain the campaigner and politician of principle he used to be or has he been assimilated and subsumed into Fianna Fáil?  The answer will come tomorrow night at 8.30 p.m. when he casts his vote on the motion.</p>

I live with my family in Ringsend and my position as a public representative for Dublin South-East and a local resident in regard to the Poolbeg incinerator project is well known, entirely consistent and second to none.  However, I address the House as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and in that capacity must act under and be respectful of restrictions placed on me by primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party cites one of the statutory provisions under which I operate but conveniently ignores another.  Notwithstanding the power available to me under section 24(<i>c</i>) of the Waste Management Act, there is also a very clear limitation of my powers under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which states: “the Minister shall not exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned”.  In the light of this provision it would not be appropriate for me to comment on or interfere with this case which is before An Bord Pleanála.  The Opposition knows this.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">I have set out for Deputies the exact legal position.  The Poolbeg project is the subject of an application by Dublin City Council to An Bord Pleanála for planning permission and an oral hearing in that regard has recently concluded.  It is also the subject of an application by the council to the EPA for a waste licence and the legislation governing this process has a similar provision.  These restrictions on ministerial involvement were put in place by the Oireachtas for good reasons.  Many of us are old enough to remember the controversies which surrounded past political involvement in the planning process.  An Bord Pleanála and the EPA exist in the independent statutory form they enjoy in order that the public can be assured decisions in respect of physical planning and environmental licensing are made independently of the Government.  It is easy to suggest an <i>à la carte</i> approach, according to which interventions that are benign or well meaning are all right but others are not.  In the real world of due process such an approach is a nonsense.  These bodies are either independent or they are not.  While we as individuals may not always agree with decisions made by independent regulators — it would be remarkable if we did — we nonetheless can see that the balance of public interest rests in their independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">While I cannot comment further on the future of the Poolbeg project, I would like clarify my Department's involvement.  I do so to demonstrate the limited nature of that involvement and the considerable legal autonomy which attaches to the existing statutory regional waste planning system.  The facility is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan——</p>

            <p eId="para_763">——for which the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts.  As the procurement has been by way of a public private partnership, the role of my Department has been to certify that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy.  The Department in a letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council which acts as lead authority for the project that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process, there was no objection to the council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner.  In the normal course this would have quickly ensued.  However, due to a corporate restructuring on the side of the selected private partner, I am advised that it was not until 14 May 2007 that the project board which is chaired by Dublin City Council and supervises the project was in a position to sign off on the contractual arrangements in line with the process concluded in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">The regulatory authorities will ultimately adjudicate on this project.  That is their preserve.  It is the duty of Government to set the legal and policy framework within which the public and private sectors can deliver an economically and ecologically efficient system of waste management.  The Government's programme sets out how this can be better achieved.  We do not start from scratch.  I acknowledge that much has already been achieved in bringing our waste management infrastructure and services into the 21st century.  I commend those local authorities which have led the way and, in particular, the tens of thousands who routinely take responsibility for the waste they generate.  Leaving out the green bin or visiting the local bottle bank or recycling facility is now a matter of course for large numbers.  There is no lack of willingness on the part of the public if they are provided with the means to properly deal with their waste.  The introduction of pay-by-use charging systems has also provided an incentive for people to act responsibly.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">There is already a significant commitment to developing a world class approach to waste management on the basis of the internationally accepted waste hierarchy.  It is not to devalue these efforts to assert that the challenges we face demand even more of us.  The programme for Government rededicates us to this goal.  The EPA has already done some work in improving our ability to prevent waste arising in the first place.  This effort must intensify.  Waste prevention is at the top of the waste hierarchy and considerable changes are needed at all levels of society and in all sectors to achieve our goals for preventing and minimising waste.  Similarly, in the area of recycling we must move much more rapidly in developing markets for recyclables.  The EPA-led market development group will play a key role in that regard.  This will be particularly important in a context in which we are making further significant progress in driving up our recycling rates.  Simple measures such as more bottle banks and extending opening hours of recycling centres will play a role in this continuing improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">We have seen progress in developing producer responsibility initiatives.  Ireland has been a leader in implementing the WEEE directive.  We also have put in place initiatives dealing with farm plastics and end-of-life vehicles.  I want to see greater engagement with the productive sector.  One of the reasons behind the polluter pays principle is the need to ensure producer responsibility operates as an effective incentive for reducing waste generation and ensuring the reusability and recyclability of waste.  We need to do much more to minimise the waste we have to deal with and the resultant demand for recovery and disposal infrastructure.  In other words, we need a much greater focus on the upper tiers of the waste hierarchy where both the challenge and the environmental pay-off are greatest.  It is easy to bury or burn and disposal technologies will continue to be necessary for some time but they must be seen as methods of last resort and their importance should diminish as we better develop our approaches to waste minimisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">There is evidence that we are potentially capable of much greater.  Already the EPA data show that we have achieved our national recycling target of 35% set for the year 2013.  This is up from 9% in 1998 and eight years ahead of what was regarded as a very ambitious target, but maybe we need to increase the extent of our ambition.  On the recycling of packaging waste, we also have a good story to tell, having already reached 60% of the EU target set for 2011, but even here we can do much better.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">I acknowledge these achievements and the work of those whose efforts made them possible but I am determined to go further towards being a world leader in the drive for a recycling society.  Ireland has led the way in tackling the scourge of plastic bags and environmental pollution from smoking. and we can do so again in the way we manage our waste.  One could argue that we are limited only by the limit of our ambition.  In the context of the commitments in the programme for Government I want to drive that ambition.  I would prefer to see us falling short of world class ambitions than comfortably meeting less demanding ones.  This should not be about scoring political points with soft achievements but about showing real leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Progress on recycling has been greatly assisted by my Department's scheme of capital grants in support of local authority recycling facilities.  A sum of €100 million has been allocated since 2002.  In the context of the provisions in the national development plan I am determined to maintain this effort.  I shall also further roll out, in the years immediately ahead, the recently established programme of financial assistance to local authorities to help remediate certain of the historic landfills which are a relic of the way we once dealt with our waste.</p>

            <p eId="para_780">I do not underestimate the difficulties involved but I am determined to create a new context in which the challenges I have mentioned can be met and our achievements built on.  In this regard the Government is committed to carrying out a review of the regional waste management plans.  This will be respectful of the statutory position of the local authorities and of the reviews of the existing plans which they have concluded.  However, I want to bring fresh thinking to bear to better inform the waste management planning process.  I want us to think outside the box in looking at the full range of technological and behavioural solutions which are potentially available to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">In particular I believe that there has been too much emphasis on incineration to the exclusion of other technologies.  The Government programme has identified mechanical and biological treatment solutions as having a real potential to help us more sustainably manage the waste we cannot prevent, reuse or recycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">There has, perhaps, been a tendency to advance stock solutions in circumstances where a more creative approach could ultimately lead us to a better outcome.  Ireland is well advanced in terms of segregating our waste at source.  The green bin service is already being supplemented in some areas by a brown bin service for compostable waste.  While I may have certain concerns regarding the approach to waste management taken in Dublin and elsewhere, I commend the approach being taken by a number of local authorities in piloting the segregation of biological waste.  In Dublin, my Department will co-fund two significant biological treatment facilities which will allow for the roll-out of brown bin services.  Funding is also being provided for the regional materials recovery facility.  This demonstrates what can be done in combining source segregated collection services with the infrastructure to properly process the waste collected.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">I shall examine the responses to the recent public consultation on the future regulation of the waste management sector.  I appreciate the contribution which local authorities and the private sector are making in the area of waste management but I am concerned that waste management services should be structured in such a way as to meet our overall environmental and social objectives.  I shall identify the legislative or policy initiatives that may be appropriate to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">I am determined to significantly advance our national capacity to manage our waste in the most environmentally sustainable way that is economically feasible.  In this context, the review of the existing waste management plans will prove very valuable in orienting local authorities towards optimal solutions both in terms of the technologies which they promote and the targets they set.</p>

Now, nobody, except the extremely deluded, questions the science behind climate change.  I do not think anybody, including Fine Gael, would disagree with me on that, although at the weekend I did hear Deputy Michael Ring question the need for carbon levies.

            <p eId="para_859">I welcome the Minister's commitment to a major change in Ireland's waste policies.  Some achievements have been made by previous Governments but they do not go far enough.  The Green Party's goal — and I am glad to hear Fine Gael repeating it here — is for a zero waste society.  It is still a long-term target, but with this new Minister we are now moving in the right direction.  The international review of waste management in Ireland will lay out the road map for the necessary changes.  We have a long way to go.  We have seen the success of recycling facilities introduced by local authorities over recent years.  When Green Party councillors, including Deputy Gormley, were proposing the door-to-door collection of waste for recycling during the 1990s, they were ridiculed by their colleagues from other parties, including Fine Gael I am sorry to say.  Now, the kerbside collection of recyclables is something people in many Irish towns look on as their right, as part of the normal running of a civilised society.  Those, and they are still many, who do not yet have recycling collections are rightly annoyed at being left with a second-class service.  No one doubts that it is the right thing to do, but it is time to go further than recycling; we need to prevent and minimise waste.  The best instance of this so far in Ireland is the plastic bag tax, which has been widely heralded internationally.  I am not sure if Deputy O'Dowd realises it, but I proposed that tax back in 1994 when Fine Gael and Labour were in power.  Unfortunately, however, it was actually a Fianna Fáil-led Government that implemented the tax.  That is the record from Fine Gael's point of view.  As that party knows, the long-term guiding principle behind the Green Party's waste policy is the objective of zero waste.  It is not an instant solution, but a long-term strategy for achieving long-term sustainability.  The implementation of zero waste resource management systems are arguably amongst the most important steps needed to ensure our transition to a sustainable society, to prevent further environmental deterioration and damage to the earth's atmosphere and ecosystems.  Zero waste confronts the whole idea of endless material consumption by assisting those who are locked into the system to challenge, in a positive way, their own behavioural patterns.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">Within the zero waste model the community must maximize reuse, repair, recycling and composting.  Industry, for its part, must redesign objects the community cannot reuse, repair, recycle or compost.  Both industry and the community need to reduce wasteful practices like over-packaging and over-consumption.  Government has to provide leadership and the appropriate fiscal and financial systems which reward waste elimination, reuse, repair, recycling and composting, while penalising the creation of unnecessary or difficult wastes.  I hope Deputy Ring will take that on board.  The potential rewards from the implementation of a zero waste model will include saving raw material resources, creation of employment, retention of wealth within local communities and within the country, and a reduction in the need for new landfill sites or the building of incinerators.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">I took it upon myself to visit an area that was implementing the zero waste strategy, without incineration obviously, as incineration would be an impediment to a zero waste strategy.</p>

There is no grey bin and that should be our objective.  I hope we can all come together at local authority level to implement it.  That is the way to achieve zero waste.  This critical shift would signal an end to the unsustainable approaches to waste management that we pursue at present.  It will significantly reduce the environmental damage that our waste practices have caused to the environment and will enhance our ability to live in a low impact and responsible way in this country and on the earth generally.  The Green Party is committed, in Government, to providing the political leadership to allow this to happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">I never thought I would see the Minister reduced to such capitulation so soon.  I never believed that the passion that animated his 25 years in public life would be so run over in such a short time by the mandarins of the Custom House.  All the bluster and flak from his acting leader will not provide the mudguard or bioguard for his craven submission to what is happening.  I respect the legal cover that has been given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, in his speech and I recognise the mission of any good civil servant is to protect the Minister and the Department.  I have benefitted from this in my time but there are times when one must think outside the box.  Deputy Gormley must ask himself, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, whether the policy direction to An Bord Pleanála to provide for incineration still stands or can be retrieved.  One cannot simply say there is a statutory legal planning process that cannot be interfered with.  When the planning inspector in Ringaskiddy recommended that an incinerator there should not go ahead An Bord Pleanála, having regard to the policy direction that was legally given to it by the then Minister acting in his official capacity, said there was a higher instruction.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">This issue will not go away and the Minister, Deputy Creighton and I all share a proximity to the voters of the area.  They will find the Minister's explanation tonight unbelievable.  Forget about Tara and the Minister's declaration of impotence on the matter due to Deputy Dick Roche signing the order as he exited office.  Has the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, asked that the policy direction given to An Bord Pleanála be reviewed?  If he has not the probable strong recommendation of the planning inspector against the proposed incinerator at Poolbeg will be waved aside because of the policy direction that is seen by An Bord Pleanála to have a higher order.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">Had the Minister examined the economics of a public private partnership he would have had some fans in Merrion Street.  This would not involve a legal intervention in the planning process or an undermining of the Minister's statutory requirement, under both Environmental Protection Agency legislation and local government and planning legislation not to interfere in statutory areas of the planning process.  The Minister is ultimately responsible for the Vote of money that will come from his Department, sanctioned in this House, to all local authorities.  The economics of this incinerator are crazy and Mr. Joe McCarthy will bring this to the Minister's attention, if he has not already done so.  So-called "Crazy Joe McCarthy" was, as officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will realise, the person who, along with others, eventually blew the whistle on the nonsense of e-voting.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">Based on various calculations required under law, the economics of public private partnership are built on a foundation of sand.  The waste management planning regulations of 1997 require a waste management plan to include systems for monitoring the before, during and after of any changes made by the plan.  The waste management plan agreed by the elected members of Dublin City Council in point 11.3.2 on page 77 require city officials to record such statistics but they will not make that information available to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">There is a dispute among officials at local and national levels regarding the legal and statistical basis upon which certain formal calculations are made.

What kind of nonsense is this?  Who invented this rule?</p>
            <p eId="para_876">We will be paying the money for this project.  There was a time when public projects were put up for tender and, under the laws of public procurement, the lowest price did not automatically win the contract.  The best suited contractor, when price and experience were taken into account, would win the contract but every other competitor in the public procurement process would be informed of the outcome of the tendering process.  Suddenly this information is secret and cannot be obtained due to commercial sensitivities.  That was the explanation Mr. Matt Twomey, assistant city manager, gave the public when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and I were both on this side of the House and queried Deputy Gormley's predecessor on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Who else is bidding to build an incinerator in the Dublin area and what commercial sensitivity applies?  What legal advice did the Minister take from lawyers in the Green Party regarding his manoeuvrability on this issue?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, correctly says that our former constituency colleague, Mr. Michael McDowell, did not sit in the Custom House as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform and did not possess the statutory powers of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this regard.  Mr. McDowell was merely a Cabinet colleague and he could ask and make requests, but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has executive powers which he is failing to implement in terms of value for money and the legal constraints on the contract that has been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Nobody knows the terms of the contract agreed with DONG.  We do not know if they are compliant and we do not know if they are costed.  I am sure Merrion Street would like information in this regard.  Earlier today we were told that public scrutiny by the Opposition in this House is being eroded systematically.  We can no longer ask questions about the Health Service Executive and prosecutions of people who do not pay the television licence fee.  I thought the Green Party went into Government to avoid the shackles of impotence that are being imposed on the Opposition.  I thought the purpose of having the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, at the Cabinet table was to allow them request this information.  I thought they could use their extensive powers to get a second opinion and to review the commercial viability of the Poolbeg incinerator, because we are ahead of our targets for waste reduction and the volume of incinerable waste is falling.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">Can the Minister examine the change in circumstances regarding access to the site?  In case he does not know I can tell the Minister, as one of his constituents, that from 4 p.m. until around 7 p.m., from the Merrion Gates or the Martello tower to the toll bridge, traffic is back to back.  The Minister knows, from living in Ringsend, what traffic is like.  Now we are to be asked to allow more trucks into the area, though we cannot get the precise number calculated from Mr. Matt Twomey.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell is recognised by all in this House as a person who knows the traffic statistics for the greater Dublin area and she points out that the traffic implications of the location of the Poolbeg incinerator may be serious.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The acting leader of the Green Party has given the Minister plenty of cover for tonight but when he has time he might tell the people in Ringsend Park, Sandymount and O'Rahilly House not what he did in the past, not how he saved the world from bio-burn and so on, but rather how he consciously compromised his principles to go into office.  On balance, the Minister felt he could do some good inside the tent and I can accept that logic and have applied it to myself previously.  Now the Minister must deliver and must find every instrument of power and ingenuity open to him.  He must not take no for an answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">I once received no for an answer when I was told that under EU law I could not ban the importation of South African fruit.  The Attorney General of the time said it was not possible but, because I wanted to find an answer and would not take no for an answer, we ultimately found a legally viable solution to the conundrum.  If being a Green Party member in Cabinet means anything the Minister must start finding answers soon.  He can start by tearing up the ridiculous script he read into the record of the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">As regards matters about which Deputy Sargent feels passionate, his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, with the able assistance of the then aspiring TD, Deputy Chris Andrews, promised his neighbours and constituents he would make the difference.  He hounded a Cabinet Minister and promised to stop the Poolbeg incinerator.  He now has his chance to do so.  Will he override the policy instructions on incineration issued to An Bord Pleanála?  Will he examine the economics, statistics and volumes in the contract for the public private partnership?  Will he discard the cover provided by Matt Twomey of Dublin City Council and others regarding commercial sensitivity by publishing details of the contract?  Let us see how we will be ripped off under the PPP, as has been the case in some of the motorway contracts where a multiple of the real cost will be paid in interest above and beyond the Euribor rate.

            <p eId="para_887">The sentiment expressed in the motion could be applied directly to Cork South-Central where a similar issue of major concern to residents of the Cork Harbour area has emerged.  The people of the area will watch this debate with interest because, to use a pun, it is an opportunity to read the temperature in terms of determining the Green Party's position on incineration.  I call for a clear statement setting out the position of the new Government.  Specifically, I call on the Green Party leadership to make a clear statement showing that it still reflects the views of communities and groups, including its party members, it claimed to represent on the issue of incineration.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">This debate could be sidetracked and become a debate on waste in general.  The motion is about incineration and debate on it offers an opportunity to determine the Government's stance on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">Members of the public are justifiably sceptical about waste management policy.  Over the years, policymakers have failed to meet their commitments on waste management and neglected to inform members of the public about developments in this area.  The reduce, reuse and recycle approach — known as triple R — has failed with massive teething problems, of which I can cite many examples, still to be ironed out.  The triple R approach arose from the hierarchy concept used in an EU directive.  It referred to reaching sustainability by introducing a waste management programme based on approaches other than disposal.  Unfortunately, disposal remains our primary waste management policy.  The failure to introduce waste recovery creates the rationale for incineration.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">To cite one example of the lack of joined-up thinking on waste management, five different companies collect waste in a single corner block in my constituency of Cork South-Central.  As the block straddles the city and county boundaries, two municipal authorities provide waste collection services.  Three private companies also collect waste in the area.  Two years ago, Cork City Council decided to establish sites to which people could bring paper, bottles and other recyclable materials.  At the same time, the county council introduced a pay-by-weight system under which waste charges are calculated according to the weight of the waste collected.  This led to people in one local authority area bringing their recyclabes to another local authority area, with the result that Cork City Council removed its recovery facilities.  The joined-up thinking needed on waste policy failed to materialise.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Councils are actively engaging in strategies aimed at eliminating their role in waste management, specifically collection.  The result will be a democratic deficit in which local authorities have no role or monitoring function in waste management.  This became clear in the Indaver case in Cork when local authorities and planners were overruled.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">Recent television pictures of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, holding an umbrella on Sandymount Strand brought to mind an image of Mary Poppins.  Perhaps we are seeing how a spoonful of ministerial sugar can make the medicine go down.  While it was easy for the Minister to take certain positions on the Opposition benches, to continue with the sugar analogy, he must take it or lump it and it appears he will lump it.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">The motion presents an opportunity for the new Minister and his party colleagues to put daylight between themselves and the Minister's predecessor who, it is generally agreed, has a poor record in the area of waste management.  It is a chance to take a new direction and demonstrate that new thinking has arrived in the Department.  We will see over the lifetime of this Dáil whether this is a new Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Speaking to people in the Cork region who have dealt with the Green Party on the incineration issue for more than a decade, it became clear that the Dáil's decision on this motion will set the tone for the Government's approach to waste management for the next five years and determine whether incineration remains on the agenda.  I hope the Green Party will take a clear and consistent position when the House divides and that having taken ministerial office, its position on incineration will not go up in smoke.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_393">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_895">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">Two months ago my Sinn Féin elected colleagues in the north-east region and I presented the media with copies of a document we had received, which spells out in detail the Health Service Executive plans for acute hospital services in the north east, including costings, staff reductions and timeframes.  The HSE and the Government did not want this document to enter the public arena before the general election.  They sought to conceal the full facts regarding their plans for the future of services at Monaghan and Cavan general hospitals, the Louth Hospital in Dundalk, Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda but we fully exposed them.  The plans include the following: the further loss of services at Monaghan General Hospital; the reduction in treatment room services to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven-day service by 2008; the transfer of acute medicine from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital by July 2008, with the loss of 5.5 whole-time equivalent posts; the transfer of all Monaghan critical care patients to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; closure of the Monaghan high or critical care unit; all in-patient activity to be non-acute and nurse-led; Monaghan General Hospital to become an ambulatory care facility providing diagnostics, rehabilitation and related services, with a target date of July 2008; increases in ambulance staff and vehicles to accommodate increased movement of patients within and to services beyond the region; one bed increase in ITU capacity at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to accommodate the transfer of critically-ill patients from Monaghan; the establishment of a single department of anaesthesia within the Cavan-Monaghan hospitals group with a target date of February 2008; key pathology posts to be Cavan and Drogheda-based, with a reduction in overall staffing of 15 by July 2009; and psychiatric services priority 1 — as it is described — acute psychiatric services to be located on a new regional hospital site, with all this entails for the St. Davnet's hospital facility in Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The Monaghan high dependence care unit was to close by Sunday last, 1 July, but this has not yet happened, thank God.  We need to know if and when it will happen, or whether public pressure has caused the HSE to relent on this latest cut, which I hope has happened.  Following the initial further transfer of services and workload from Monaghan to Cavan, and from Dundalk and Navan to Drogheda, and with a projected staff reduction of 48 by July 2009, the Teamwork implementation project sets 2012 as the target date for the establishment of a new regional hospital that will incorporate all acute and planned inpatient activity for the region upon which, it states, all existing hospitals in the region, including Cavan General Hospital, will become ambulatory centres.  The document which we revealed refers to the proposed changes as presenting "major opportunities for savings, efficiencies and staff redeployment".  It also refers to front-line staff reductions and the savings that will result as a consequence.  Savings of €2.2 million in 2007 and €5 million in 2008 are projected.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">This was a damning exposure of the real intent and purpose of the Teamwork recommendations.  Improved services and patient safety get scant mention in the text of this implementation document.  The real intent of the HSE and the Government towards hospital services in the north east has been shown as never before.  I call on the Government to state categorically to the people of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth that it has at last seen the folly of its approach to acute hospital services and health care in general in the north east and will withdraw their support for the Hanley-Teamwork proposals, and instead commit their long-awaited support for the network of hospitals across this region and throughout the State.  I call on the Green Party in particular to honour the signed pledge it gave to the people of County Monaghan in the course of the recent general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">What is needed is a radical change in the direction of health care policy in both the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  Democratic accountability must return to the office of the Minister and services must return to our local hospitals.  The Sinn Féin vision of health care is one that truly places the patient first and is geared to meeting the needs of communities.  Sinn Féin will remain committed to the pledge it gave in support of Monaghan General Hospital and the retention and development of the network of smaller hospitals across this State.  For us, our pledge is our word.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_900">I take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am sure the House will join with me in extending our sympathies to the Minister on the death of her mother.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising the matter.  The Teamwork Management Services Limited report, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards, provides a detailed assessment of hospital services and recommends an action plan for health services in the north east.  The report finds that the present system, whereby five local hospitals deliver acute care to a relatively small population, has exposed patients to increased risks.  The report recommends a three strand action plan as follows: the development of local services, with the existing five hospitals and primary and community care providers playing central roles; the development of a new regional acute hospital; and the development of a series of clinical networks which bind these local and regional services and are centred around the needs of patients, including networks for emergency care, surgery and critical care.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">The Teamwork report includes a number of recommendations to improve patient care in the region.  It particularly highlights the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service in line with international standards.  It recommends that there be one major regional hospital in the north east, supported by the five existing local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24-hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE steering group which is leading the project.  A sub-committee of the steering group was established to progress the issue of site selection.  Following a tendering process, the HSE appointed consultants to carry out an independent site location study.  The study, which the HSE expects to be finalised in August, will take account of various criteria including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure the people of the north east have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency inpatient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, services at the existing five hospitals will continue to be improved.  The Department of Health and Children has been advised that the existing hospitals will continue to provide services which meet the majority of health needs of the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The HSE advises that the implementation plan will involve some level of redeployment of existing staff but that the plan will result in an increase in the overall number of staff in the region.  The HSE has given an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_907">I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle on their appointment.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue, which is dear to my heart.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">In 2005 a young woman died tragically, leaving two young children, aged six months and 18 months at the time.  To compound this tragedy, her husband suffered a severe stroke six weeks later, was incapacitated and could not look after his children.  The children's aunt, who is from south Kerry, took in the children the day after the man had the stroke, which was in September 2005.  Following many efforts to secure a foster care grant from the State to look after the two children, they have not received a cent from the State almost two years on.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who are placed in foster care or relative care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995.  The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group entitled, Foster Care — A Child Centred Partnership, a title I will bear in mind.  The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives.  These are as follows: that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that the relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; and that a partnership approach should be used to develop skills and support for relatives providing foster care.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">I can vouch for these people under each of these headings.  The problem, however, is that they have received no foster care or help from the State.  The woman who has taken in these children should have received a medal as well as monetary assistance for providing all the care set out under the principles for placements with relatives.  The best interests of the children are being cared for and the children are placed in "an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment".  These people are precluded from receiving the foster care allowance because under the Child Care Act 1991 the children in respect of whom the allowances are paid must be in the care of the Health Service Executive on either a voluntary basis or by court order.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">This lady took these children in the day after their father had a severe stroke, which was little more than six weeks after their mother died.  Their father was incapacitated and could not look after them.  I cannot understand why this woman has not been helped in giving these children love, attention and support.  She has given them a ready made family.  She has since had a child of her own and the children are in a secure environment but because they were not taken into the care of the HSE they are precluded from the foster care grant.  I urge the Minister of State to do all in his power to help these two children who are in a safe, healthy environment.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_397" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_912">I add my congratulations to those of Deputy Sheahan on Deputy Howlin's appointment as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It was remiss of me not to do so earlier.  I also congratulate Deputy Sheahan on his election to the Dáil and I wish him well here.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Deputy Sheahan will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on an individual case.  I will, however, outline the current legislation and policy which underpin the foster care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">The Health Service Executive is required under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Where a child requires care or protection that he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is taken into care, the HSE must take the child into its care and provide the most appropriate form of alternative care for that child.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the HSE under the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations 1995.  In 1998 the then Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children set up a working group on foster care.  The task of the working group was to make recommendations on all aspects of foster care.  The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group entitled Foster Care — A Child Centred Partnership.  The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives.  These are as follows: the best interests of the child are paramount; the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care; and placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">While it is not relevant to the case raised by the Deputy, the working group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the HSE in order to provide income support for the family in respect of the child.  The group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate.  Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and people in need of such support should contact that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The working group stated that children should be brought into the care of the HSE if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act.  In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child's individual best interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">Under the legislation, the HSE must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan.  The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives.  The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">I understand from the HSE that in this case the children in question are not in the statutory care of the executive and as such the foster care allowance is not payable.  The family concerned may, however, wish to apply for a guardian's payment in respect of the children.  The payment of this allowance is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">These payments are made directly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, normally to the child's guardian, and are intended to provide income maintenance in respect of children satisfying certain qualifying criteria.  The circumstances in which these payments are made and the level of payment are determined by that Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_921">This may appear to be a small issue but it is important.  The Cabra West youth service has been operating for two decades in a school in an area with which the Minister of State is probably familiar as it is just across the border from Finglas.  The Taoiseach gave out prizes in the school last Thursday morning.  The next day the board of management told the Cabra West youth service that it could no longer expect to use part of the premises as an office.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The service has had the resource of the primary school as its headquarters from which it has operated a community employment scheme employing 19 people locally and most important, has provided a service for the young people in the area.  Cabra presents many difficulties for the social services, and for young people growing up in the area, as the Minister of State knows.  There is significant drug abuse in Cabra.  The youth service has provided sporting and recreational clubs, and homework facilities, all of which help to keep young people on the straight and narrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">In many parts of the north inner city and further afield, primary schools do not close their doors at 3 p.m. but provide greater resources to the community by allowing various CE schemes, youth services and senior citizens' groups to operate on their premises.  It seems that this resource is being closed down.  The only information the youth service has received is that it must leave the premises and seek alternative accommodation, perhaps across the road in a senior citizens' complex under development.  That is not a suitable location for a youth service.  Besides, there is no provision in the local authority's plans for a senior citizens' development to include facilities for a youth service.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The youth service is high and dry at the start of the summer and does not know how it will operate.  It is extremely disappointing that a service that was provided on those premises for over two decades should now be turfed out at short notice and told not to return during the summer or in the autumn when the school re-opens.  I want to highlight the situation whereby a service will be lost and local jobs are at risk.  There will be a serious impact on the local community.  I know the Minister of State is not directly responsible for the board but, in the context of the broader educational and resource requirements, is there any possibility the Department of Education and Science can make it known that it is anxious to ensure the service is retained, ideally on the premises from which it operates at present?  Can it make it known to the board that it looks very kindly on the provision of services of this nature for young people?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_925">I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  As the Deputy said, I am well aware of this project as both he and I were both members of the City of Dublin VEC and the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, which were instrumental in helping the project progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The issue provides me with the opportunity to explain to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on the ownership of school properties in the State.  It is not commonly understood that the vast majority of our school buildings, both primary and post-primary, are privately owned and managed institutions and that the ultimate responsibility for their usage outside of their principal purpose rests with the trustees or the board of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">One of the issues regularly raised with the Department by local and community interests is the use of spare school facilities or the use of school facilities outside of school time for community education and recreation purposes.  These requests have come from a variety of bodies including county development boards, community groups and the National Children's Office.  The Department issued a circular letter to schools in 2005 urging trustees and boards of management to give serious consideration to such requests where possible.  In urging school authorities to respond sensitively to this need, the Department fully appreciates that, as already stated, the decision ultimately lies with the relevant board or trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Many schools already make their premises available to the local community outside of school hours and schools benefit from the improved relationship with the wider community.  Good relations between the school and the community can be beneficial when it comes to seeking placements for work experience, outlets for community service or when schools seek to access local services and expertise.  Being linked in effectively with the local community can help the school to provide a wider curriculum and range of co-curricular activities.  It is for this reason that the Department publication "Looking at our Schools: an aid to self-evaluation for primary and post-primary schools", <i> </i>suggests that the relationship between the school and the wider community should form one of the self-evaluation criteria for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The Department also acknowledges the need for trustees and boards to prioritise the interests of the principal school users and to protect their own interests.  The Department has given advice to schools in key areas in this regard including the need to have a proper licensing agreement in place.  With regard to St. Finbar's national school, again the Department does not own the site or the building in which the Cabra West Youth Services, CWYS, is accommodated and the Department is not privy to the school's arrangement with this group.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">It is the Department's understanding that the CWYS is funded primarily by the City of Dublin Youth Service Board.  The board has indicated to the Department that it is aware of the accommodation issues in question and that negotiations are ongoing with the school authority to resolve them.  Given that what is in question here is a private arrangement, this is the correct procedure to address this matter and the Department of Education and Science has no role to play in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.  I hope I have explained that, while the Department fully supports and encourages the use of school properties not in its ownership by community and other groups, the decision in these matters rests with school authorities and it is a matter for them to safeguard their own positions where such arrangements are made and to resolve any difficulties arising therefrom.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">I give an undertaking to Deputy Costello to raise the matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, youth work and school transport, Deputy Haughey, and with other related agencies.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_401">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_934">I wish to share time with Deputy P.J. Sheehan.  It is important to let Deputy Sheehan have his say on this incident as it took place a couple of hundred yards from his home.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Last night and today people have being following the extraordinary story of attempted drug smuggling off the west Cork coast, near Goleen.  Garda sources now say that up to 1.5 tonnes of baled cocaine have been recovered from the sea next to an upturned inflatable boat.  This, the largest drugs haul in the history of the State, happened by chance and because of the weather and the incompetence of the gang of men involved.  The street value of the enormous haul of drugs is estimated to be as high as €300 million.  Make no mistake, this should be given the priority of a major international drug smuggling incident.  We need to learn lessons from what happened and put measures in place to reduce the likelihood of it happening again.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">It is not the first time we have seen seizures of drugs off the south-west coast.  In  July 1991, cannabis worth €9 million was seized in Courtmacsherry; in July 1993 cannabis worth €25 million was found off the Clare coast; in September 1996 cocaine worth €125 million was found on a trawler in Cork harbour; in September 1998 cocaine worth €61 million was found on a catamaran yacht in Kinsale harbour; and in November 1999 cannabis worth €18 million was discovered off the south-west coast by the Naval Service.  Now, cocaine worth between €200 million and €300 million has been found in Goleen.  It is not surprising, therefore, that senior customs officers state Ireland is perceived as a soft touch for criminal gangs for their drug trafficking activities in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">The Taoiseach's response today in the Dáil was nothing short of pathetic.  Apart from saying that we were talking to our EU partners about how best to counteract drug smuggling and announcing the setting up of a monitoring centre in Lisbon, he had little or nothing to say about Ireland's state of preparedness to combat drug smuggling.  Yes, we do need to work with other countries which face similar challenges, but we can certainly do something more ourselves within Irish waters in the meantime.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The truth is that we are, indeed, a soft touch for drug smugglers in having an open, largely unpatrolled coastline. We have a competent but small Naval Service, an under-resourced coastguard and an inadequate customs structure in terms of policing and monitoring activity along our coastline.  If this incident, which happened purely by accident, does not jolt us into a frank and honest debate about how we invest in the fight against drug trafficking then what will?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PJSheenan" eId="spk_402">
            <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
            <p eId="para_939">I thank Deputy Coveney for allowing me two minutes of his time.  The find of a massive cocaine haul off the coast of south-west Cork in Dunlough Bay, near Mizen Head, yesterday, 2 July 2007, was valued at more than €300 million, making it the biggest drugs find in the history of the State.  Priority must be given to policing our coastline, involving investment in our coastal defences, gardaí in coastal areas, the coastguard services, the Naval Service and the Customs and Excise.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Did a CASA patrol aeroplane monitor this area in the 48 hours prior to this event?  A CASA patrol aeroplane monitors every Irish fishing trawler that leaves our ports and the Irish Naval Service intercepts them in Irish territorial waters and investigates them.  How was this international yacht free to enter Irish waters with her deadly haul of cocaine worth €300 million and to put it aboard RIB inflated crafts to bring ashore in Dunlough Bay in my constituency, five miles from where I live?</p>
            <p eId="para_941">The Taoiseach, in his reply today, said there would be an international monitoring conference in Lisbon and that he had been in communication with the relevant people.  The State did not hear about this incident until the Goleen inshore rescue service was called out on humanitarian grounds to rescue three people clinging onto the raft in Dunlough Bay, after one had swum ashore to raise the alarm at 7 a.m., which alerted the authorities.  The Goleen inshore rescue service was the only service that was called to the area.  This is not proper management of our coastal area and I urge the Government to take immediate steps to arrest a practice that has been going on for years.  The Minister and the Government have been warned about this over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The time is ripe for action and not pious words.  Actions speak louder than words.  The Government will have to act before it is too late and I appeal to the Minister of State to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_403" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_943">I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I thank Deputies Coveney and Sheehan for raising this important matter in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">All Members share a sense of relief that the attempt to import a massive amount of cocaine into west Cork on Sunday night and Monday morning failed.  I commend the efforts of the Garda Síochána, the customs service, the Naval Service and the coast guard on the operation which has been taking place there over the past couple of days.  I acknowledge the great amount of support and assistance they received in their efforts from members of the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The House will appreciate that this matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation from which criminal charges would be expected to ensue so there are some constraints on what I can say.  I understand that the Minister met with the Garda Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner for operations earlier this evening about a range of matters and has been fully briefed on the incident.  I also understand that he has been assured by the Commissioner of the Garda's determination to bring its investigation into this matter to a successful conclusion and that no resources will be spared.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The basic facts are by now fairly well known.  At 8 a.m. yesterday, Bantry Garda station was alerted to a situation at Dunlough Bay, Mizen Head, where a type of vessel known as a RIB had reportedly ran aground on rocks in heavy seas.  One of the occupants of the RIB swam ashore and called to a local residence where the emergency services were alerted.  This person was taken by ambulance to Bantry General Hospital.  A second person was rescued from the sea and also taken to the hospital.  The submerged RIB was 100 yd. off the shoreline in rough seas, together with a large number of floating parcels.  Sixty bales, each containing 25 kg. of what is believed to be cocaine, were recovered and removed to Bantry Garda station where an incident room has been established.  Three vehicles which are believed to have been linked to the attempted importation have been seized and are being technically examined at Bantry Garda station.  The two people removed to the hospital are obviously central to the Garda investigation, but others suspected to have been involved in the attempted importation are also being sought as part of an intensive Garda operation.  A full search of the coastline was resumed at first light this morning.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">This incident is a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by all of the agencies involved in trying to prevent drugs being imported into the country, either for use in Ireland, or as is likely to be the case here, for onward transmission to other countries.  Nobody should underestimate the difficulties posed by the nature and extent — some 3,000 miles — of our coastline.  Under the national drugs strategy, the customs service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  However, the strategy recognises the vital importance of co-operation between the customs service and the Garda Síochána — for which Deputy Brian Lenihan is the accountable Minister — as well as the Naval Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">While a certain amount may be achieved by random patrols of our waters, the priority must be intelligence-based targeted activities by all the agencies involved.  In terms of intelligence gathering and sharing of information, the agencies here co-operate fully not only among themselves but with their counterparts in organisations such as Europol, the World Customs Organisation, the United Nations Drug Control Programme and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency in the UK.  On the role of the Garda Síochána, for example, Garda liaison officers are based at London, Paris, The Hague, Madrid and Europol.  The work of the customs service in monitoring our rugged and indented coastline is based on risk analysis and intelligence-led enforcement.  Mobile anti-smuggling teams operate from key strategic locations.  These officers are engaged in intelligence gathering and in operational interventions.  This type of enforcement strategy is in keeping with best international practice.  The customs service drugs watch programme is also in place to encourage the coastal and maritime communities to assist in confidentially reporting suspicious activity and a dedicated freephone is in operation on a 24-7 basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">In order to enhance the State's capability to protect the community from drug trafficking by sea, the Revenue Commissioners deployed the customs cutter, <i>Suirbhéir</i>, in 2004.  This vessel is currently engaged in the search operation.  The Revenue Commissioners constantly monitor the adequacy of the controls that are in place in response to emerging trends and risks as identified both nationally and internationally.  Co-operation with other customs services and law enforcement agencies abroad is also an important aspect of this work and such co-operation and intelligence exchange is well established and effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">In light of recent events I am glad, on behalf of the Minister, to be able to inform the House of a very significant initiative which is under way, namely, the establishment in Lisbon of a new maritime analysis and operational centre.  The centre is intended to focus on targeting the sea cocaine routes from Central and South America into the European Union.  It will collect and analyse operational information, enhance intelligence through better information exchange, and ascertain the availability of assets to facilitate interdictions in accordance with the national laws of the participants involved.  The UK, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, France and the Netherlands will participate in the work of the centre.  I have made clear my full support for this initiative in which the Garda Síochána, the customs service and the Naval Service will be involved.  Officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are to travel to Lisbon next week when I expect that the text of an agreement on Ireland's participation will be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">I mentioned earlier the support which has been forthcoming from the local community in west Cork.  It is important to stress that, as well as international intelligence, there is obviously a key role for people in coastal areas to report any unusual activities.  If people notice unusual objects at sea, underwater or ashore, ships being met by small craft, or vessels operating at night without lights, then they should pass this information on to the appropriate authorities.  Both the customs service and the Garda operate coastal alert schemes to encourage this practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The subject of this Adjournment matter specifically relates to the interdiction of drugs at sea but we should not overlook the fact that when drugs find their way into the country considerable efforts are made by the Garda to track them down and seize them.   For example, between 2004 and 2006 over €40 million worth of cocaine was seized.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">It is inevitable that an incident of this kind leads to speculation about what attempts there may have been to import drugs in this way which may have been successful and about which the authorities know nothing.  Of its nature, that is speculation for which no hard evidence exists, but in 2005 the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that global seizures of cocaine amounted to 44% of cocaine production.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">I have listened carefully to the helpful contribution which Deputies Coveney and Sheehan made during this debate.  The events of the past couple of days have underlined the fact that the efforts of all the agencies involved to combat this deadly trade must be relentless.  For its part, the Government will continue to provide all the resources that are necessary.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_957">Together with our EU partners, Ireland has consistently expressed strong support for the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy, the former Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, and his team since they commenced work over a year ago on the challenging and complex issue of Kosovo's final status. Ireland believes that the comprehensive proposal of Special Envoy Ahtisaari provides the most practical basis for a settlement of the Kosovo issue by a new Resolution of the UN Security Council, to replace Security Council Resolution 1244 under which Kosovo has been governed since 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The declared aim of Special Envoy Ahtisaari's Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo status settlement is to define the provisions necessary for a future Kosovo that is viable, sustainable and stable. His recommendation is that Kosovo's status should be independence, supervised by the international community. The proposal includes detailed provisions concerning the promotion and protection of the rights of communities and their members, the effective decentralisation of government, and the preservation and protection of cultural and religious heritage. It also sets out constitutional, economic and security measures, aimed at contributing to the development of a multi-ethnic, democratic and prosperous Kosovo. A key element of the proposed settlement would be the mandate provided for a future international civilian and military presence in Kosovo, to supervise implementation of the Settlement and assist the competent Kosovo authorities in ensuring peace and stability throughout Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">These detailed proposals are the product of more than twelve months of negotiations involving the parties in Belgrade and Pristina under the chairmanship of the Special Envoy and his team. Following from these discussions, Special Envoy Ahtisaari has been clear in his view that there is no likelihood of agreement between the parties on the status issue itself, and that his comprehensive and balanced proposals therefore represent the only practical basis for Kosovo's final status.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">While we would ideally have preferred to see the Kosovo issue resolved on the basis of full agreement between all the parties, we share the Special Envoy's view that his proposal represents the most practicable solution in all of the prevailing historical and political circumstances. We therefore continue to urge intensified efforts within the UN Security Council to agree on a new Resolution which will provide the basis for implementation of this proposal. Once a new Resolution is agreed, the EU will play the lead role in international efforts to support the implementation of the final status settlement. It is likely that Ireland will contribute to the EU role in Kosovo through the involvement of the Garda in the planned ESDP civilian Mission. We will also step up our existing participation in the NATO-led and UN–mandated KFOR force, as we take on from this summer the role of Framework Nation of the Multinational Task Force (Centre), covering the capital Pristina and the surrounding area.</p>

            <p eId="para_963">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 147 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">The recent statements from Russia that it may aim missiles at targets in Europe were part of its reaction to the news that the US intends to deploy elements of a missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic. The European Union does not have an agreed position on missile defence, a matter on which it has no competence. This is a question for decision by individual Member States and a matter more appropriate for discussion within NATO, of which Poland and the Czech Republic are both members. The matter was raised during the recent EU-Russia Summit in Samara by the Russian side which made reference to enormous security implications arising from the US intentions. The Presidency made clear, in response, that it saw the matter as more appropriate to discussion within and with NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Ireland's own position is clear. We share the concerns expressed regarding missile defence systems. We believe that the development of missile defence systems can have many negative consequences, including creating or aggravating missile arms races. The most effective way to tackle missile proliferation and the attendant threats is to engage in serious work in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. Ireland has always played a very active role in such efforts, particularly within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).</p>
            <p eId="para_966">Further reductions in nuclear arsenals, with the aim of their total elimination, offer the best approach to addressing security concerns in this area. The development of missile defence systems, on the other hand, has the potential to create a destabilising effect in the region and could induce some countries to expand their missile arsenals or to develop new missiles that might better penetrate defences.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">We would urge all sides to refrain from inflammatory and threatening language and to engage in constructive dialogue. Despite the harsh rhetoric, there are some hopeful indicators in this regard. President Bush and President Putin spoke in the margins of the recent G8 Summit in Heiligendamm in Germany, and they continued their discussions when President Putin visited Kennebunkport in the US earlier this week and apparently elaborated on his proposal for a shared missile defence system based in Azerbaijan. It is not clear what the next steps may be, but it is positive that the two sides are in discussion. In their joint remarks to the press yesterday, both President Bush and President Putin spoke of the need to expand the dialogue to include European countries and indicated that it might be useful to do so through the NATO-Russia Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">The then Minister of State, Noel Treacy, TD, raised the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi at the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nuremberg on 14-15 March, as well as directly with the Foreign Minister of Burma in a bilateral discussion. Ireland also joined EU partners at the ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Hamburg on 28-29 May, in the presence of the Burmese Foreign Minister, in forcefully condemning the decision to renew the detention order on Aung San Suu Kyi . Ministers at both meetings called for a lifting of restrictions on political parties and the early release of all those under detention.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">Ireland and our EU partners continue to apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures to Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position. In renewing the Common Position in April, the Council adopted Conclusions clearly stating the EU's deep concern on the lack of progress in the promised transition towards a legitimate civilian government, and calling for the early release of all political prisoners and an end to the military campaign against civilians in conflict areas. We also expressed our concerns about serious violations of human rights, restrictions on domestic human rights organisations and international human rights institutions by the government of Burma. Ireland played a leading role in preparing the draft Conclusions and in gaining agreement for their adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">With EU partners, Ireland strongly supports the use of the UN Secretary General's good offices to bring about peaceful political change in Burma. We welcome UNSG Ban Ki-moon's appointment on 22 May of Ibraham Gambari as his Special Adviser on Burma. It is important that the Burmese government co-operate with the Secretary General's good offices mission to make tangible progress on the protection of human rights in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to raise this issue with the Burmese authorities on all possible occasions and to ensure that it remains firmly on the international political agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_976">The United States maintains what it regards as fundamental concerns in relation to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Although the US signed the Rome Statute in December 2000, in May 2002, it informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that it did not intend to become a party to the Statute, and that accordingly it had no obligations arising from its signature. The objections of the United States to the ICC are based on its view that, because of the independence of the Court's prosecutor, US citizens and in particular its military forces could be subjected to politically motivated prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">As I have stated previously, while I recognise these concerns, I do not share them and nor are they shared by our EU partners. The jurisdiction of the ICC is complementary to national jurisdictions, meaning that the Court will become involved in a case only where a state with jurisdiction over a crime is unwilling or unable to carry out a genuine investigation or prosecution. The Rome Statute contains strong and carefully drafted safeguards to prevent politically motivated prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The EU has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC, and has taken a leading role internationally in promoting the Court. The Council of the European Union, in their Conclusions of 30 September 2002, sought to develop a broader dialogue between the European Union and the United States on all matters related to the ICC. The EU remains willing to engage in such dialogue and maintains contact with the US on the matter, most recently, in June of this year, when the Legal Adviser to the United States Secretary of State, Mr John Bellinger III, met with the EU Council Working Group on the International Criminal Court in Brussels. The Group, which comprises representatives from each Member State, was established to help develop and promote EU policy on the ICC.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">At the meeting in Brussels, Mr. Bellinger restated the position of the United States towards the ICC. However his visit also provided a useful opportunity to discuss a number of related issues, including co-operation with the Court, the use of the Court's facilities by the Special Court for Sierra Leone and bilateral immunity agreements entered into by the United States, which seek to prevent the surrender of US personnel to the Court. Both sides expressed a willingness to remain in contact on the issue.</p>

The Optional Protocol entered into force on 22 June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">The object of the Protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken both by an independent international body and by national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The international body is to be a subcommittee of the UN Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. At the national level, States Parties are required to maintain, designate or establish one or more bodies for the prevention of torture at the domestic level.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">As regards our signature of the Optional Protocol with a view to subsequent ratification, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the Dáil on Tuesday, 8 November 2005, that he would review national legislation to ascertain whether legislative changes would be required before signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has now drafted a memorandum requesting the authority of the Government to arrange for the signature, subject to ratification, of the Optional Protocol. The Department of Foreign Affairs will be making the necessary arrangements for signature as soon as this approval is received. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently in the process of preparing the necessary legislation to enable ratification to take place.</p>

            <p eId="para_996">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place in early 2008 on completion of the premises. It will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 101 posts or approximately 82% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised. An advance party involving over 50 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">As regards development specialists, they perform an important role in the business of Irish Aid. The specialists work alongside diplomatic and general service staff, in close contact and co-operation with each business unit within the Division. There are a number of issues to be worked out with regard to the specialist posts which are scheduled to move. Discussions are ongoing at a very senior level with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Progress has been made and I hope that these discussions can be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date. Until these sensitive discussions are concluded, it would be premature to speculate on the number of specialist posts which might be decentralised to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">In addition to the development specialist posts at Headquarters, there are 20 development specialists attached to Embassies in our programme countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">I should point out that almost all of the senior management team for Limerick are in place. In this regard, the Director General of Irish Aid will be decentralising to Limerick. Four Counsellors/ Principal Officers have already decentralised as part of the advance party and a further three Counsellors/Principal Officers in the Directorate will be decentralising. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">As stated in the Programme for Government, decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">The Government has consistently supported, and remains fully committed to, the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara. Ireland continues to be active on the issue in discussions at EU level and at the United Nations. The Government strongly supports the continuing engagement of the UN in the search for a political solution in the Western Sahara based on the principle of self-determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Following detailed internal consultations, the Government of Morocco has recently brought forward its proposals for the future of the Western Sahara. These set out in general terms a vision of an autonomous Government in the Territory, operating under Moroccan sovereignty. In response the Polisario Front, representing the Saharawi people, has set out its position in favour of the creation of an independent State in close association with Morocco, and with protection for Moroccan vital interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">Although there is clearly a broad gap between these two competing visions, I regard it as a positive and helpful development that both parties have set out their proposals for the future, and the measures they can envisage to accommodate the concerns of the other side. Ireland has not taken a position on the future of the Territory, be it full independence, autonomy, or integration under Moroccan sovereignty. The important point is that the status of the Territory should be decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination by the people of the Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">I am encouraged that, following the publication of the two sets of proposals, representatives of Morocco and the Polisario Front met in New York on 18 June, under the auspices of the United Nations. This was an initial contact, but it undoubtedly represents a positive development following a period of political stalemate. We will continue to encourage the engagement of the parties and the involvement of the UN, including the Personal Representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Van Walsum, with the objective of a just and lasting political settlement for the people of the Western Sahara.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1021">I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 162, 163 and 277 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place early in 2008 on completion of the premises which are currently under construction. It will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 101 posts or approximately 82% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised. An advance party involving over 50 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The current staffing position is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1024">66 posts in Irish Aid are filled by officers who have either already taken part in the advance move or signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. The majority of positions filled are in the diplomatic and general service grades at all levels. Importantly, the key posts of Director General, seven Counsellors/Principal Officers (heads of section) and the Financial Controller are filled by personnel who are moving to Limerick.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1025">A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1026">In addition, 18 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">As regards development specialists, they perform an important role in the business of Irish Aid. The specialists work alongside diplomatic and general service staff, in close contact and co-operation with each business unit within the Division. There are a number of issues still to be resolved with regard to the specialist posts which are scheduled to move. Discussions are ongoing at a very senior level with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Progress has been made and I hope that these discussions can be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The transfer of Irish Aid to Limerick presents significant challenges. Risk management issues are being addressed through planning and risk management strategies. This involves adequate handover periods in order to ensure the retention of corporate memory. Appropriate training and induction courses are being provided and will continue to be provided for new staff. Staffing changes have been and continue to be phased in order to facilitate this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">As stated in the Programme for Government, decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1033">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 109 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The Government remains gravely concerned by the horrific violence in Iraq. The violence has effectively stalled the political process and continues to threaten the stability of the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">There are no simple solutions to the chaos across large areas of Iraq. The situation is now extremely complex, involving many different groups, with diverse motivations, seeking to assert local control or to prevent the Iraqi Government from establishing effective administration. Much of the violence is sectarian in nature, and involves indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Recent attacks have included more massive car bombs against ordinary rush hour commuters in Baghdad, horrific sectarian murders and a further bomb attack on the Shia shrine in Samarra whose partial destruction last year helped provoke the current spiral of violence. It is clear that the objective of many of these attacks is to provoke sectarian retaliation, generate further divisions in Iraqi society and undermine any prospect of a stable and prosperous future for the Iraqi people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">As Deputies are aware, US and Iraqi forces have launched a stepped-up security campaign, particularly in Baghdad and neighbouring provinces. The intention is to secure areas from armed militias and establish firm government control, which inevitably entails an increase in fighting in the short term. It will be some time before a clear judgment can be made as to whether these operations can achieve any lasting success. There are reports that cooperation by local leaders with the Iraqi Government has brought some improvement in security in Anbar Province, which includes most of western Iraq, but it remains to be seen if this can be sustained. Last week's terrible bomb attack in Baghdad, which took the lives of a number of the Sunni leaders involved in this effort, was a stark reminder of the dangers facing Iraqis working to end the violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">The situation in the northern, Kurdish area of the country has in general been more stable than elsewhere. The separate military campaign by the Turkish Army against the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, in South Eastern Turkey has raised serious concern about a possible spillover into Northern Iraq, where PKK units maintain bases close to the border. There have been frequent suggestions in recent months that the Turkish Army might launch an attack into Northern Iraq in order to destroy these bases. It is clear that such a move could result in a wider conflict in the Kurdish provinces of Iraq and contribute to further regional instability. So far, although low level clashes along the border have continued, there has been no substantial Turkish incursion. The EU and others have urged Turkey not to launch any such operation, a message which the Government fully endorse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">The Government has emphasised consistently that security operations in Iraq will only succeed in the longer term in the context of a broadly political approach, involving a process of political reconciliation between all communities within a unified Iraq. In particular, it remains essential to work creatively to engage the Sunni community in the political system, especially through the review of provisions of the democratically-approved Constitution for Iraq. It is very disappointing that the campaign of violence and the internal differences within and between the many parties in Iraq's national Government seem to have impeded the bold action the situation surely calls for.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">The only way forward for Iraq is through the establishment of shared institutions, the maintenance of the unity of the country and the development of a meaningful regional perspective. Recent meetings of Iraq and its neighbours in the region, and the launch by Iraq and the UN of the International Compact for Iraq, may be important steps in developing a regional approach to resolving this conflict, but it is critical that the pledges made be lived up to. There is a clear obligation on all parties regionally and internationally to co-operate to end this nightmare situation for the Iraqi people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">The principal concern of the Government and our EU partners remains the welfare of the Iraqi people. The EU has provided over €700 million in assistance for reconstruction since 2003. In January, the Government announced a further €3 million in assistance for the victims of the violence, in particular the large numbers who have been forced to flee their homes, and are internally displaced in Iraq or have become refugees abroad. This represents a substantial addition to the €7.9 million already provided by the Government for humanitarian assistance in Iraq. In March we also announced the allocation of a further €100,000 to support the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.</p>

            <p eId="para_1042">The seventeenth Plenary Meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) took place in Cape Town on 19-20 April 2007. The Plenary was preceded by a number of other meetings that week, including the NSG Consultative Group, an information exchange meeting and a meeting of licensing officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">The deliberations of the NSG are confidential. In general terms, however, these meetings focused on issues concerned with the core objective of the NSG, viz. to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the implementation, on a national basis, of export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related material, equipment and technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">It was of particular importance from Ireland's perspective to receive an update on developments in respect of the US-India deal on nuclear co-operation. This occurred not during the Plenary but during the preceding NSG Consultative Group. The US reported that there remained a number of difficulties in respect of the bilateral agreement currently under negotiation with India. Ireland, together with several other like-minded countries, took the opportunity to seek clarification, both on the current state of play of these bilateral negotiations, and on the likely nature of any future request for the NSG to take a decision on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">Negotiations between India and the US on the substance of their bilateral agreement also took place in Cape Town outside the framework of the NSG Plenary. Discussions have continued between the two sides in the period since then. Our understanding is that efforts to bridge the gaps have not so far proved successful and further discussions have been scheduled for mid-July in Washington.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">The discussions in Cape Town confirmed our current sense that the NSG will not be asked to take any decision in respect of nuclear co-operation with India until after the US-Indian bilateral agreement has been finalised and India has concluded a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Negotiations on the latter have not yet commenced, pending the conclusion of the bilateral agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The next NSG Plenary meeting is scheduled to take place in Germany in May 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 132, 159, 165 and 284 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">As Deputies will be aware, efforts in the US Senate to achieve comprehensive immigration reform were not successful in attracting the level of support necessary to ensure its progress at this time. This is undoubtedly a setback for the Irish undocumented and their families here in Ireland. I can assure the House of the Government's determination and resolve to continue to highlight the issue and to work to achieve a satisfactory outcome which will address the needs of our undocumented citizens. This is an issue of the utmost importance and priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">On the positive side, there is strong cross-party awareness on Capitol Hill of the Irish dimension to the undocumented issue. Our Ambassador in Washington is extremely active in highlighting our concerns, as are officials of our Consulates across the United States. The Taoiseach and I, and other members of the Oireachtas, have raised this issue on every occasion we met with key figures in the US Administration and on Capitol Hill, and have made known the Government's strong support for measures that would benefit our undocumented citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">Our sustained political contacts have been further strengthened by the mobilisation of the Irish community behind the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform — a highly effective organisation which we are pleased to support, including financially.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Deputies are aware that immigration reform is one of the most contentious and high profile political issues in the US. There are strong views on both sides of the argument not only in Congress and the State legislatures but also in business, the trade union movement and US society in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">On May 17th, a bipartisan coalition of US Senators, including Senator Kennedy, reached what has been characterised as a "grand compromise" on comprehensive immigration reform. Very regrettably however, it did not prove possible to move the bill to a final vote on that occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">Subsequently, President Bush went to the Congress on June 12th to meet with Republican Senators. Following that meeting, he announced his support for a $4.4 billion initiative on strengthening border security. The Democratic Leader in the Senate and his Republican counterpart then announced that the reform bill would be brought back to the Senate floor. On 26th June, the Senate voted to proceed with a debate on the bill. I welcomed this as an encouraging advance. However, securing the necessary bipartisan consensus to deliver on this complex and divisive matter always constituted a very considerable challenge, and unfortunately, as we now know, the compromise bill failed to attract sufficient support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">I want to express my thanks and appreciation again to President Bush, and to Senator Kennedy and the many other Senators and Members of the House of Representatives who sought to resolve this complex issue in a balanced and constructive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">I have asked our Ambassador in Washington for his urgent assessment and overview of the current situation. In the light of this, we will immediately conduct a further thorough review of how best to harness our efforts and resources to try to finally resolve this extremely complex issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">On Monday 25 June, I had the honour to meet with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the former Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town. Archbishop Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. He paid a warm tribute to Ireland's support in those years, and also to our continued support to South Africa since 1994, including through the Irish Aid programme. Archbishop Tutu's straightforward and at times outspoken approach to global human rights issues is widely admired.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">We had a very interesting and wide-ranging discussion. Archbishop Tutu has taken a broad interest in conflict resolution throughout the world, but especially in Africa. I briefed him on Ireland's particular focus on the tragic situation in Darfur. We discussed the current crisis in Zimbabwe, where African leadership is very much needed, and where South Africa has a particular role to play. We also spoke about South Africa's role in African more generally, and the potential for it to draw on its human rights heritage in using its influence. I thanked Archbishop Tutu for his unceasing efforts to encourage more active African leadership in relation to the crises on the continent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">We discussed some of the development challenges facing Africa, and in particular the fight against HIV/AIDS, in which the Archbishop has a particular interest and involvement through the Tutu Foundation. The Irish Government currently gives the highest priority to addressing the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. South Africa has one of the highest infection rates of any country in the world, and over 20% of Irish Aid's current South African programme is dedicated to supporting HIV/AIDS interventions. In 2006, Irish Aid provided funding of  €120,000 to the Tutu Foundation to support its work in this field. I informed the Archbishop of the Government's commitment to increase the Irish contribution to overseas development to reach the UN target of 0.7% of Gross National Income by 2012. We discussed the important contribution which Non-Governmental Organisations and the private sector can and do make to development in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">Archbishop Tutu raised a number of projects which he is currently pursuing. One of these is the proposed Desmond Tutu Centre for Peace, Reconciliation and Conflict Resolution in Cape Town. The Archbishop described the purpose of this planned centre as providing moral leadership on reconciliation, forgiveness and conflict resolution. Planning for the centre is currently at a preliminary stage. I informed him of Ireland's own plans in the field of conflict resolution through the establishment of a new Conflict Resolution Unit within my Department, which will build on the experience we already have in this field.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1081">I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 141 and 174 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The arrangements for the overflight and landing in Ireland of US military aircraft, and civilian aircraft used to transport troops, have been in place under successive Governments for some fifty years, and there has been no change in policy. Overflight and landing arrangements for US forces in respect of the Iraq conflict were approved by Dáil Éireann on 20 March 2003 after a lengthy debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The current use of Shannon airport by aircraft transporting US troops is in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions on Afghanistan and Iraq. In relation to Iraq, UN Security Council Resolutions 1511 and 1546 explicitly call on UN member States to assist the multinational force in Iraq. Subsequent Resolutions have annually renewed the mandate of the multinational force, noting also that they are there at the request of the Government of Iraq.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">Separate to this issue, the Government are completely opposed to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition, as were the previous Government. As the Programme for Government makes clear, we will ensure that all relevant legal instruments are used so that the practice of extraordinary rendition does not occur in this State in any form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Our concerns in relation to this matter have been made clear to the highest levels of the US Government, including by the Taoiseach to President Bush. The Government received specific assurances from the US authorities, confirmed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">A number of Garda investigations into allegations related to extraordinary rendition have taken place and have found that there is no evidence to support these allegations of illegal activity. I should emphasise that, where the Gardaí have suspicions about a particular aircraft, they have full powers to board and inspect that aircraft. The decision to search a particular aircraft, therefore, if and when warranted in accordance with law, is a matter for An Garda Síochána, and, as the Government have also repeatedly made clear, An Garda Síochána has the powers it needs to investigate all allegations of illegal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">I have had detailed correspondence with Dr Maurice Manning, the President of the Irish Human Rights Commission, on all issues related to extraordinary rendition. My officials expect to have further contact with Dr Manning on these matters shortly. I would also note that in their joint statement on extraordinary rendition of 27 June 2006, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists and the Association for the Prevention of Torture do not call for spot checks, but rather for the inspection of aircraft "where there are grounds for believing... [they are] being used to transport detainees". It has always been the Government's position that in such circumstances, An Garda Síochána should exercise their powers of entry and search of an aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The Programme for Government also notes that we will seek EU and international support to address deficiencies in aspects of the regulation of civil aviation under the 1944 Chicago Convention. In this regard, Ireland has already taken the lead at EU level in raising possible improvements to the regulation of civil aviation and we are in ongoing discussion with fellow-members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1090">There has not yet been a discussion of developments in Kazakhstan at political level in the EU but developments there are being followed closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">On 18 May the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved a series of constitutional changes, among them a provision that the President can be elected for more than two successive terms of five years. This would allow President Nazarbayev, who was re-elected for seven years in December 2005, to continue in office beyond 2012. It appears that other aspects of the constitutional reforms, in the areas of rule of law, more powers for parliament and a greater role for the regions, may have the potential to be positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">Early parliamentary elections have now been called for 18 August, following which the constitutional changes will come into effect. The quality of these elections, in terms of the OSCE standards for free and fair elections to which Kazakhstan has subscribed, will be important. Ireland will send observers to Kazakhstan to participate in the international election observation mission of the OSCE' s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">Embedding democracy is a protracted and difficult process requiring both political will and sustained commitment. Kazakhstan has yet to experience a democratic leadership succession and it is disappointing that it has acted in a manner which is likely to postpone further any possible change of leadership. When the Irish Ambassador in Moscow who is accredited to Kazakhstan raised the matter at high level in Astana, he was informed that the purpose was to ensure continuing stability in the country in the face of internal ethnic and other strains and to facilitate an orderly succession.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">Under the EU Strategy for Central Asia adopted by the June European Council, the EU seeks to develop a new partnership with the region and with each of the five countries of the region, (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Takikistan and Turkmenistan). Encouraging greater commitment in those countries to respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law will be an important dimension of the Strategy, to be advanced through dialogue, sharing of experience and technical cooperation. It is particularly important that progress in democratisation should come to be perceived in the region as enhancing stability rather than potentially threatening it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1096">As indicated to the House, most recently on 8 February 2007, the case for ratification of this Convention has been examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has lead responsibility on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">As previously indicated, the rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland's commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">The Convention referred to in the Deputy's question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of States, (20). The Convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 37 States have ratified it. No European Union Member State has as yet signed or ratified the Convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the Convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">There are no plans at present to sign or ratify the Convention. However, as with all outstanding ratifications of international human rights instruments, the position regarding the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families will be kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1102">The EU's position regarding the arms embargo on China was most recently set out in Council Conclusions of 11 December 2006, in which the Council reaffirmed its willingness to carry forward work towards lifting the arms embargo on the basis of the European Council Conclusions of December 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The 2004 Conclusions make clear that any decision should not lead to an increase in arms exports, neither in quantitative nor qualitative terms. Equally, Council stressed in this context the importance of work on the revision and strengthening of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and on the new instrument on measures pertaining to arms exports to post-embargo countries (the "toolbox"). This work has not yet reached an agreed conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The Government's position was set out by the Taoiseach during his visit to Beijing in January 2005, when he also explained the importance to Ireland and the EU of continued progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in China. We support the lifting of the embargo but we do not wish to see any increase in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The Government continues to examine this issue with our EU partners, in the context of our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. A decision to lift the embargo will require the unanimous approval of Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">As the EU works towards lifting the arms embargo, it has also engaged in a dialogue on the issue at senior official level with key partners, including the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">Negotiations on EU accession opened with Croatia and Turkey in October 2005. Since then an extensive screening process has been underway. This involves close scrutiny of the compatibility of Turkish and Croatian legislation with that of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">In all, there are 35 negotiating chapters which deal with a range of policy areas. After a chapter has been screened, the EU decides, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether or not the negotiations in that sector should proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">At the Intergovernmental Accession Conference in Brussels on 26th June, six further chapters were opened with Croatia. This means that a total of ten chapters are currently open with Croatia. Negotiations with Croatia on two further chapters have been concluded on a provisional basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The negotiations with Turkey have made somewhat less progress than those with Croatia. Two new chapters were opened with Turkey at last week's Intergovernmental Accession Conference. This means that three chapters are now open with Turkey. Although discussions took place during the German Presidency on opening a further chapter, the required agreement of all Member States could not be secured in advance of last week's Accession Conference. Benchmarks have been agreed for ten other chapters. These must be achieved before negotiations can begin in these particular areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">In November 2006, the European Commission published its annual enlargement report on Turkey. This included an assessment of Turkey's progress with regard to the Copenhagen criteria. In November 2006, the European Commission published its annual enlargement report on Turkey. This included an assessment of Turkey's progress with regard to the Copenhagen criteria. The Commission noted that Turkey's reforms had continued during 2006, but at a slower pace. Improvements are needed on freedom of expression, the rights of non-Muslim religious communities, women's rights, trade union rights and on civilian control of the military. Further progress in aligning its legislation with that of the Union is also required, for example in agriculture, taxation, state aid, and the free movement of goods, workers and capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">The negotiations are complicated by the fact that Turkey has not fulfilled its obligations under the Ankara Protocol which requires it to open its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus. On account of Turkey's failure to implement the Protocol, in December 2006 the Council of Ministers agreed that eight specific negotiating chapters cannot be opened, nor will any chapters be provisionally concluded until the Commission verifies that Turkey has fulfilled its commitments under the Ankara Protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">In addition to the above, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia became a candidate country in December 2005, but its negotiations have not yet commenced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1118">This is an idea which would impact upon a wide range of interested parties, including my Department. In the first instance, however, the funding of academic disciplines in Irish universities, broadly speaking, is a matter for the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">In April, I called for a national debate on Ireland's attitude to our Diaspora at a conference on the Diaspora which I hosted in Dublin Castle. The conference provided an opportunity to launch a review of our approach to our community across the globe and, where necessary, reshape our policies in this key area. A centre or a hub for migration studies was among the ideas raised. Participants included representatives of industry, academic bodies, State agencies and public officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The Economic and Social Research Institute has carried out research in the area of migration studies, with the focus on return and inward migration more than on Irish emigrants living abroad. Another expert body, the National Economic and Social Council, has also tasked academics to carry out research into the social and economic effects of return and inward migration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">The Irish Abroad Unit in my Department has commenced a series of meetings with the universities to examine ways in which their experience and resources might be utilised by the Government in developing our policy in this area. The Unit will also seek to draw up an audit of any relevant research or work on the diaspora which may have been carried out overseas, including in the United States and Australia. The situation can be further reviewed in light of this work. I would emphasise, however, that the absolute priority focus of the Unit is on the provision of support and services to our vulnerable citizens overseas, especially in Britain but also including the undocumented in the United States.</p>

            <p eId="para_1127">The Government are pleased with the outline of the Reform Treaty that was agreed at last month's European Council meeting. The Reform Treaty will amend the existing Treaties in various ways so as to create a more efficient and effective Union that can better serve Europe's future needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">Our principal objective going in to these negotiations was to retain the substance and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty that was agreed in June 2004. This objective was achieved in that the great bulk of the 2004 agreement will be incorporated in the Reform Treaty when it is finalised later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">In the wake of the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, it was necessary to make certain changes to what had been agreed in 2004. The changes decided on at the recent European Council included the dropping of the constitutional title and the removal of the reference to the EU flag and anthem, although these will, of course, continue to be widely used throughout the Union. Moreover, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been taken out of the Treaty, but will retain its legally-binding status. National Parliaments have been given an enhanced role in the Union's legislative process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">There will be an opt-in/opt-out arrangement for the UK in the field of criminal and police co-operation. We will need to decide in the coming months whether or not to join that arrangement. Although the double majority voting system will not come into use until 2014, the overall institutional package from the 2004 agreement has not been reopened. This was a key requirement of ours throughout these negotiations. Ireland also succeeded in getting agreement to include commitments on combating climate change in the new Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">At the European Council, it was also agreed to change the title of "Foreign Minister" to "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy". The role will encompass also the responsibilities of the current High Representative for CFSP. The new title is certainly more cumbersome than ‘Foreign Minister', but the role and function of the High Representative are unchanged. Our position in these negotiations was to minimise the changes to the previous draft Treaty and this has been achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The next step in the process is an Intergovernmental Conference to be convened under the Portuguese Presidency to look at the technical and legal aspects of the new Treaty. The IGC will commence work in late July and will, hopefully, conclude later this year. This will allow time for Member States to ratify the new Treaty prior to the European Parliament elections in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The European Council has shown once again that Member States can reconcile their differences and reach agreement even in the most difficult circumstances. The Reform Treaty will create a more effective Union to serve Europe's future needs. The agreement at the June European Council will enable us to put the Union's institutional debate behind us and to concentrate on delivering tangible benefits to our citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_1164">The Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants produced a major report which has provided us with a very valuable framework for our current and future activities in this area. The Report, as the Deputy is aware, contains wide-ranging and detailed recommendations which require sustained and phased implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">Activities currently in operation are giving effect to well over two thirds of the report's recommendations, and further significant progress is being made. Implementation requires on-going action from all partners, in Government and the voluntary sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">The establishment and operation of the Irish Abroad Unit within my Department has greatly assisted in strategically directing and driving progress on all areas identified by the Task Force. These advances are very warmly appreciated, and supported, by our communities abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">An essential positive development is the very substantial level of funding now made available. In 2007, the unprecedented amount of €15.165 million has been provided for emigrant services. This is 26% greater than last year, and 15-times greater than the allocation some years ago, and is a clear and positive indication of the Government's firm commitment to the welfare of our emigrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">We have increased our financial support very substantially to the voluntary agencies active in the areas identified as critical by the Task Force. A particular priority for the Government is the ongoing need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised citizens abroad such as our older community in Britain and our undocumented in the United States, as well as the provision of pre-departure services and assistance to emigrants who want to return to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">In April, I hosted a conference on Ireland's Attitude to our Diaspora. The Chairman of the Task Force, Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon, was the keynote speaker. The conference provided an opportunity, five years on from the publication of the Task Force Report, to launch a review of our approach to our community around the globe and, where necessary, to reshape our policies in this key area. I was particularly pleased that the diverse participation in the conference included a delegation from the United States Congress as well as representatives of industry, academic bodies, State agencies and public officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">Officers in the Irish Abroad Unit, and in our Embassies, maintain very close and interactive contact with the front-line organisations that support our community abroad. This helps to ensure that the voluntary sector has an effective channel of communication with the Government, and that everything possible gets done to advance the interests and well-being of our emigrant communities. In this way, we are ensuring that our response to identified needs has a very practical effect, and is developed and improved in the light of operational experience.</p>

            <p eId="para_1172">A key objective of our foreign policy in the years ahead is to enhance Ireland's role as a model UN partner. That reflects the value we place on the UN as the primary multilateral framework through which we give expression to the values and principles that underlie our foreign policy. The value we accord the United Nations is also reflected in our strong support for the UN reform agenda. We believe that the UN must reform to ensure that it reflects in its structure and operations the wishes and interests of its member states and that it carries out the vital mandates of peace and development as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">As the Deputy will be aware, the UN World Summit, held in 2005, agreed a balanced and extensive package of UN reforms. I contributed to the preparation of the Summit in my role as one of the Envoys appointed by Secretary-General Annan to support his recommendations for change, with a particular focus on EU and other European states. Since then I have continued to support the agenda for change. There has been progress in some areas, notably including the establishment of the Peace Building Commission, review of management and mandates and progress towards System Wide Coherence in the development area. Progress has been less satisfactory in other areas, notably Security Council reform and revitalisation of the General Assembly, though I am pleased that work continues on finding avenues for progress on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">Ireland continues to work with its EU partners and other member States on implementation of the Outcome Document of the UN World Summit which, in the context of a series of reports by the Secretary General, forms the reform agenda. The issue of UN reform is regularly discussed within the EU. At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council last December I discussed this issue with my colleagues and we agreed that the EU would continue to engage actively in constructive dialogue to advance all the reforms agreed at the UN World Summit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">Ireland will continue to press for further progress, while acknowledging that such progress ultimately depends on the political will of the membership as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_1177">Following the events in Karachi on 12 May, which resulted in the loss of life of over 40 Pakistanis, the political and security situation in Pakistan is calmer but the situation is likely to remain tense in the lead up to Presidential and legislative elections later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">As the Deputy will be aware, the recent outbreak of violence in Karachi occurred when supporters of the suspended Chief Justice, protesting his suspension, clashed with members of a Karachi-based political party, the MQM. The Chief Justice's appeal against his suspension is currently being heard by Pakistan's Supreme Court, which is expected to deliver its judgment next month. Up until then, and if the suspension is upheld, political tensions surrounding this issue are likely to remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">A number of other issues relating to the status of various political parties and their leaders are likely to give rise to additional political tensions in the months leading up to the elections. The issue of whether military rule can be replaced by a return to civilian government is also a matter of concern. According to the current Constitution, President Musharraf is required to step down as army chief by the end of the year, if he is to remain President. On a bilateral and EU basis, we have made clear our wish to see the military dissociated from the political process and a return to civil, fully democratic, elected government. It is our hope that all political leaders and parties will do all in their power to maintain order and calm among their followers in the pre-election period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">Other issues of concern in relation to the security situation include the activities of Taliban and Al Qaeda supporters and other extremist groups along the border with Afghanistan and in some of the tribal areas.</p>

Following initial hearings on 5 June and 27 June last, the extradition hearing has been adjourned until 22 August. The adjournments are to give the defence time to prepare their case. The person in question is currently on bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">I am aware of the concerns of British Irish Rights Watch regarding this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">For those EU Member States which previously allowed for a Governmental role in extradition proceedings, the EAW system alters this role by providing for direct co-operation between judicial authorities. In this case, the Warrant has been addressed to the Belfast Recorder's Court, which is required to determine whether or not to make the relevant order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The position is that there are provisions in place under this system to protect the fundamental rights of individuals including, therefore, in this case the person sought. It is, of course, for the legal representatives of the individual in question to raise arguments before the Courts concerning possible bars to the making of an EAW order, including health concerns. My officials are closely monitoring the case. However, as the case is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1189">The humanitarian situation in Iraq has continued to deteriorate with up to 2 million internally-displaced persons within Iraq and some 2 million seeking refuge outside the country, mostly in Syria and Jordan. Provision of basic services and people's access to services are being severely affected by the current conflict. Access to water and sanitation is limited and many are dependent on food aid. Mortality rates have increased due to the surge in violence but also due to lack of access to adequate health services. Significant numbers of the displaced people are women and children whose husbands or fathers had been killed in the conflict. They are a particularly vulnerable group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">The Government is committed to assisting the vulnerable population in Iraq. Between 2003 and 2006, Ireland made available €7.9 million in emergency and recovery assistance for Iraq. In January of this year, we made an additional pledge of €3 million of which €1.5 million has already been disbursed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">Our assistance is being targeted at agencies working with the growing number of families who have been forced by the violence to flee their homes. Irish Aid has supported the work of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and the Red Cross in the provision of services to those who have been displaced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">We will continue to play our part in alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people through trusted partner agencies including the UN, the Red Cross family and Non Government Organisations (NGOs).</p>

            <p eId="para_1194">Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which came into force in 1970, Review Conferences are held every five years and afford an opportunity to review the implementation of the Treaty in all its aspects. The last such Conference was in 2005 and the next will take place in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">As part of each review cycle, a series of preparatory meetings are also held and there will be a Preparatory Committee meeting in each of the three years leading up to 2010. The first of these has already taken place, in Vienna from 28 April to 9 May 2007. The second meeting will take place in Geneva from 28 April to 9 May 2008. No dates or venue have yet been agreed for the third Preparatory Committee meeting in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">At the Vienna meeting, Ireland had a high profile, playing an active role as co-ordinator of the New Agenda Coalition (NAC) and making two statements on behalf of the group, as well as submitting a NAC working paper on nuclear disarmament for consideration during the review cycle. Ireland also participated actively as a Member State of the European Union and as a member of the G10, a group based in Vienna which focuses mainly on issues related to compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. The EU and G10 also submitted several papers during the Preparatory Committee meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">While no negotiated outcome or substantive recommendations were required from the Preparatory Committee meeting in Vienna, it did provide an opportunity for a useful and constructive exchange of views across all three pillars of the NPT. Despite some initial difficulties in securing agreement on the agenda, discussions generally took place in a positive atmosphere and our assessment is that we helped lay important foundations for future work in this review cycle.</p>

            <p eId="para_1200">My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has lead responsibility in this area. His officials have had extensive consultations with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to the legislative changes that may be necessary prior to ratification of the Convention by Ireland. This examination has almost been completed and it can be concluded that about 90% of the provisions in the Convention are already provided for in Irish law and practice. The outstanding provisions, which arise in the criminal law area, will be dealt with through a combination of amending legislation and new statutory provisions, which I understand will be brought forward as soon as possible.</p>

The Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Berlin on 15-16 May, has allowed the EU to engage with China on such issues as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of religion and minority rights. The EU has used the Dialogue to press its case for Chinese ratification of such international instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and, in that context, reform of the criminal justice system. The EU has also urged China to continue co-operation with, and to implement the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including in particular the abolition of the "re-education through labour" system. The EU continues to use the Dialogue to raise significant individual human rights cases, including those relating to Falun Gong practitioners.

            <p eId="para_1221">Accession negotiations were opened with Croatia on 3 October 2005. Since then an extensive screening process has been underway. This involves examining the compatibility of Croatian legislation with EU law. In all, there are 35 negotiating chapters which deal with a range of policy areas.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1227">Much has been achieved in Liberia in both the political and humanitarian spheres since the 2003 Comprehensive Peace Agreement brought an end to 14 years of civil war. In particular, since the inauguration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf as Africa's first female President at the start of 2006, the Government has made significant progress in driving forward reforms and promoting economic recovery in very difficult circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The security situation remains fragile. Potentially destabilising factors include ex-combatants who have not benefited from the reintegration programme, individuals who feel their interests are threatened by the Government's reforms, and inter-ethnic land disputes in certain areas, particularly where returning refugees are reclaiming their property. Liberia also remains vulnerable to regional instability and could be affected negatively by any deterioration in the situation in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire or Sierra Leone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), in which an Irish contingent served from its establishment in 2003 until May 2007, plays a crucial role in ensuring sufficient security and stability to allow the Government to implement difficult reforms. The security situation improved significantly over the last four years, but Liberia's reformed police and armed forces will not be able to assume full responsibility for security until 2008 at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">The trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor for war crimes began in The Hague in June 2007 under the jurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In 2005-2006, Ireland provided €1.5 million to support the work of the court. Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission is also working to help the country come to terms with its bloody past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">The current Government has achieved much greater control of Government revenues but life remains very hard for most ordinary Liberians. Unemployment is a particular concern and President Johnson-Sirleaf has made addressing it a top priority. Other areas of focus include reform of the main private sector industries — forestry, iron ore and diamond extraction. Corruption is a major threat to stability, and the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Commission last year was a positive step. Earlier this year, corruption charges were brought against the former Chairman of the Transitional Government, Charles Bryant, and several former Ministers and deputy Ministers. However, as the Liberian Government is well aware, more remains to be done, especially with regard to corruption in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">The key role played by the Defence Forces during their time with UNMIL in support of stability in Liberia has been matched by support from Irish Aid for the country's development. In April 2007, the Secretaries General of the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs paid a joint visit to Liberia, together with the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. They met with President Johnson-Sirleaf, and assured her of Ireland's continuing commitment to supporting the Liberian people following the departure of the Irish contingent from UNMIL.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">Since April 2005, the Irish Aid office in neighbouring Sierra Leone has managed a special recovery programme in Liberia. The programme focuses on increasing stability and delivering improved services, especially in the area of primary health care. Funding of €5 million was initially approved for recovery activities in Liberia this year, but in view of the continuing scale of humanitarian needs in the country, this has been increased to €8 million. This increase was announced at an international donor conference on Liberia which took place in Washington in February 2007. It was warmly welcomed by the Government of Liberia, which is seeking strengthened donor input to assist in rebuilding the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">Ireland is continuing to explore ways in which we can provide meaningful and sustainable assistance to advance the democratic and peace processes in Liberia.</p>

            <p eId="para_1236">The issue of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula remains an important issue for the security and stability in the East Asia region, as well as for the wider international community. The DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear test last October was a direct contravention of the international objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">Ireland continues to support the efforts of the DPRK's neighbours to work constructively to find a diplomatic solution through the Six Party Talks process, involving China, the US, Japan, Russia, as well as North and South Korea. Important progress was made in these talks with agreement on 13 February on a series of measures, including most importantly that the DPRK seal its main reactor at Yongbyon within 60 days and allow the return of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors, in return for aid. Every element of the agreement must be fully implemented to further build the trust that will allow the success of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">I welcome the fact that IAEA inspectors have been invited back to the DPRK for talks to discuss the shutting down and sealing of the Yongbyon reactor in line with the February agreement, as well as the continued contacts between US and North Korean officials. The issue of the frozen North Korean funds at the Banco Delta Asia, following the bank's blacklisting by the US Treasury over allegations of its involvement in money-laundering and counterfeiting, appears to have been successfully resolved. The DPRK had made the return of these funds a condition for the implementation of its side of the February deal. This should no longer serve as an excuse for further delays. I trust that all sides will maintain the same commitment to the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues, including Japanese kidnapped by the North Koreans in the 1970s and 1980s, as future rounds of the talks proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">On the wider issue of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weaponry, Review Conferences of the NPT take place every five years and afford an opportunity to review the implementation of the treaty and all its provisions. The next scheduled NPT Review Conference will take place in 2010 and for which a series of preparatory meetings have begun this year. Regrettably, the last Review Conference, in May of 2005, ended without agreement on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. I have constantly made clear that the effective implementation of all aspects of the NPT, including the nuclear weapons states' commitment to disarmament, would serve to strengthen the global non-proliferation context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">The Battlegroup concept is designed to provide the European Union with the capacity to respond rapidly to emerging crisis situations, within the overall context of the European Union's security and defence policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">Battlegroups are designed to participate in time-limited missions of 30 days, extendable to a maximum of 120 days, by which time the operation would have concluded, or the Battlegroup been replaced by a larger force. Two Battlegroups have been on standby continuously since January of this year. Developments in relation to Battlegroups are reviewed regularly within the European Union, most recently by Defence Ministers on 14 May. Ireland's participation in the Nordic Battlegroup, which is scheduled to be on standby for the first six months of 2008, was approved by Dáil Éireann on 5 April this year, following earlier consideration by the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">Following Dáil approval, the Minister for Defence exchanged letters with his counterparts in Sweden, as Framework nation, and Norway, Finland and Estonia, notifying them of Ireland's acceptance of the Memorandum of Understanding governing participation in the Battlegroup. He also exchanged letters with the participants and the UK in relation to the use of the Northwood facility in England as Operational Headquarters for the Battlegroup.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">Ireland has offered a contingent of up to 100 members of the Defence Forces to the Nordic Battlegroup. The contingent comprises specialists in Explosive Ordnance and Improvised Explosive Device disposal, together with a protection detail. Ireland will also take up a number of posts in both the Force and Operational Headquarters. One officer has deployed to the Force Headquarters in Sweden where he is engaged in preplanning and training for the standby period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">Regular contact takes place between respective militaries, Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs on issues arising in relation to the Battlegroup. In May, the Minister for Defence, with his Nordic counterparts, took part in Sweden in an exercise designed to explore the political and policy decision-making procedures in the participating member States. Military training exercises involving all the participants in the Nordic Battlegroup are scheduled to take place in Sweden in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">It should be stressed that any deployment of the Battlegroup would be the result of a unanimous decision of the Council of the European Union.

More broadly, however, the continuing crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories underlines the absolute necessity of restoring a credible political process which holds out to the Israeli and the Palestinian people the realistic prospect of a just, peaceful and lasting negotiated settlement. I welcome the emphasis which Mr. Blair has placed on the need for urgent progress towards the achievement of a viable two-State solution.

            <p eId="para_1255">The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, announced at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York on 14 September 2005 that the Government will reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Official Development Assistance by 2012. We have agreed a number of steps along the way to achieving the target.  Firstly, we have an interim target of 0.5% of GNP in 2007. The 2007 Estimates allocations reflect this commitment.   Secondly, aid spending is expected to reach 0.6% in 2010. The Government has provided a total allocation of almost €730 million in Vote 29, International Cooperation, for 2007. This represents an increase of €131 million on the 2006 level of funding. A further €85 million has been allocated to overseas development through other Government Departments, bringing the total allocation in 2007 to almost €815 million. This allocation is the highest in the history of the programme and, as mentioned, meets the Government's interim target of spending 0.5% of GNP on Overseas Development Assistance. Over the coming years we will continue progress towards our next milestone target of reaching 0.6% of GNP by 2010. These steps emphasise our commitment to the developing world and ensure that we will continue to be one of the most generous donors on a per capita basis, when compared to our EU partners and other OECD countries. They also demonstrate that Ireland is well on track to fulfilling our commitment to meet the UN target of 0.7% by 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1258">I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 172 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The political, economic and human rights situation in Zimbabwe is a matter of very serious concern. Inflation is currently estimated at over 3700%, the highest in the world. Unemployment has risen to 80%. Life expectancy has virtually been halved in the past two decades, from 60 years to 33 years. Opposition activists, including Morgan Tsvangarai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), were seriously ill-treated in police detention in March 2007, and it is thought that many lower-profile activists are suffering similar treatment on an ongoing basis. Presidential and parliamentary elections are due to take place in March 2008, and the focus of international efforts must now be to ensure that there is a level playing field for these elections. This would allow the people of Zimbabwe to make the decision on who they think can best lead their country out of its current economic and political crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">Events in Zimbabwe were discussed at a Summit meeting of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Tanzania on 28-29 March. The SADC Summit gave President Mbeki of South Africa and President Kikwete of Tanzania a mandate to facilitate dialogue between the government and opposition in Zimbabwe. I welcome the fact that a number of meetings between the two sides have taken place during May and June, chaired by South Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">Ireland and the European Union support this initiative. We strongly believe that African leadership is the key to improving the situation in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's neighbours, who are themselves most affected by the overspill of the country's problems, are best placed to encourage progress towards stable economic and political development, and adherence to those human rights standards on which Africa seeks to base its future development. Ireland and the European Union will expect to see concrete progress from this initiative before too long, and I look forward to the outcome of the SADC Summit on 12 August in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">In April 2007, EU Foreign Ministers condemned the violent repression of the opposition the previous month; welcomed the SADC initiative; and urged a broad inclusive national dialogue, which is essential to lay the basis for genuine reform and national reconciliation. As a mark of the EU's concern, representative of the EU Presidency in each of the SADC countries expressed to their host governments the concern of the EU and its Member States about the developments in Zimbabwe in March. The EU has a targeted visa ban against Zimbabwean leaders, but does not have economic sanctions against the country. The EU is still a major provider of aid to the Zimbabwean people, and this commitment to their welfare will remain in spite of government actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Ireland is among those EU Member States which have most strongly condemned human rights abuses and urged political and economic reform in Zimbabwe. I made a public statement condemning the March 2007 violence, and I subsequently asked the Irish Ambassador in Pretoria to travel to Harare to convey our concerns directly to the Zimbabwean authorities. The Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe on an ongoing basis, and raises issues of concern with the Zimbabwean government at every available opportunity. The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs also raised Ireland's concerns with Zimbabwean officials during a visit to Harare in June and also encouraged full and active participation in the South African initiative. He also availed of the opportunity to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe with senior representatives of the MDC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">I am acutely conscious of the suffering caused by the dire economic situation in Zimbabwe, and of the need to provide support directly to the ordinary people there. In 2007, Irish Aid will allocate €3 million to local NGOs to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Zimbabwe, and a further €2 million to NGOs and civil society organisations involved in long-term development work in the country. Economic decline over the past decade and drought in 2006-7 have taken their toll, and a recent UN/WFP assessment has warned that two million Zimbabweans may face serious food shortages later this year, possibly rising to over 4 million people by early 2008. In response, Irish Aid has provided €2.4 million in emergency funding through UN organisations in Zimbabwe so far this year. Since 2005, Irish Aid has provided over €9 million in Emergency &amp; Recovery funding for Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">I am aware that a delegation of the Save Zimbabwe Coalition, including opposition leader Morgan Tsvangarai, visited Europe earlier this month. They had meetings in Brussels and London, and with the EU Presidency in Berlin. The delegation did not visit Dublin on this occasion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1269">The Government and our EU partners share the widespread international concern that Iran has still not complied with its international obligations in respect of its nuclear programme. On 23 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported for the third time that Iran had ignored the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its uranium enrichment programme, as set out most recently in Security Council Resolution 1747 of 24 March 2007. The Security Council is now considering what further measures might be adopted under the UN Charter in order to achieve Iran's compliance with its international obligations. The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council, which I attended in Luxembourg on 18 June, reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to finding a diplomatic solution which addresses these concerns. The Council also strongly supported the approach of the UN Security Council, and its determination to adopt further measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">Deputies will recall that the EU, in cooperation with China, Russia and the United States, has presented a generous set of proposals to Iran, emphasising the potential for greatly improved relations if Iran took clear action to address the issues which have raised concern about the nature of its nuclear programme. The offer from the EU included significant technology transfer to provide Iran with a modern civil nuclear capacity. It is regrettable that Iran does not appear so far to have given these wide-ranging proposals the serious consideration they deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The EU High Representative, Javier Solana, has remained in regular contact with Iranian negotiators, most recently through a meeting in Lisbon on 24 June. While the atmosphere of these discussions has been cordial and positive, they have not yet produced an indication of the serious engagement on the Iranian side which would allow substantive negotiations to commence. The Government strongly supports the continuing efforts of High Representative Solana. We will continue to encourage the Iranian authorities to engage constructively in discussions with him and to seize the opportunity available for a negotiated, diplomatic solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">The recent storms in Pakistan and India have severely affected some of the most vulnerable communities in the region. It is estimated that hundreds of people may have been killed and thousands have lost their homes as well as their livelihoods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">The worst-affected areas have been in and around Karachi.

Ireland provides substantial support to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) to build the capacity and response of national societies in emergencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">In the last twelve months, Ireland has provided €2m to the IFRC specifically to enable them to respond effectively to individual emergencies, such as the current one in Karachi. These funds are allocated on the basis of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">As the Deputy will be aware, the United Nations has a special Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), established with assistance from Ireland, to enable the UN humanitarian agencies to respond rapidly to emergencies.

            <p eId="para_1280">Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991. A Transitional Federal Government (TFG) representing a range of clans was established in Nairobi in 2004 with UN and EU support, but was unable to make a significant impact on the ground. Public discontent with over a decade of anarchy led to increased support for the United Islamic Courts (UIC) movement, which enforced sharia law in areas of southern Somalia from mid-2006. However, Islamic extremists gained influence within the UIC, and threatened a jihad against Ethiopia. In December 2006, a joint military operation by the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops led to the collapse of the UIC. In February 2007, the UN gave the African Union the mandate it had asked for to send a peace support force (AMISOM) to the country. The first AMISOM troops, from Uganda, were deployed in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The security situation in Somalia deteriorated in March, with clashes taking place between the Transitional Federal Government security forces on the one hand, and clan militias and Islamists on the other. Several hundred thousand people were displaced from Mogadishu as a result of this violence. There was an improvement in the security situation from late April, but urban conflict continues, including inter-clan violence. On 22 June, a curfew was imposed in Mogadishu in response to this violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">A planned National Reconciliation Congress (NRC) has been postponed until mid-July, to allow further time for preparations and for a necessary stabilisation of the security situation. The EU sees the Congress as an opportunity for the TFG to draw in new elements to increase its public support and credibility. There have been indications that some members of the United Islamic Courts may be invited to take part in the NRC. It will be in the TFG's interest to build its own legitimacy on a firmer foundation byinvolving as many actors as possible in the Congress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The EU is continuing to urge the TFG to talk to moderate Islamists, civil society, women, business people and clan leaders. The European Commission has been working closely with TFG officials, including giving practical training on ceasefires, and has provided initial funding of €2 million for the National Reconciliation Congress. EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Somalia in May 2007. We encouraged all parties to work towards a comprehensive ceasefire, emphasising that the conflict can only be settled by political means. We called for an inclusive, meaningful and consensual dialogue involving all sections of Somali society, and noted our readiness to support the National Reconciliation Congress, financially or otherwise. We welcomed contacts between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), Ethiopia and the Hawiye clan leadership committee. Finally, we reaffirmed the EU's support for the work of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">On humanitarian access, where Ireland has particular concerns, my EU colleagues and I reiterated the obligation of all parties to comply with international humanitarian law and urged the Somali authorities to do their utmost to remove any obstacle to the free movement of aid workers into and throughout the country</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">Ireland supports the EU position that in the absence of dialogue, a purely ‘security' approach to Somalia's problems is not likely to be effective. Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to Somalia, and we have given €4.88 million in humanitarian assistance so far in 2007. In addition to providing an early response to the UN's consolidated appeal for Somalia in February 2007, we are funding recovery and reconstruction activities by NGO partners, including Irish NGOs, in post-conflict areas of Somalia. Irish Aid responded to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people by fighting in Mogadishu in March and April with further funding to our partner agencies. In view of the fragility of the situation, I am continuing to keep the humanitarian situation in Somalia under close review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1288">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 176 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Some significant progress has been achieved in democratic reforms in Afghanistan, as well as in the administrative and justice systems, since 2001. With international assistance, the reform process is continuing across all sectors. The goal of the international community, in cooperation with the Afghan government, remains to extend legitimate government, the rule of law and the benefits of government to all parts of Afghanistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">At the same time, there is deep concern about the security situation in Afghanistan. Insurgent activity remains high, shifting from direct confrontation to greater use of improvised explosive devices, kidnappings and suicide attacks. Equally, the Taliban continue to seek to spread their influence, and the conflict, into new areas. Moreover, concerns remain regarding increased drug production, the need to tackle corruption, and the weakness of the rule of law and of Afghan institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has expanded to try and meet this threat. With some recent successes, ISAF believes that the insurgency can be contained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">Security and stability in Afghanistan cannot, of course, be achieved by military means alone. Long-term success depends on a comprehensive approach, encompassing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, raising living standards and improving governance and the rule of law. Recent ISAF operations have focussed on providing a security environment to facilitate reconstruction efforts and development. A further key challenge, not only for Afghanistan, but also for its neighbours and the wider international community, is the need to combat the narcotics trade from Afghanistan, which provides 92% of the world's heroin. In a further key challenge, not only for Afghanistan, but also for its neighbours and the wider international community, is the need to combat the narcotics trade from Afghanistan, which provides 92% of the world's heroin. Increased production presents a real danger, as it helps finance the insurgency and also fosters corruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">There is strong EU engagement with Afghanistan. The ESDP mission on policing for Afghanistan, which was approved by the Council last February, is continuing its preparations for work on the ground. The mission will improve coordination in the international community's efforts to assist police reform and capacity building. Bilaterally, Ireland has contributed more than €31 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan since 2000, covering areas such as reconstruction, drugs programmes, mine clearance, drought and flood relief, criminal law and criminal justice support. Seven members of the Irish Defence Forces currently serve in non-combat roles with ISAF, based in Kabul.</p>

It has been repeatedly raised with the Chinese authorities through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, including at the most recent round in Berlin on 15 May.  The EU made clear its deep concern over actions against defence lawyers advocating human rights and contesting abuses of power and corruption, and about the continued harassment of the family of the individual in question.  Ireland has also raised this case bilaterally with the Chinese authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">The issue to which the Deputy refers is one of considerable concern within the EU.  The harrowing scenes we have witnessed recently clearly demonstrate the need to make rapid progress in developing a comprehensive European migration policy.  This policy must take into account development issues, legal migration, integration, border control, readmission and the fight against illegal migration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">Ireland has consistently supported a strengthening of dialogue and cooperation on migration issues with other regions, including North and Sub-Saharan Africa.  The European Council, at its meeting in Brussels on 21-22 June 2007, underlined the importance of closer cooperation with third countries in managing migration flows.  There is an urgent need for specific partnerships with third countries aimed at developing a more coherent migration policy.  These partnerships need to combine measures aimed at facilitating legal migration opportunities — while respecting Member States' competences, including on the regularisation of status issue, and the specific needs of their labour markets — with measures designed to fight illegal migration, protect refugees and tackle the root causes of migration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">There is considerable sympathy for the plight of those who come to Europe in open boats at great risk to their lives.  This human tragedy is a further reason why development policies must play an important part in our response to illegal migration, and in helping to ensure that these extremely hazardous journeys, with their tragic consequences for many of those travelling, are no longer with us.  Specifically in relation to Malta, I am pleased to say that Ireland was one of five Member States who accepted a number of programme refugees who landed in Malta in the past 18 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">At the behest of the United Kingdom, a protocol on the Charter was introduced at a very late stage in the negotiations relating to its scope and application.  I considered it necessary and prudent to seek an opportunity to study the implications of the protocol.  While we continue to examine the technical implications, in our view, the text of the Charter itself and the wording to be included in the Treaty adequately define the scope and application of the Charter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1334">I would like to confirm that my Department is proceeding with the Decentralisation Programme as agreed by Government.  Following the announcement all necessary resources including staffing were made available in my Department to ensure the success implementation of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">It might be helpful if I was to give a brief update on the progress of the programme within my Department and within the agencies under the aegis of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">Department of Finance — The official opening of my Department's new offices in Tullamore took place on the 6th of October, 2006.  The new offices in the Central Business Park in Tullamore is a modern, state of the art building comprising of three floors, with a total floor area of approximately 3400 sq metres on a site of 2.8 acres.  My Department together with the Officer of Public Works (OPW) is currently examining possibilities for permanent accommodation in Kildare to accommodate circa 30 ICT posts, which will also be moved under the decentralisation programme.  Pending the identification of a suitable permanent accommodation solution, interim accommodation options in County Kildare are being examined, with a view to having an advance move commenced later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">Revenue Commissioners — As part of the decentralisation programme it is intended that Revenue will decentralise 50 posts to Newcastlewest, 50 posts to Kilrush, 50 posts to Listowel, 250 posts to Athy, 100 posts to Navan and 380 posts to Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">Newcastle West — The decentralising staff have moved to temporary accommodation in Estuary House, Limerick.  A site for the new decentralised offices in Newcastle West was purchased by the OPW from Limerick County Council in 2005.  A preferred tenderer has been chosen and planning permission has been obtained.  Revenue are ready to occupy the building in Newcastle West as soon as it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">Kilrush — Suitable accommodation has been identified by the OPW in Kilrush.  The networking, telephony installations and other preparations are all completed and once legal issues are resolved Revenue will be in a position to occupy the building immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">Listowel — The OPW have signed a lease for the premises in Listowel and the fit-out of these premises is underway.  After the formal handover of the building to OPW, Revenue will be in a position to complete their networking and telephony installations and the building will be furnished ready for occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">Athy — The OPW are in advanced negotiations for a premises in Athy that will accommodate an advance party of 75-80 Revenue staff.  The premises is expected to be available towards the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">Navan — A building has been identified in Navan to accommodate 100 staff of the Meath District Division of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is expected that the building will be ready for occupation by Revenue by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">Kildare — One hundred and sixteen (116) people have indicated an interest in decentralising to Kildare with Revenue.  The Office of Public Works are in the process of identifying a suitable location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Office of Public Works — As part of the decentralisation programme it is intended that OPW will decentralise 330 posts to Trim (future OPW HQ); 150 posts to Claremorris and 100 posts to Kanturk.  To date four hundred and two (402) staff have applied for places in Trim under the CAF process, one hundred and eighty five (185) staff have applied for places in Claremorris and one hundred (100) staff  applied for places in Kanturk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">The OPW has acquired the site in Trim and the Contractor/Developer will move on site shortly.   The current target for completion of the Trim project is Q4 2008.  It is proposed to manage the move to Claremorris in two phases.  The first phase deals with the setting up of an advance office for up to forty (40) staff in Claremorris, where OPW has identified suitable accommodation.  It is expected that the accommodation will be ready for occupation in late August 2007.  The second phase of this project will be the construction of a permanent office for up to one hundred and fifty (150) staff.  A site has been acquired and the indicative timeframe for the completion of the construction is early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Acquisition of a suitable site in Kanturk is well advanced and the indicative timeframe at this stage for the completion of the construction of the Kanturk office is the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">Valuation Office and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to Youghal, Co. Cork — As part of the overall decentralisation programme, it is intended that 100 posts of the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and 100 posts of the Valuation Office will decentralised to Youghal, Co. Cork.  I am informed by PAS and the Valuation Office that the number of people who have indicated their desire to decentralise to Youghal with these offices is 100 and 28 respectively.  In accordance with the indicative timescale set out in the report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group both offices are working towards decentralising to Youghal in mid 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">While neither the Valuation Office or PAS are on the early-movers list, the Office of Public Works (OPW) have agreed terms to acquire a local authority site in Youghal from Cork County Council.  The legal formalities are being pursued by the Chief State Solicitors Office in consultation with Cork County Council's legal team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) to Dungarvan, Co. Waterford — The OSI will decentralise 200 of its Dublin based Headquarters posts to Dungarvan.  The OSI has a presence in six regional offices where a further 100 staff are located in: Kilkenny, Cork, Ennis, Tuam, Sligo and Longford.  These offices will not be relocating to Dungarvan. Applications to decentralise with OSI have been made by forty nine (49) civil and public servants as well as sixteen (16) existing OSI staff based in Dublin.  In addition, sixty three (63 OSI staff have been assigned to Dungarvan as a result of recruitment or promotions under the decentralisation programme since its commencement in December 2003.  Arrangements for decentralisation are proceeding in accordance with the OSI implementation plan and a site has been acquired in Dungarvan by the Office of Public Works (OPW).</p>

The scheme of capital allowances came into effect in May 2002.

            <p eId="para_1352">To be a qualifying hospital, a private hospital must meet certain capacity requirements.  It must have an operating theatre or theatres and related diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and must be able to provide a range of specified services.

Capital expenditure incurred on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a private hospital may be written off over seven years at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years and 10% in year 7.</p>

            <p eId="para_1365">Foster care payments are exempt by virtue of section 192B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This measure was introduced by section 11 of the Finance Act 2005. Children in foster care are in the care of the State under the Child Care Act 1991.  Foster carers undertake to care for foster children on the State's behalf and as such are a unique group in unique circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">However, I would also point out to the Deputy that Budget 2006 introduced a scheme, which is provided for in the Finance Act 2006, whereby a person who provides childcare services for up to three children who are not their own in their own home could earn up to €10,000 per annum from the minding activity free of income tax.  This amount was increased to €15,000 per annum in Budget and Finance Bill 2007.  "Childcare services" are defined as "any form of childminding services or supervised activities to care for minors, whether or not provided on a regular basis".</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">This scheme of tax relief for childminders is likely to be of benefit to host carer families in respect of care provided for children with disabilities. In fact, the enabling legislative provisions for this in the Finance Act 2006 were designed having regard, among other things, to the type of care provided by host carers as mentioned by the Deputy. To the extent that payments are received by host families in respect of care for adults with disabilities, such payments are not currently subject to an income tax exemption.</p>

            <p eId="para_1413">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 17 of the Finance Act 2003 introduced new repayment provisions whereby a claim for repayment must be made within four years from the end of the period to which the claim relates.  This four year time limit came into effect on 1 January 2005 where a claim is made on or after 1 January 2005 the overall time limit is reduced to four years.  The change to the repayment deadline was announced in the budget speech in December 2002 and the measure received an amount of publicity at that time.  Reminders of the change were advertised by Revenue in the national press in October and November 2004 and there was also considerable media comment about the change around that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">In the case referred to by the Deputy, repayment claims in respect of the years 1997/98, 1999/00, 2000/01, 2001 and 2002 were submitted on 14 February 2007.  Unfortunately, these claims cannot be processed as they were filed outside the statutory time limit. A repayment claim in respect of medical expenses for 2003 has been received within the time limit and will be processed without delay.  Medical expenses have already been allowed for 2004 on foot of the taxpayer's tax return for that year and, likewise, any further claims in respect of 2005 or 2006 can be processed in conjunction with the taxpayer's returns for those years.</p>

However, the community support beds project was not included by the HSE in the proposed developments for advancement in 2007.

            <p eId="para_1460">The rate of repayment is lower than had been projected.

            <p eId="para_1461">In accordance with the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, priority has been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected.  However, repayments to estates have now commenced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1465">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For Medical Card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1475">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of €575 million for the 5 year period of 2006-2010.  This Programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the EOCP and incorporates among its key objectives: increasing the supply and improving the quality of early childhood care and education services.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool and other pre-school places, school age childcare including "wrap around" childcare places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Eligibility for capital grant funding under the NCIP is assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant's capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  To comply with the criteria, services, including playschool and other pre-school services, are expected to operate for minimum periods per day.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare and community-based projects are expected to demonstrate a focus on disadvantage.  The maximum capital grants available under the scheme for the building or expansion of childcare facilities are €1.2 million per facility for community-based not for profit providers and €100,000 per facility for private providers (subject to a maximum of 75% of the total cost) and a maximum of €500,000 for multiple services in different catchment areas.  In addition, a small grant scheme is available for Parent and Toddler Groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">Following a review of the operation of the Programme to date, and in the context of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP, revised guidelines for the assessment of capital applications were introduced in April this year.  These include provision for grant funding of up to €5,000 per additional place for short-time sessional playgroups and similar services which do not meet the minimum operating periods required under the main grant schemes.  Subject to the programme criteria, grant aid is also available to assist in the renovation and equipment of existing services, including playschools.  To apply for NCIP funding applicants should contact their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) who will provide advice and assistance in the completion of applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_1486">The report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care was published in October 2001.  The Report made a number of recommendations for the future development of palliative care services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">The Department, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the voluntary sector are actively involved in planning for the development of palliative care services in line with the recommendations of the report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (2001).</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Funding is being provided for the development of such services on an incremental basis in line with the recommendations in the report and in the context of available resources and workforce planning across the health service.  A Baseline Study (launched March 2006) was undertaken by the Irish Hospice Foundation, supported by the Health Service Executive and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  The Study tracks services on a regional basis against the recommendations of the Report of the National Advisory Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">The Baseline Study indicated that there are regional variances across the country in the provision of hospice/specialist palliative care services. The Department is committed to working with the HSE and other key stakeholders to address the issues raised in the Baseline Study and to develop palliative care services throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">Additional funding of €13 million (€9m in 2006, €4m in 2007) was provided by the Government for palliative care in Budget 2006.  A further €5 million is being allocated under Budget 2007 to develop services.  This funding is being used to improve palliative care services in consultation with the newly established HSE Regional Development Committees and in line with the recommendations made in the report of the National Advisory Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">As outlined in Towards 2016, the Government is committed to further developing palliative care throughout Ireland with particular reference to the Baseline Study on the provision of Hospice/Specialist Palliative Care Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">In 2007, the Department will be working with the HSE on developing a paediatric palliative care policy in line with the Report.  The HSE, which is now charged with the operational responsibility for delivery of healthcare services, is also committed to a number of further initiatives this year including rolling out the Minimum Data-Set for Palliative Care Services and agreeing a framework for National Standards for Palliative Care with the relevant stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_1503">The health repayment scheme was launched in August 2006 and is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">The position at 15th June, 2007 was that 3,200 offers of repayment, with a value of approximately €60m have been issued by the scheme administrator. Arising from these offers approximately 1,800 repayments with a value of approximately €38m have been made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">This rate of repayment is lower than had been projected. I understand from the HSE that this is due to a number of factors including the legal and technical requirements, a high level of deficiencies in the application forms submitted to the scheme administrator and complexities in the operation of the probate process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">In accordance with the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, priority has been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected.  However, the repayments to estates has now commenced.  In relation to elderly widows or widowers of deceased persons and the priority that should be given to their claims, the HSE has put additional resources in place to encourage both the completion of application forms for clients in vulnerable client groups and to ensure these claims (in particular where there is an elderly spouse who could benefit) are processed as quickly as possible.  The timeframe for the processing of these applications will depend on the individual circumstances pertaining to each application.  Some applications will take longer to progress than others depending on the complexity of the application, the amount of information provided on the application form and the availability of records for the relevant periods of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">A dedicated website www.repay.ie, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 pm Monday to Friday.  The helpline has dealt with 50,161 queries to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">The HSE is monitoring the operation of the repayment scheme and has agreed a range of initiatives with the scheme administrator to speed up the repayment process. The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and I have been informed by the HSE that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1554">"To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The CAHR was comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning medical, scientific, social and legal domains. This expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">The Commission published its report in May 2005. Its report was the first step in determining a policy response to AHR and it made 40 recommendations on AHR services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">The Government decided to refer the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children so that the Committee could consider and report in due course on its views of the recommendations of the Commission. The Committee was considered an appropriate forum in which to subject the report to structured democratic and political analysis and scrutiny.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">In the meantime, cognisant of the amount of work required, I have instructed my Department to begin work on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.  As part of the analysis of the complex issues involved in Assisted Human Reproduction, the views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, along with any judgement of the Supreme Court in the RvR Frozen Embryo case will be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1586">The Railway Procurement Agency has been mandated by the Government to procure and implement Metro North. The RPA continues to engage extensively with residents in the area (including Residents for Realignment) in exploring mechanisms for addressing their concerns.  Any meeting to be held on these issues is a matter for the RPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Following a very extensive public consultation process last year, the RPA Board decided on the preferred route for Metro North and it was announced in October 2006.   Metro North will have 15 stops, including ones at Griffith Avenue and Drumcondra.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">Work is at present underway on the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement and the documentation required to support an application to An Bord Pleanála for a Railway Order. A Railway Order is the legal permission needed to build and operate Metro North. The authority to make a final decision on the alignment of Metro North rests with An Bord Pleanála, through this Railway Order process. The terms of this statutory planning process also allow considerable opportunity for the public to comment on, and indeed object to the detailed plans for the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">The RPA continues to engage extensively with residents in the area in exploring mechanisms for addressing their concerns and to this end has written on a number of occasions to all householders whose properties are located close to the proposed tunnel alignment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">The RPA has received many, and sometimes irreconcilable requests, from residents relating to the tunnel alignment. As a result, RPA is considering a number of options for an alternative tunnel alignment between the Drumcondra and DCU stop locations, which would potentially help to address the residents concerns. However, it also has to have regard to construction, cost and operational issues when looking at alternatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">It is also important to note that solving one person's problem may only create a problem for somebody else and that whichever route is chosen will pass beneath houses, businesses and other buildings. The views of other communities and stakeholders along the full Metro North line who are supportive of the project moving ahead as soon as possible also needs to be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">When the options for alternative alignments have been further developed, RPA will write to all affected residents again enclosing details of the options and seeking comments on them.  These comments will feed into the overall environmental assessment of the options so that the detailed tunnel alignment for this portion of Metro North can be finalised and the project can be moved towards construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">RPA will also ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to address any potential damage to property caused by tunnelling. The RPA have informed me that modern tunnel construction methods make it unlikely that any structural damage will occur.  Finally, the RPA has agreed to provide funding for independent technical advice for residents who may be affected by tunnelling works along the route, subject to agreement on the detailed arrangements for this. It is important that the residents' representatives engage directly with the RPA to agree these arrangements, which must also respect public financial and procurement requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1595">The default speed limit that applies under the Road Traffic Act 2004 to a national road such as the N63 route is 100 km/h.   Power to apply a lower special speed limit of 80, 60 or 50 km/h in lieu of that statutory default speed limit at any location on the N63 route is vested in the elected members of Galway county council through the making of special speed limit by-laws under section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">The exercise of that power to revise a speed limit is subject to consultation with the Garda Síochána and, in the case of a national road, to obtaining the consent of the National Roads Authority.  In addition to the power to apply a special speed limit that applies on a 24-hour basis all year round as is the standard practice, the 2004 Act introduced a more flexible policy whereby the county council can apply a special periodic speed limit to operate during specific periods of the day such as for example, on a road in the vicinity of a school premises during the periods of time that school children are entering or leaving school. In late 2005 I prescribed, as an alternative to standard speed limit signs, an electronic format of a regulatory periodic speed limit sign for use in such circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">The decision as to whether or not to deploy a school warden service at any particular location to stop traffic and enable schoolchildren to cross the public road in safety, is a matter for the local authority subject to the consent of the Garda Síochána. The engagement of a school warden service is a function reserved to the elected members of the council under section 96 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  The selection of the speed control measure or a combination of measures that would be optimum to address road safety needs at any location is a matter to be identified and determined at local level in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority.</p>

Within the context of Transport 21, a far wider integrated ticketing scheme is to be in place within the Greater Dublin Area, based on smartcard technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">An Integrated Ticketing Project Board was established last year to take forward this project, comprising the Chief Executive Officers of the RPA and CIE companies, a representative of private bus operators and a senior official from my Department under an independent chairperson.  The Project Board was given the responsibility of delivering the smartcard technology required to deliver an integrated smart card ticketing system within an agreed specification, timeline and budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">The Board has submitted a comprehensive proposal for the delivery of the project.  The proposal puts the expected capital cost of the integrated ticketing system at €49.6 million.   On the 1st June, my Department wrote to the Chairman of the Project Board authorising him to proceed with the implementation of the project along the lines proposed by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">The Chairman has since informed me that the procurement process to secure a supplier for the back office systems is underway. The tender notice was recently placed in the Official Journal of the European Union.  Currently, smartcard ticketing systems are in place on both Luas and Mortons services. Both Iarnrod Eireann and Dublin Bus also intend to introduce their own interim smartcard systems in the near term. These will enable both users and operators to familiarise themselves with the use and flexibility of smartcard systems.  The next stage then is to roll-out the proposed integrated ticketing system within the Greater Dublin Area. All of the current smartcard schemes are designed to migrate to this integrated smartcard system at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">This roll-out will commence within 27 months on the services of Dublin Bus, Luas and Morton's. It will be extended to Iarnrod Eireann Dart and Commuter rail services within the following year. Bus Eireann has agreed to commence a trial project on one of its commuter routes.  Full roll-out will be completed within four years.  The Board also confirmed to me that a range of multi operator products will be available on all smart cards. In addition, an electronic purse similar to "pay as you go" for mobile phones will also be available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1740">The Common Position was most recently reviewed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June 2007, at which I participated. The Council's Conclusions deplored the fact that the human rights situation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, and noted that the Cuban Government continues to deny its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms. The Council's Conclusions recognised the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">While the European Union will continue to pursue its dialogue with Cuba's civil society and to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all areas of mutual interest. In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">I support the balanced approach adopted in the Council's Conclusions, which is in accordance with the principles of the Common Position. And I welcome, in particular, the decision taken to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels in the interest of establishing an open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities.</p>

The Thessaloniki Summit also confirmed the Stabilisation and Association process as the framework for further integration of the countries of the Western Balkans, preparatory in each case to a future accession process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">In October 2005, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia. These negotiations were subsequently suspended between 3 May 2006 and 13 June 2007 due to Serbia's failure to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY). At the GAERC meeting of 18 June last, EU Foreign Ministers welcomed a renewed commitment on the part of Serbia to cooperate with ICTY — as evidenced by the arrest of two ICTY indictees — and endorsed the Commission's decision to reopen SAA negotiations. The pace and conclusion of these negotiations will depend in particular on Serbia's progress in developing the necessary legislative framework and administrative capacity to implement its obligations under the Agreement, and on full co-operation with ICTY.</p>

            <p eId="para_1754">It is disappointing that the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland found that there is insufficient evidence at this time for further prosecutions arising out of the third Stevens report into alleged collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">The announcement that there will be no further prosecutions does not address the serious underlying issues arising from the murder of Pat Finucane in 1989, or allay the widely-held concerns regarding this case. Indeed, the findings only add weight to the family's case for a full and independent inquiry into the murder. This remains the Government's position.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1759">Increasing efforts are being made to tackle the problem of debt owed by developing countries to the International Financial Institutions, in particular the World Bank, African Development Bank and IMF. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was introduced in 1996 and strengthened and enhanced in 1999. It sought the reduction of the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but did not entail cancellation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July last year, goes further. It is a commitment to the cancellation of the multilateral debt owed, again to the International Financial Institutions, of many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the world. Most of these countries are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries acknowledged that many poor countries need 100% debt relief if they are to address the development needs of their people seriously. This is an important basis from which we can continue to work, using either or both of the two initiatives above, for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">The MDRI, though it is as stated above separate from the HIPC Initiative, is linked to it operationally. To qualify for HIPC debt relief, a country must establish a track record of reform and sound policies. Under the MDRI, cancellation of eligible debts to the World Bank is granted to countries which have completed the HIPC Initiative process, i.e. have already been judged as qualified to receive debt relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">As of April 2007, 30 countries of the 40 defined heavily indebted poor countries had received debt relief from the World Bank and IMF under the HIPC Initiative, amounting to US$41.9 billion. Twenty-two of these countries have also received MDRI debt relief from the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank amounting to a further US$19.3 billion. The IMF has also granted debt relief to two non-HIPCs (Cambodia and Tajikistan) with very low per capita income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">It should be stressed that, while both the HIPC and MDRI agreements relate to multilateral debt owed to the International Financial Institutions, considerable amounts of bilateral debt — which are not subject to these agreements — have also been cancelled by creditor countries in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">Ireland has been strongly supportive of the full implementation of debt relief and, where appropriate, cancellation. In addition to an earlier contribution of €30m towards the costs of implementation of the HIPC Initiative, we were the first country to pay its full share of the costs of the MDRI — €58.6m out of the approximately US$37 billion total cost. We will remain actively engaged in ensuring that international commitments to dealing with the debt burden on developing countries are met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1766">The situation in the ecologically and politically fragile region of the Horn of Africa is a high priority for Ireland, the EU and the United Nations. The problems faced by the countries of the region include the ongoing conflicts in Darfur and Somalia; a prolonged stalemate in the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace process; and the need to rebuild southern Sudan following decades of civil war. At a regional level, there are major development challenges such as recurrent food security problems, environmental degradation, severe infrastructural weaknesses and poor governance. These issues are being addressed through a combination of political initiatives, peace-keeping operations, and emergency, humanitarian and development assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">The UN Security Council regularly discusses Horn of Africa issues, and the UN Secretary General has described the crisis in Darfur as his top priority. UN agencies such as UNICEF, WFP, UNHCR and UNDP are working to address the humanitarian and development needs of the region. There are currently two UN peacekeeping missions in the Horn of Africa — UNMEE on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border and UNMIS in Sudan. The UN and African Union are working together to try to get negotiations started between the parties to the Darfur Peace Agreement and non-signatory rebel groups. Meanwhile, there have been encouraging indications that Sudan may accept the deployment of a UN-AU hybrid force in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">I have set out the situations regarding Sudan and Somalia in some detail in my replies to PQs numbers 86, 90 and 164.  The EU is one of the Witnesses of the 2000 Algiers Peace Agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The European Commission's October 2006 Communication on ‘EU partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa' sets out a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention in the region. In 2004, the last year for which there are complete figures, total European Commission development aid to the six Horn of Africa countries amounted to over €240 million. The European Commission intends to make over €60 million available for security, reconciliation and governance in Somalia in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Addressing the problems of the Horn of Africa, and especially in Darfur, is a priority for me personally. I travelled to Sudan and to Ethiopia in July 2006 to see the situation on the ground for myself. In my contacts with the Sudanese Foreign Minister then, and again in September 2006, I highlighted the need for meaningful action to bring peace and security to Darfur, and to protect the delivery of humanitarian aid to the vulnerable. In recent contacts with Egypt, South Africa, the Arab League, the UN and the US, I have urged them to use their influence with the Sudanese Government for the same purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">Ireland also supports the development of the Horn of Africa region through our aid programme. Ethiopia is one of Irish Aid's priority countries, and Irish bilateral aid to Ethiopia was about €30 million in 2006, focused at improving the lives of the rural poor. Total Irish Aid emergency and humanitarian funding to the Horn of Africa since 2004 comes to nearly €48 million. This includes over €20 million for Darfur.</p>

            <p eId="para_1773">HIV/AIDS continues to be the single biggest obstacle to reducing poverty and to attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Current statistics from the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) indicate that, in 2006, almost 40 million people were living with the HIV virus. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the worst-affected region in the world and is now home to over 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Infection rates are increasing in other regions also, with some countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia recording the highest rates of new infections worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The HIV/AIDS pandemic is impeding development and leading to an increase in poverty. It generally affects the most productive and economically-active members of society and serves to further disadvantage those people most vulnerable to infection — such as migrant workers, women and adolescents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">Responding to the global problem of HIV/AIDS is a key priority for the Government. This commitment is very clearly outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid, which was published last September. Following the commitment made by the Taoiseach in his speech to the United Nations in September 2005, funding for HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases has doubled to over €100 million in 2007. These funds are directed at programmes at international, regional and country level, to provide increased access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS, earlier this year confirmed that Ireland is one of the leaders in the global response to HIV/AIDS. He commended, in particular, Ireland's leadership in tackling HIV-related stigma and discrimination through the ‘Stamp out Stigma Campaign' which was launched by the Taoiseach on World AIDS Day, December 1st 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">Ireland continues to promote the need for leadership and engagement at the highest political level internationally, in order to reverse the trend of this pandemic. Ireland is leading by example in strongly supporting global efforts to address HIV/AIDS and its impact. Ireland's support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) is one such example, with contributions over the period 2002-2007 amounting to €80 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">Significant achievements are being made though the programmes of the Global Fund with over 700,000 men, women and children now accessing HIV treatment and many more people having access to essential HIV prevention and care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">Earlier this year, Ireland signed a new cooperation agreement with UNAIDS. Under the terms of this agreement, Ireland will commit €30 million over the next five years and cooperate with UNAIDS in strengthening global leadership and improving the effectiveness of comprehensive HIV programmes at country level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">In countries such as Tanzania, Ethiopia and Zambia, Ireland works with governments and non governmental organisations (NGOs) to strengthen national responses and improve access to essential HIV services. In Mozambique and Lesotho, and in partnership with the Clinton Foundation, Ireland has increased levels of assistance to improve the accessibility of HIV treatment in rural areas — in particular to benefit women and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV/AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels, and improved coordination of resources for effective HIV/AIDS prevention and control.</p>

            <p eId="para_1783">EU- Russia relations have entered a difficult period. There are disputes between Russia and a number of EU Member States, specifically the UK, Poland and the Baltic States. A series of incidents, most notably the murders of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London, have raised concerns about developments in Russia. In a number of important respects, notably media freedoms and space for dissent, the human rights situation appears to be deteriorating.  It has not been possible to reach consensus on a negotiating mandate for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Russia is nevertheless an indispensable partner for the European Union, not just in the economic field where there is a growing interdependence but, importantly, in relation to countries in the region which are now our common neighbours, and at the international level where the EU and Russia are able to work together constructively on issues such as the Middle East, Iran and North Korea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Ireland fully shares the concern at EU level both at the difficult state of EU- Russia relations and at the developments which have contributed to it. The extent to which the EU can expect to influence trends in Russia, and the implications this has for EU- Russia relations, is a recurring topic in discussions with my EU colleagues. For my part, I see significant challenges in the relationship but I agree that the EU must continue to work to improve it. As happened under the recent Finnish and German Presidencies, the Union at all levels has to devote ongoing attention to Russia and to work steadily on improving relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">In relative terms, Ireland's bilateral relationship with Russia is, for geographical and historical reasons, quite modest and our role in internal EU debate reflects this. Nevertheless, within the EU I personally, and my officials, have worked to support a balanced approach which takes account of areas both of agreement and of disagreement with Russia. We have also strongly argued for EU solidarity and cohesion.</p>

Along with our EU partners, we undertake regular reviews of ESDP missions and capabilities, including at the European Council last month, and at the joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">Members of the Defence Forces are currently participating in ESDP missions in Bosnia Herzegovina and in support to the African Union mission in Sudan. Defence Forces personnel have recently served with the EU missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (in support of the UN), and in Aceh (overseeing the peace and disarmament process there). Members of an Garda Síochána are currently serving with the EU Police Mission in Bosnia Herzegovina.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">In addition, Ireland is making a contingent of up to 100 members of the Defence Forces available to the Nordic EU Battlegroup, which will be on standby for crisis management missions requiring rapid deployment, for the first six months of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">Overall deployments of Defence Forces personnel on overseas UN-authorised missions — whether UN-, EU-, or Nato-led — are kept under constant review within the context of the overall commitment of up to 850 personnel on overseas duties at any given time, as specified in the White Paper on Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">The Government also keeps under review the numbers of Gardaí who are serving in overseas civilian missions. In this regard, the question of a Garda contribution to the expected EU rule of law mission to Kosovo is under active consideration.</p>

         the African countries wherein it is alleged that the most serious human rights abuses are taking place; the steps he has taken or proposes to take through the UN or EU with a view of addressing these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1793">Unfortunately, no part of the world is totally free from human rights abuses. As has been made clear on previous occasions, it is not the policy of the government to draw up any kind of "league table" of countries deemed guilty of the worst human rights abuses. Ireland closely monitors developments in the human rights situation throughout the world and where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns to the Governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">The risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak. Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and Africa lies at the heart of Ireland's development co-operation programme. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including by strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">The link between security and human rights protection is a key concern in many parts of Africa. Where state authorities do not exist, or do not have the will or capacity to enforce the rule of law, people are extremely vulnerable to serious human rights violations, with little prospect of redress. Some of our most serious human rights concerns relate to countries which are currently suffering from conflict, or which have recently emerged from conflict, such as Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sustained efforts are required to restore the kind of stability within which human rights can be protected. Ireland supports the work of the UN Peacebuilding Commission in this regard, as well as the considerable efforts of the European Union. On a national basis, Ireland also promotes security and stability in Africa through our support for development cooperation and through our participation in peacekeeping, most recently as part of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) from 2003-2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">The EU, in its political dialogue with African countries under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, regularly raises issues which arise in the development of democracy and the need for protection and promotion of human rights. The EU also pursues human rights issues when appropriate through the UN General Assembly and UN Human Rights Council. Ireland is fully associated with EU statements on human rights in these bodies. We actively supported the UN Human Rights Council's consensus resolution on Darfur, which was adopted in March 2007. Ireland and the EU have also made statements of concern about Zimbabwe at the Human Rights Council this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means to combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations in relation to four situations, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, northern Uganda, the Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">In addition to the United Nations and European Union, the African Union also has an important and growing role to play in the protection of human rights in Africa. The aims of the African Union include the promotion of peace, security, and democracy on the continent, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and People's Rights. The emergence of African standards in this area is a very welcome development. The African Union is an important strategic partner for Ireland and the European Union and for the international community generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">We will continue to proactively address human rights challenges in the course of our work in support of peace, security and development for all of the people of Africa.</p>

            <p eId="para_1801">My Department has been making good progress in regard to the relocation of 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The following business units/Offices of my Department have been selected as part of the Decentralisation Programme and will be relocated in the new decentralised office: Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies; National Employment Rights Authority (NERA); Work Permits; Redundancy Payments Section; Insolvency Payments Section.  As of 2 July 2007, the total number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow is 288.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of the permanent office, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are finalising arrangements for an advanced move to Carlow. Approximately 100 staff, i.e. 63 staff from NERA and 33 staff from a division within the CRO, along with a small number of support staff, are scheduled to decentralise to Carlow with effect from Monday 30th July 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">With regard to the permanent office, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late in 2005.  On the 31st May 2006, the OPW sought expressions of interest from developers of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department on this site.  This is part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar. The project will be procured on a Design/Build/Finance/Maintain basis and a single contract will be placed covering the three buildings. Financial advice is being provided to the OPW by the National Development Finance Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">The OPW has advised my Department that an evaluation of the Expressions of Interest was completed in February 2007, and a short-list of developers/contractors was identified from whom tenders have been invited.  Tenders are due to be returned to the OPW by the end of July. When selected, it will be a matter for the preferred tenderer to secure satisfactory planning permission in respect of each of the locations. On receipt of these permissions, the preferred tenderer will be instructed to prepare working drawings, specifications and Bills of Quantities with a view to a contract being placed and construction work commencing on the three sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The OPW has advised that, all going well, construction of the permanent office is expected at this stage to be complete in late 2009.  The remaining staff will relocate to Carlow at that point.</p>

         if he is satisfied that all contractors in the construction sector are paying established pay rates to non-Irish workers; and the level of inspections and prosecution in these sectors in this regard.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1808">The pay and conditions of workers in the Construction Industry are governed by Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) that are enforceable in accordance with the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004. The Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has authority to undertake inspections and associated enquiries to determine compliance with a range of employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with these Registered Employment Agreements. If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">All employees have the same employment rights regardless of the employee's nationality.  The Registered Employment Agreements, which set out pay and conditions for workers in the constructions sector, apply to non-Irish national employees in the same way as they apply to Irish workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Ensuring compliance with employment rights legislation is a key priority for Government and the social partners.  The Deputy will be aware that a major package of measures was agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of employment rights compliance. New legislation will be published this year to provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority. In addition, the number of Labour Inspectors is to be trebled as part of the initiative to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Almost 230 inspections or visits were undertaken in the Construction Sector during 2006 in relation to compliance with the Registered Employment Agreements.  A similar level of inspections in that sector was carried out under other employment rights legislation such as the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">The primary objective of the Labour Inspectorate in the case of the breaches detected was to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the individual/s concerned and payment of any arrears due to employees. In this regard the Inspectorate, in 2006, recovered, over all sectors, from some 349 employers, arrears of pay amounting to a total of almost €1.4 million. Prosecutions were initiated in 2006 against 24 employers in respect of breaches of employment rights legislation while prosecutions brought before the Courts in 2006 resulted in the imposition by the Courts of fines against 8 employers amounting to a total of €33,351.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">The Labour Inspectorate is currently undertaking an intensive and targeted employment rights compliance and inspection campaign within the Construction Industry. Almost 300 construction companies have been contacted to date and almost 400 inspections undertaken both in company premises and on construction sites. Joint investigations with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have also been undertaken and the three organisations are cooperating closely and exchanging information emanating from their respective independent construction inspections.</p>

The Programme started in 2000 and ends in 2007. EQUAL has been delivered in two Rounds.

While EQUAL projects are continuing to operate until the end of 2007, there is no further funding available from the European Social Fund for new projects or activity beyond 2007. Commitments must have been entered into by the end of 2006 to be admissible for funding under the rules covering EQUAL.</p>

            <p eId="para_1856">A key element of IDA Ireland's strategy for Waterford is to progress the development of a knowledge-based economy so that the County and particularly the Gateway of Waterford can compete both nationally and internationally for quality and sustainable foreign direct investment. The Agency recognises that significant progress has taken place in recent years and a number of major infrastructural projects will help to strengthen its position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards focus on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing innovation capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">These Agencies have a range of client services and financial products in place to respond to the needs of existing and new client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">IDA Ireland aims to provide world-class property solutions of scale together with supporting infrastructure in the Waterford City area in the County town of Dungarvan.  The Agency is working with local development partner agencies in Co. Waterford to advance critical infrastructure, both hard and soft, which will contribute to a sustainable business environment for the long term.  IDA Ireland is also working closely with FÁS and third level educational institutes in the region so that the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the County are being identified and developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">Since the beginning of 2004 Enterprise Ireland has approved over €6.35m and made payments of over €4.78m to its client companies in the County in support of development projects in areas such as R&amp;D, Capability Building and Process Development.  Enterprise Ireland also offers a range of services including business and marketing advice and mentoring, as well as incubation space.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">In addition the Waterford County and City Enterprise Boards provide assistance to small enterprises employing less than 10 people by providing employment and capital grants as well as grants for feasibility studies.  The Boards provide soft supports such as business advice, management and E-commerce training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">The National Spatial Strategy Gateways have the potential to accelerate growth in their regions.  I am confident that strategic local planning, prudent national and local investment in the provision of key infrastructure, a dynamic and innovative role for the private sector and local leadership can deliver this growth for the people of Waterford and its region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1963">I propose to take Questions Nos. 329, 334, 336 and 339 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">The PRSI system is designed to provide income protection to employees and the self employed in insurable employment, with entitlement to benefits based on a person experiencing certain contingencies and satisfying prescribed contribution conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">Insurable employment is employment which involves earnings from €38 per week and so the accumulation of contributions is relatively easy under the Irish system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">While the link between employment and self-employment is an essential aspect of the system, nevertheless, a number of arrangements are in place to protect the position of those who leave the workforce to care for children or adults needing care and assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in, and took effect from, 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. Those carers who receive carer's allowance or benefit can, subject to conditions, receive credited social insurance contributions. There is also a system of voluntary contributions in place which allows people who have left the workforce to continue to make social insurance contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">Overall, the range of options available under the system to deal with caring issues, the availability of the voluntary contributions system and the very low level of earnings qualifying for social insurance contributions make it easy for someone to maintain an adequate social insurance record. A number of years ago my Department met representatives of the international organisation referred to in the submissions forwarded by the Deputies to discuss the social insurance position of its volunteers. I understand that there were difficulties in reconciling the ethos of the organisation in question with the requirements of the social insurance system and that the organisation was planning to consider alternative ways of meeting the pension needs of the volunteers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">As the Deputies are aware, the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions under Towards 2016. The discussion in the Green Paper will, amongst other things, deal with the question, in the wider sense, of those who do not at present qualify for any support, contributory or non-contributory, under the social welfare pensions system and will set out the implications of making provision for these people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1976">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.

            <p eId="para_1977">The question of backdating the homemaker's scheme gives rise to difficult and complex issues, not least of which is the position of other groups excluded from social insurance cover over the years and who do not qualify for contributory pensions.  In general, changes to insurability of employment are not backdated and the same principle was applied to the homemaker's scheme when it was introduced in 1994.</p>

Decisions regarding pension provision for people who do not currently qualify for a social welfare pension will be made in the context of the framework for long-term pensions policy, which will be developed after the Green Paper has been published and a consultation process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1980">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is an income support for employees on low earnings with families.  There are some 21,055 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment with a current average weekly value of over €139.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer.  My Department has publicised the scheme regularly in order to maximise uptake by qualified families.  Following significant increases in the income limits in the 2006 budget, my Department undertook a week-long nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">This campaign, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims.  During 2006 some 13,608 new claims were received.  This compared with 7,781 in 2005 — an increase of 75%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">Family Income Supplement is paid for 52 weeks, provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions, and a claim for renewal may then be made.  The volume of claims for renewals has increased in line with the upward trend in new claims.  Renewals to 23rd June 2007 are 12,278 compared to 9,889 received in the same period in 2006.  This increase of 24% has resulted in an increase in the number of claims on hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">To date in 2007, my Department has received 19,039 new and renewal FIS claims and has decided a total of 15,309 cases.  At 23/6/07 there were 8,005 claims awaiting decision.  These were comprised of 3,371 new claims and 4,634 renewal claims.  The average time it takes to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (up to the end of May) is 10-16 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Accordingly measures have been introduced to directly address the timeliness of claim processing for FIS:</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">A review of  existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment;</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">Additional resources have been assigned specifically to improve delivery of service and the ongoing staffing requirement is under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1992">In addition, annual child benefit increases and the introduction of the early childcare supplement in 2006 in respect of all children up to six years of age have increased the overall level of child income support to all qualifying families, and proportionately more in the case of low-income families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">NESC is continuing its examination in the light of recent improvements in the area of child income support and its final report will take account of these changes.  The report, when received, will assist in future deliberations in this area.</p>

This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to people who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter.  Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">The Executive has advised that following flood damage to their residence in December 2006 the people concerned provided the Executive with an estimate of damages to their property in April 2007.  Arising from this, the local Community Welfare Service subsequently requested expenditure details and repair costs incurred as a result of the damage suffered due to the flooding in order that their application could be determined.  The Executive has advised that to date the additional information has not been provided.  The Executive further advise that if the requested information is provided the case will be further examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_2017">Over the period since 1997, the Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in successive programmes for Government aimed specifically at the group.  This included achieving the commitment to increase the basic State pension to €200 per week by 2007 in the last Budget.  Increases in both contributory and non-contributory pensions have been well ahead of inflation over the period since 1997 thus ensuring that not only was the real value of pensions maintained but that they were significantly improved in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">Looking ahead, there are three main commitments in the new programme for Government relating to weekly rates of income support for pensioners.  These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">To increase the basic State pension by around 50% to at least €300 per week by 2012;</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">To provide a personal pension payment, set at the level of a full rate State pension (non-contributory), for pensioner spouses in receipt of the qualified adult increase; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">To extend the age allowance to qualified adults over 80 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">The level of increases in weekly rates of pensions required to progress these commitments will be considered in the context of future Budgets.  My priority will be to continue the Government's policy of ensuring that every older person, be they contributory or non-contributory pensioners, has access to an income which is sufficient to sustain an acceptable standard of living.</p>

            <p eId="para_2024">The Department makes annual reports on compliance with the European Code of Social Security to the Council of Europe, summarising changes to the social welfare system.  These reports are then referred to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Committee of Experts for their examination.  The Department's 1999 report included details of the self-employed provisions which are now the subject of the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) investigation. At that time the ILO Committee confirmed that Ireland met its obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">Accordingly, as an initial step in its review of the IHRC report, my Department has asked the ILO Committee of Experts for its views on the way in which the IHRC has interpreted the relevant articles.  An informal opinion received from the ILO Secretariat suggests that the Code does not require payment of a pension no matter how few contributions have been paid.  My Department is seeking a formal review of the situation in the context of our annual report which will be submitted in August.  While my Department will press for an early opinion, I understand that it is likely that it will take a number of months to receive.  The position will then be re-examined in light of the views received.</p>

            <p eId="para_2032">The Executive has advised that the person concerned applied for a rent supplement in January 2007 but was refused as her rent was in excess of the rent limit for her family size.

The Executive's Appeals Officer allowed her appeal in view of her changed circumstances and the Executive was notified of the decision on 26th June.

            <p eId="para_2080">The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that the headquarters will move to Portlaoise (involving some 600 staff); the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy (involving up to 100 staff); and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom (again involving up to 100 staff).</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">My Department's Decentralisation Implementation plan provides for a phased movement to Portlaoise i.e. the transfer of functions and posts over a number of years.  The 2005 and 2006 phases of Decentralisation are now complete and planning and preparation are ongoing for the remainder of 2007 and subsequent phases.  In total there has been an increase of some 200 full-time posts in Portlaoise since early 2004 and there are currently over 400 Department of Agriculture and Food staff in Portlaoise.  Implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are also in place and the recruitment process for Fermoy has begun.  Initially there were 73 applicants for the 100 posts advertised for Fermoy and 74 for the 100 posts advertised for Macroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">To cater for the increase in staff numbers, my Department has taken temporary accommodation in Portlaoise.  This is now fully occupied and the OPW are sourcing additional space to cater for further advance moves.  The site for the location of my Department's new offices in Portlaoise was approved in 2005.  The OPW's current estimate is that construction will begin in 2007 and will be completed in 2009.  My Department is also liaising with the OPW regarding specifications for the offices and identification of sites in Fermoy and Macroom.</p>

Category C caters for farmers who sold their milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">The father of the person named sold his milk quota in April 2004 and ceased farming.  He leased his farm and any associated Single Payment entitlements to the person named in March 2004.  As the person named was neither an active milk producer nor the owner of a milk quota he did not therefore satisfy the criteria for Category C.  The person named submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">This case was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who upheld my Departments decision.  However, the person named has requested a review of the decision taken by the Independent Appeals Committee.  His request will be put before the next meeting of this Committee and following this meeting the Committee will contact him directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">The person named also applied for consideration under the 2006 National Reserve under Categories A and B.  However, he did not provide sufficient documentation to allow my Department to finalise his application.  My Department has been in touch with him and is awaiting the receipt of the required documentation in order to fully process his application.  Following processing the person named will be notified directly of the outcome of his 2006 National Reserve application.</p>

            <p eId="para_2177">The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2006 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category A.  Category A caters for farmers who inherit, lease or receive land free of charge or for a nominal amount from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and where the land was leased out by the original owner during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</p>

The person named submitted an appeal against this decision on 27 June 2007 and also submitted new evidence in support of his appeal.

            <p eId="para_2181">The position is that an application under the Single Payment Scheme/ Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 15 May 2006.  As part of the control procedures, the application was randomly selected for a Satellite Inspection.  The results of the Satellite Inspection indicated that there was a discrepancy in the area claimed by the applicant.  As a result of this discrepancy it was necessary to issue a request for a Ground Eligibility Inspection to be completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The ground eligibility inspection was undertaken on 14 November 2006.  During the course of the inspection discrepancies were found with a number of parcels.  As a result of these discrepancies the claimed area of 35.65ha was reduced to 25.58ha.  The person named was informed of these findings on 6 December 2006.  If the total Standard area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held the penalties will be applied as per Article 50/51/53 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 796/2004 and per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 55.8.  As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 20%, under EU Regulations, no payment will issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">The person named requested a review of this decision on 9 February 2007.  The reviewer concluded that the declaration of a forestry plot on the application was a genuine error and agreed to remove the plot from the application.  This reduced the difference between the area declared and the area found to 9.38% which, under EU Regulations, resulted in the difference being doubled and a total area of 20.94 Ha being put forward to payment.  This payment is currently being processed and will issue shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">The person named was informed of this decision on 27 April 2007 and of his right to appeal the decision to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  To date, no appeal has been lodged.</p>

            <p eId="para_2236">Four hundred (400) Dublin based posts in my Department will relocate under the programme of decentralisation. One hundred posts (100) will relocate to Athlone and 300 posts will relocate to Mullingar. These posts will relocate when office accommodation is ready for occupation in Athlone and Mullingar respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2237">The provision of accommodation under the programme of decentralisation falls within the remit of the Office of Public Works (OPW). The OPW has indicated to the Decentralisation Implementation Group that it anticipates that new office accommodation will be ready in Athlone next year and that it should be ready in Mullingar sometime in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2238">As the accommodation element of the programme will be managed by the OPW, the main element of the preparation to be made by my Department is the assignment of volunteers to decentralise to posts in which they will decentralise, along with arranging the transfer out to other offices/departments of those officers currently working with my Department who wish to remain in Dublin. Approximately 43% of posts scheduled to relocate to Athlone are now held by officers who will relocate with their posts and 36% of posts to relocate to Mullingar are held by officers who will decentralise with their posts. All of the information available to my Department suggests that it will be possible to fill all of the relocating posts in the decentralised locations. I expect that these percentages will rise incrementally over the coming year/years. An incremental movement of staff is necessary, if my Department is to continue to deliver services during this period of transition. However, a number of posts will be filled very close to the date of actual relocation in order to avoid requiring volunteers who are currently based outside of Dublin having to spend a significant length of time in Dublin in advance of moving to their location of choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">My Department is managing the implementation of decentralisation within its existing resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2242">Data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 83 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.</p>

In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">The school referred to by the Deputy lodged an appeal with the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. This appeal was heard at the Appeal Board meeting on the 22 May, 2007 and was refused.</p>

            <p eId="para_2248">The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 24th May, 2007.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2259">My Department's position remains that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism. The issue of contention is whether ABA should be the only method used in some settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">Advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the Inspectorate inform my Department's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.</p>
            <p eId="para_2261">By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, we are doing what we are advised is the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2262">It should be noted that teachers in special schools were using ABA principles more than 25 years ago. ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades. The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department, therefore, does support the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, we do not accept — based on research, advice and best practice — that it should be the only method used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">Approximately 200 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. There are a maximum of 6 children in each special class with a teacher and at least 2 Special Needs Assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. A child can have their own SNA if they need one.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">The Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Government contains a specific commitment in relation to the 12 pilot ABA centres that were established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">The Government is committed to long term funding for these 12 pilots, subject to agreement on standards that will enable my department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. Areas in which standards need to be agreed include the professional qualifications of the staff and the educational programme available to the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2268">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, since the launch of the Programme for Government, my officials have met with the advocacy group for the pilot centres concerned to progress the implementation of this commitment. This follows on from previous discussions with the group on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2271">The closing date for receipt of applications under the Dormant Accounts/ RAPID Leverage Fund Small Scale Capital Grants Scheme for schools was 1st March. The scheme covers the improvement of existing facilities (‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities (‘new-builds') in four areas: (i) Outdoor Play Facilities; (ii) Libraries; (iii) Parent Rooms; and (iv) Dining Areas. Schools were asked to list their proposals under the four areas in terms of priorities from 1 to 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants. This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications. As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">Phase 1 of this process involved an assessment of all ‘new-build' and ‘non new-build' applications for Outdoor Play Facilities which were identified by the schools as either Priority 1, 2 or 3 — lower priorities are not being assessed because there is insufficient funding available. Subject to Government Approval, which is based on these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">All proposals in respect of Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas involving ‘new-builds' will be considered for funding under the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme. The assessment and approval of the ‘non new-build' proposals for Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas is currently in progress and schools will be notified about their applications in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">The school referred to by the Deputy has applied for a grant of €175,000 towards the provision of Library facilities ('New-Build') under the Scheme.</p>

A re-assessment of projected enrolments, demographic trends and housing developments in the area is required in order to assist in determining the long term projected enrolment for the school on which the school's long term accommodation needs will be based.  In order to determine how best to provide for the school's accommodation needs into the future, it also in due course be necessary to have a technical assessment of existing school buildings and site carried out. The outcome of this technical assessment will help to determine whether or not the proposed project will be an extension of existing buildings on the current school site or a new school on a new greenfield site.</p>

            <p eId="para_2299">In September 2005 I announced funding of €300 million for an Education PPP Programme comprising of 23 new post-primary schools and 4 new primary schools under a major expansion of the Government's Public Private Partnership Programme from 2006 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2300">Work commenced immediately on identifying the projects to go into bundles for procurement. The first bundle of schools announced in November 2005 comprises of Banagher College-Colaiste na Sionna, Gallen Community School, Ferbane, Scoil Chriost Ri, Portlaoise and St Mary's CBS, Portlaoise. 2,700 pupil places will be provided when these schools are completed. This bundle completed pre-procurement and was handed over to the National Development Finance Agency in September 2006. The NDFA, in consultation with my Department have responsibility for the procurement process. The pre-qualification of bidders was completed in December 2006 and three short-listed bidders were selected on 22nd December 2006. The Invitation to Tender issued on 15th March 2007 and completed tenders are to be returned on 13th July 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">I announced the 2nd bundle of primary/post-primary projects in November 2006 and pre procurement work is ongoing on this bundle. This bundle comprises Bantry Community College and Gaelscoil Bheanntrai, Co. Cork, Kildare Town Community School, Abbeyfeale Community College, Athboy Community School and Wicklow Town Community College. This bundle will provide in excess of 4,200 pupil places when completed. Work on this bundle including schedules of accommodation, outline planning permission and stakeholder consultation has already commenced and it is anticipated that it will be offered to the market in late 2007 subject to planning issues being completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">It is anticipated that construction of bundle 1 will commence in late 2007 with a view to completion in early 2009, while construction of bundle 2 is likely to commence in 2008 with completion expected in early 2010.

In the English language sector, programmes which meet these duration criteria, are recognised under the quality assurance and inspection scheme of the Advisory Council of English Language Schools (ACELS), and which lead to recognised English language proficiency tests, are eligible for inclusion on the Register.  The language proficiency tests which are recognised for this purpose are listed in the Information Note.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">For courses other than language courses, the programmes are required to meet the minimum duration criteria, and lead to an award which is validated by  FETAC, HETAC, DIT or a recognised university, or by a professional body with a function in Irish law, or by a national awarding body from another country which has a status in law or is otherwise recognised as having authority to make awards which have national recognition in their host jurisdiction. Programmes published as full time programmes of an least one year's duration leading to HETAC, FETAC, DIT or university awards are deemed to meet the duration criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The Department of Education and Science does not stipulate specific language proficiency levels which should be reached on completion of a programme as students enter Ireland to study for a variety of reasons, e.g to learn English ab initio, to learn English in order to access a third level programme, or to English in order to prepare for a specific employment.  In general, third level colleges, which determine their own admission criteria, generally require a minimum proficiency score of 4.5, 5.0 and 6.0 respectively on the International English Language Testing System or equivalent for entry to higher education programmes leading to awards at Level 6, 7 and 8 or higher in the national framework of qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">It is intended that the criteria for inclusion of programmes on the Register will be further strengthened, after consultation with stakeholders, when Education Ireland is established. Education Ireland will promote and market Ireland as a quality venue for international education, will develop and ensure compliance with quality standards and a code of practice for pastoral care of students, and will subsume the functions of the Advisory Council for English Language Schools and responsibility for the Internationalisation Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">In exceptional cases, where difficulties have occurred, the Department reserves to right to impose specific additional conditions on a provider.  In such cases, this can include a requirement that admission to a specific  programme should be confined to students who reach a minimum language proficiency level prior to entry.  This has been done where the programme in question is targeted to meet a specific objective, such as access to a particular employment, and is designed to ensure that students have a reasonable opportunity to complete the programme successfully and meet their objectives within the timeframe of the programme.</p>

         if she will appoint wholetime home-school liaison officers to schools in RAPID areas; her views on the need for such posts to provide supports for schools, pupils and families in these areas; and if she will make provision for a home school liaison officer in a school (details supplied) in County Louth.

            <p eId="para_2349">Under DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, which is currently being implemented by my Department, 80 additional posts have been allocated in order to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all 338 urban/town primary and 203 second level schools participating in DEIS that do not currently have a HSCL service, in addition to the 370 local coordinators already in place.  To facilitate local HSCL co-ordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children, for the first time posts are being shared across the two sectors — primary and post-primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">I have also given a commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL Scheme, that they will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007.  HSCL services will be provided to some 652 schools in total (282 second level and 370 primary schools) for the duration of the DEIS action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">DEIS provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme.  DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases.  Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates)</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">Junior Certificate retention rates by school</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS — "Overall Performance Scale" — score).</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best. Leaving Certificate retention rates by school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy, but it was not among those schools recommended for inclusion in the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">Schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the DEIS programme will continue to be supported in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students.</p>

        <b>Deputy Dan Neville</b>
         asked the

         the position regarding the application by a school (details supplied) for funding from the dormant accounts fund.

            <p eId="para_2362">The closing date for receipt of applications under the Dormant Accounts/RAPID Leverage Fund Small Scale Capital Grants Scheme for schools was 1st March.  The scheme covers the improvement of existing facilities (‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities (‘new-builds') in four areas: (i) Outdoor Play Facilities; (ii) Libraries; (iii) Parent Rooms; and (iv) Dining Areas. Schools were asked to list their proposals under the four areas in terms of priorities from 1 to 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants.  This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications.  As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">Phase 1 of this process involved an assessment of all ‘new-build' and ‘non new-build' applications for Outdoor Play Facilities which were identified by the schools as either Priority 1, 2 or 3 — lower priorities are not being assessed because there is insufficient funding available.  Subject to Government Approval, which is based on these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">All proposals in respect of Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas involving ‘new-builds' will be considered for funding under the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme.  The assessment and approval of the ‘non new-build' proposals for Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas is currently in progress and schools will be notified about their applications in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, it should be noted that the school applied for the following under the scheme:</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">Dining Room (New build): €175,000 — Priority 1 (plus Catering Equipment €5000)</p>
            <p eId="para_2368">Library facilities (New Build): €175,000 — Priority 2</p>
            <p eId="para_2369">Parent Room (New Build): €150,000 — Priority 3</p>

            <p eId="para_2383">Data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 270 pupils.

            <p eId="para_2385">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.

            <p eId="para_2404">The Deputy is aware that children on the autistic spectrum need access to individualised education programmes which draw on a range of interventions, including ABA.  Advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the Inspectorate informs my Department's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one.  An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">By enabling children in special autism-specific classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, my Department is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.  In addition, children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA.  The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.  Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.  Approximately 200 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_673">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2407">I have no plans to introduce driver education, in the form of driving lessons, in schools, and this is not the norm within the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">Nonetheless, I do believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.  As such, the development of a Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year is at an advanced stage.  This work is being undertaken by the Road Safety Authority in co-operation with my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and is due for piloting in a number of second-level schools in the first term of the  2007/2008 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The Road Safety Programme for Transition Year will provide a structured approach towards the development of responsible attitudes towards road safety and driver education and will build on the knowledge gained from current Social Personal and Health Education programmes (SPHE).  Covering areas such as seat belt use, hazard perception and driver attitudes towards alcohol and drug use the Transition Year Road Safety Programme will also prepare students for the Driver Theory Test.  The Road Safety Authority has also obtained input from the Gardai, NCT centres and Bus Eireann in the delivery of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">In April 2007, the Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched covering key road safety issues.  This has been piloted successfully in schools and will be available for live implementation in 07/08.  The Transition Year Programme currently being finalised will build further on this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">In addition, the Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students.  SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools. At the start of the 2001/02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive — a road safety resource for Transition Year and the Senior Cycle — to all second level schools.  This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users.  A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road.  In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety.  Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.  This is also supplemented by Garda visits to primary and second level schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the SPHE programme.  There were some 1900 school visits in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">So, not only is there a curricular framework in place already in which the importance of road safety can be taught to our young people, but this is supplemented by specific teaching materials and by a comprehensive programme of Garda visits to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.</p>

         her plans for increasing third level maintenance grants for the year 2007/2008 in view of their present subsistence level.

            <p eId="para_2418">I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that I have secured approval for a 10% increase in the standard rate of student grant with effect from September next.  This very substantial increase, at twice the rate of inflation, will benefit over 56,000 students who receive a maintenance grant to attend higher and further education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">This will mean an increase in the maximum rate of ordinary grant to €3,420 for 2007/08 and students who qualify will also have the student service charge paid on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">In addition, over 12,500 students in receipt of the "Special Rate" of maintenance grant will benefit from an even more substantial increase of over 14%, with the maximum rate for 2007/08 increasing to €6,690.</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">In parallel with these significant rate increases, the annual income thresholds to qualify for student grants will also be increased with effect from the coming September.  The annual income thresholds for the ordinary rate of maintenance grant are being increased by 3.5%, while the threshold for the special rate of maintenance grant is being increased by 7.8% to €18,055.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">Financial barriers have long being recognised as a major disincentive for many students who wish to access third level education.  This significant increase in the ordinary rate of maintenance grant, at twice the level of inflation, will make the third level option more affordable for a broad range of students and their families.  In approving an even higher increase in the special rate of maintenance grant, I am further targeting that support at those most in need, to encourage access to further and higher education for everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">This Government's continued commitment to supporting high rates of participation in third level education at all levels of society will ensure that Ireland continues to attract and maintain investment in high quality jobs and that the fruits of the economy can be enjoyed by all.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">The revised 2007/08 student grant schemes have already issued to the awarding bodies, the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  This year, the schemes have been made available a month earlier than in 2006, facilitating a substantial level of service improvement for students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">The new schemes can be accessed and/or downloaded from the "Students &amp; Trainees" section of the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie.</i>

            <p eId="para_2477">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2478">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.

            <p eId="para_2511">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.   I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

Conscious that some parents occasionally encounter difficulties in securing the services of a qualified tuition provider, my Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to provide a central database of suitably trained personnel seeking employment as home tutors.</p>

This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.

            <p eId="para_2540">The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, was requested to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for the school in question.

Six sites have been visited and their technical suitability as a location for the school was considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">Following this process, a site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Institute (TRBDI) campus emerged as the preferred option. This site is in the ownership of the Institute.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">The TRBDI, however, has proposed to the Department that its campus be relocated to a large-scale technology park.

            <p eId="para_2543">The Expressions of Interest sought required the incorporation of a suitable site for the school on the current campus or on an alternative site approved by the Department and the Office of Public Works. The Expressions of Interest received by TRBDI have been evaluated and detailed negotiations are being entered into with the company that has submitted the tender provisionally identified as being the most advantageous.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">While this process is reasonably well advanced, I appreciate that it is taking longer than expected. Given the urgency of the schools' needs the Department will seek alternative site options in Clonmel, with a view to acquiring a site before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2559">The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants. This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications. As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.</p>

Subject to Government approval, which is based on these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.</p>

Schools were asked to list their proposals under the four areas in terms of priorities from 1 to 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants. This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications. As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">Phase 1 of this process involved an assessment of all ‘new-build' and ‘non new-build' applications for Outdoor Play Facilities which were identified by the schools as either Priority 1, 2 or 3 — lower priorities are not being assessed because there is insufficient funding available. Subject to Government approval, which is based on these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">All proposals in respect of Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas involving new-builds' will be considered for funding under the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme. The assessment and approval of the ‘non new-build' proposals for Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas is currently in progress and schools will be notified about their applications in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2639">Significant progress has been made in progressing a range of areas highlighted in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences e.g.</p>
            <p eId="para_2640">A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1000 per school plus €10 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects — Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) — is well advanced. The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme. In that context, €16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools. The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at €18.8m annually. The current cost of such provision is estimated at c€24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed €120m annually if applied to other practical subjects. While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visit the issue. A decision on this issue can only be made in the context of the resources available from time to time in the Estimates. There have been no meetings with the Department of Finance in relation to the provision of laboratory assistants to schools. When education partners have raised this issue at meetings, they have been advised that there are no immediate plans to provide such assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">Other aspects of the Plan include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age,</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">strengthening teacher training in this area</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula</p>
            <p eId="para_2650">promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2652">Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</p>

Appeals may be made in respect of a decision to (i) permanently exclude a student (ii) suspend a student from the school for a period which would bring the cumulative period of suspension to 20 school days in any one school year or (iii) refuse to enrol a student.

            <p eId="para_2690">My Department has part funded the Leanbh Project since 2001. This project is an initiative, operated by the ISPCC since 1997, to work with children who are sighted begging in the greater Dublin areas and their parents. Leanbh engages with children begging on the streets, assesses the level of risk to the child and refers children to relevant statutory services when appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2691">Under Section 247(1) of the Children Act 2001 a person is guilty of an offence if they procure a child or allow a child in their care to be in any street or public place for the purpose of begging. Section 247(3) provides that a person found guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €250, in the case of a first offence, or €500 for a second or subsequent offence. These provisions were not the subject of the recent court case referred to by the Deputy.  However, I will be seeking formal confirmation from the Attorney General's Office that the outcome of that case has no ramifications for the operation of the 2001 Act provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2692">I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Children, that the Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a child welfare and protection service under their statutory responsibilities in the Child Care Act, 1991.  A child protection service is provided in all areas and an out of hours service is available in the Dublin area.  A wide range of family support services are provided by the HSE and by agencies funded and supported by the HSE for children and families at risk of abuse or neglect.  The HSE provides grant aid to Focus Ireland to provide an outreach service to homeless children.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2699">The offence of begging arises under Section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847. It is subject to a penalty of up to 1 month imprisonment.  The High Court delivered its judgement recently in the case of Niall Dillon -v- The DPP.  That case concerned the constitutionality of section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  The Court held that the provision is unconstitutional.  The Court's written judgement is still awaited.  It will be examined when it becomes available, with a view to determining the appropriate response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2700">The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Vagrancy and related offences (LRC11-1985) examined provisions relating to the offence of begging.  The recommendations of the Commission included proposals for the repeal of the entire Vagrancy Act 1847, Section 2 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act 1904 and certain parts of Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824.  The Commission recommended that new legislative provisions should be introduced, making it an offence to beg (i) in a public place, or (ii) from house to house in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance.  The Commission also recommended that the maximum penalty for this offence be a fine of £100 and/or one month imprisonment.  The Commission's other recommendations pertained to provisions related to causing or procuring a child to beg (this aspect was addressed in the Children Act 2001) and an offence relating to those collecting for charities under the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962 who obstruct a passerby in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance.  The Commission's recommendations will be among the matters to be considered once the judgement in the Dillon case becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2701">The Deputy may be aware that following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2702">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics for the period 2003 to 2006 sought by the Deputy directly to him.  The relevant statistics for the remainder of the period mentioned by the Deputy, i.e. 2000 to 2002, are available in the Annual Reports of the Garda Síochána for the years in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_2704">The information requested by the Deputy insofar as the current Members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are concerned and the remuneration paid to each of them, is set out in Table 1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2705">As you are aware, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act, 1996 in order to deal with appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC).  The Tribunal has been in operation since November 2000 and comprised a full time Chairperson and 29 part time Members at present.  Members of the Tribunal are appointed for a renewable term of three years.  The Tribunal has undertaken a significant job of work since its establishment having completed some 27,000 appeals up to the end of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2706">In line with the general downward trend in asylum applications from, for example, 11,634 in 2002 to 4,314 in 2006, the cost of the operation of the Tribunal can also be expected to continue to fall.  This will allow the continued redeployment of resources from the asylum process to support the capacity of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) to enhance service provision in the area of immigration (visas, citizenship etc.) as well as increasing the number of persons, found not to have a protection need, being returned to their country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2707">In relation to the additional information requested by the Deputy regarding individual Members, I am advised by the Chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that as his organisation is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, it would be inappropriate for him to provide the requested information.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2772">I propose to take Questions Nos. 483 to 485, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">The Irish Prison Service is committed to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and to encourage the attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law abiding and self-supporting lives after release.  Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and other statutory and non-statutory services.  Among these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">Details of the major services available in prisons are set out as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">Education — Education in prisons is provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  In 2006, 220 whole-time-equivalent VEC teachers were the main providers of these education programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">Work Training — The Work Training programme operates at each prison.  As well as organising necessary services such as catering and laundry, it also provides work and training opportunities for prisoners whilst ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison.  Work Training provides structured pre-vocational and vocational training so that persons in custody can acquire the skills that may help them to obtain employment after their release.  The Programme for Organisational Change provided for a significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes.  This is being facilitated by an increased budgetary allocation and by an increase of almost 100 in the prison grade staff involved in work and training activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">Probation Service — This Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner's sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">Chaplaincy Service — Prison Chaplains promote the spiritual and pastoral welfare of prisoners and also participate with other services in the secular care of prisoners.  The work of the Chaplaincy Service involves extensive contact with prisoners on personal and family matters as well as other issues which arise in relation to their confinement in prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2779">Psychology Service — The principal aim of this service is to provide, in co-operation with others, a generic therapeutic service to prisoners aimed at addressing their psychological needs and at reducing re-offending.</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">Drug Treatment — Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of Voluntary Drug Testing Units (also known as drug-free areas).</p>
            <p eId="para_2781">The new Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy — Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons — will see existing drug treatment programmes being expanded and enhanced with the further recruitment of nurses, psychologists and 24 dedicated addiction counsellors, as well as other staff including prison officers.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and will see a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment service in the prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">Sex Offender Programmes — Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  In this regard, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention currently available — i.e. individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994, and the Psychiatric Service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">Participation Levels — Participation in education generally varies with factors such as access, facilities, turnover of population and segregation.  At the end of 2006, 54% of prisoners in thirteen of our institutions were involved in some education (following the opening of the education unit in Cloverhill in late 2006, educational services are now available at all institutions).  29% of the total prison population in these institutions were intensively involved, i.e., for more than 10 hours per week of classes.  This level of involvement in education whilst in prison is very high by international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">There are 90 workshops operating under the work and training programme, which actively cater each day for over 860 prisoners, representing about 26% of the average daily prisoner population.  A total of 122 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date.  A further seven men are currently undertaking the programme in Arbour Hill Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">In addition to this, a large number of prisoners engage with services (e.g. Psychology, Probation Services) in the prisons on a one to one basis to address issues related to their offending and imprisonment.  This may involve brief time limited intervention or, in certain cases, ongoing contact throughout their sentence.  The same situation applies for the large number of in reach services operating in prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">In addition, the new Programme for Government contains significant commitments in the area of prisoner rehabilitation.  My Department will be working closely with the Irish Prison Service to implement these commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2788">In addition to the ongoing implementation of the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs out of Prison, the Deputy will also be aware that I have recently announced a range of security measures aimed at keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 staff and an appropriate number of dogs; the Deputy will be aware that a pilot drug detection dog service has been in place since 23 May 2006 and is currently running in the Midlands/Portlaoise area and also in Wheatfield/Cloverhill Prisons and in the Mountjoy complex;</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The introduction of enhanced security screening and searching of all persons (prisoners, visitors and staff) entering our prisons.There are currently drug free units in Wheatfield Prison and St. Patrick's Institution.   There is also a detox programme in operation in Mountjoy.  Allied to this the Training Unit, Arbour Hill, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are regarded as drug free institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">I am committed to ensuring that all prisons are drug free in line with commitments in the Drugs Policy and Strategy.  It is extremely difficult to quantify the numbers of prisoners who can be deemed to be drug free, particularly given the extremely covert nature of illicit drug taking in a custodial setting and the absence to date of mandatory drug testing.  In this context, the new Prison Rules 2007, which will come into effect on 01/10/2007 include specific provisions for mandatory drug testing.</p>

         his plans for fighting the nationwide drugs problem; the dedicated resources being put into combating drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_737">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2796">The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.  The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.  I fully support this approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_2797">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Pat Carey, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Siochána will continue to direct its drug law enforcement activities in a focused way through intelligence driven operations at national, regional, divisional and district level.  Underpinning this approach, An Garda Siochána will continue to invoke a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue.  These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">Conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">The Garda National Drugs Unit co-ordinates large scale operations against drug dealing/ trafficking and Unit personnel either investigate such cases themselves or assist local investigation teams.  Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  A joint Garda National Drugs Unit/Criminal Assets Bureau initiative is in place which targets local dealers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2804">Significant drug seizures in this jurisdiction continue to be made as a result of this approach as evidenced by last weekend's successful policing operation in West Dublin. Such measures will continue to be vigorously pursued by An Garda Siochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">With regard to resources, the extent of resources both in financial and personnel terms, which continues to be  made available to An Garda Siochána is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.  The record figure of €5.27m allocated to the Garda National Drugs Unit in 2006 and the 103 vehicles allocated to the local Drugs Units last year (a 12% increase on the number of vehicles available in 2002) are examples of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">In terms of personnel resources, I am informed by the Garda authorities that currently there is a total of 342 Gardaí dedicated to national and regional drugs units.  These units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition all Gardaí are tasked with confronting drugs related issues as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">Furthermore in relation to the broader issues of Garda resources being made available by the Government, I can assure the Deputy that additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time, with an accelerated intake of approximately 1100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College.  These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">In conjunction with this, the Government are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies continue to have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work in tackling those involved in such criminal activity.  The drug related provisions included in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 are recent examples of this policy.  Finally I can assure the Deputy that the Government is very clear that there is no room for complacency in our response to the issue of drug misuse.  The events in West Cork yesterday demonstrate this very clearly.  Under my own area of remit, I would stress again that the enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2816">The responsibilities of parents and guardians of offending youths are recognised in the youth justice system as being of key significance with regard to the behaviour of any child in their care.  The Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides a number of measures to take action in respect of parents or guardians of children found guilty of an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2817">Under the Act, an order can be made that a parent or guardian responsible for a child pay compensation to the victim or victims of any offence committed by that child.  Also, a parent or guardian may be bound over by the court to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit a recognisance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">In addition, if a judge is satisfied that ‘wilful failure of a child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour', the judge can, at his/her discretion impose a Parental Supervision Order.  For example, parents or guardians can be ordered to participate in a parenting skills course or, if necessary, to undergo treatment for alcohol or other substance abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the judiciary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Children, that the Health Service Executive operate community based high support programmes to work specifically with problematic children on an individual basis, for example, Youth Advocacy Programmes and Extern.  Family support programmes are provided by services such as the Community Mothers, Family Support Workers, Teen Parents Support Projects and Spring Board Projects and encompass specific interventions such as the Parents Plus programme, as well as a range of general parenting programmes and supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to foster the Parents Plus approach to support families and parents and to establish local programmes to help parents, including parenting classes for those whose children have been identified as most at risk of future anti-social behaviour.  I will be discussing with the Minister for Children how this commitment can best be implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_2838">Each of these CCTV systems is operated by the Garda Síochána and is equipped with technology to monitor, read and print images recorded by the system.

In addition to the monitoring of images in real time, all images are recorded and can be reviewed at short notice when required.

            <p eId="para_2856">Following signature by the President and consultation with the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, an order signed by my predecessor brought 54 sections and two Schedules of the Criminal Justice Act, 2007, into operation either with immediate effect or, in some cases, with effect from 1 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">The Act introduces a new requirement whereby applicants for bail may have to provide a statement of their means, their previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail.  It also provides that a Garda Superintendent may give an opinion that bail should be refused on the grounds that the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence if granted bail.  Several changes were made to the technical rules relating to the operation of bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_2858">The aim of the changes is to enable the prosecution to more effectively challenge applications for bail and to improve the quality of decision-making in relation to bail applications, in particular those from persons charged with serious offences.  The new bail regime introduced in the Act of 2007 will be assessed in a formal annual review process.  The review will determine whether further amendments to the operation of the bail system are required.</p>

            <p eId="para_2860">As the Deputy is aware, we have a "without prejudice" system of prosecution appeals. The implications of this are that if an appeal is successful, the point of law will have been clarified in favour of the prosecution but the court does not actually reverse the acquittal. In addition, our law does not provide a prosecution right of appeal in respect of an acquittal where new evidence is discovered or an allegation of trial tampering is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2861">I am aware that there is a strong public interest in ensuring that a defendant who does in fact have a case to answer should not benefit by reason of an erroneous ruling of the trial judge or from the application of the principle against double jeopardy.  For this reason my predecessor directed that consideration of this matter be included in  the remit of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group which he established under the chairmanship of Dr Gerard Hogan S.C. last November to examine aspects of the criminal law. The final report of that Group was published on 23 March 2007. Amongst its many recommendations the report makes a number of recommendations for changes to our prosecution appeals system. In particular it recommends that:</p>
            <p eId="para_2862">a "with prejudice" right of redress against erroneous decisions by a trial judge should be introduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_2863">legislation should be enacted to give a right to the prosecution to complain in respect of miscarriages of justice in cases where there is new or newly discovered evidence, subject to certain safeguards;</p>
            <p eId="para_2864">a review of acquittals should be available in the event of interference with the process, whether the interference is in respect of the jury or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">While I am aware that there is considerable support in both Houses of the Oireachtas for change along the lines proposed by the Review Group — this was clear during the debate on the Criminal Justice Act 2007  — these recommendations are far-reaching and as such require careful consideration and consultation with various parties.   Accordingly, I will be giving the issues further consideration before coming to a view on legislation in this area.</p>

Twenty three posts from the Garda Ombudsman Commission and fifty four from the Equality Authority are due to relocate to Roscrea.  An advance move of the Equality Authority has already commenced, with five staff having taken up duty in Roscrea in May 2007, and an additional fifteen to follow before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2870">One hundred and eighty six posts from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (I.N.I.S.) are to relocate to Tipperary and an advance move of up to fifty staff is being considered subject to the availability of suitable accommodation.

In the context of the review, I am monitoring the number of racist incidents, those that end up in the courts, the legislation under which persons are being charged and the outcome of proceedings in the courts.

Dunboyne Garda Station forms part of the Ashbourne Garda District. The personnel strength of Ashbourne Garda District on 31 December, 1997 and on 2 July, 2007 was 56 and 80 (all ranks) respectively.

The Garda Commissioner advises me  that the person in question was unable to produce a valid travel document or a valid registration card when he sought leave to re-enter the State at Dublin Airport on 15th May 2007. This constitutes a criminal offence under Section 12 of the Immigration Act, 2004 and in such circumstances an Immigration Officer is entitled to refuse the person leave to land and have him/her removed from the State.  The person in question claimed to be travelling from the UK but on examination of his out of date travel document, the Immigration Officer could find no UK immigration stamp applicable to his dates of travel or evidence of him  being granted a visa to visit the UK. Enquiries made with the UK authorities revealed no record of the person having applied for or been granted  a visa to travel to the UK.

            <p eId="para_2899">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been five adult behaviour warnings issued in Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Garda Division, which includes Clondalkin and Lucan, from 1 January, 2007 to 31 May, 2007.  There have been no child behaviour warnings, civil orders, or behaviour orders issued in the DMR West Division from 1 March, 2007 to 31 May, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">With regard to both adult and children, a behaviour warning remains in place for three months from date of issue.  With regard to children specifically, a good behaviour contract lasts for six months, but may be renewed for a further three months. The approach which the legislation adopts is to make every effort for the child and his or her parents or guardian to address the child's behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the criminal justice system.  The Act ensures that there is full parental involvement at all relevant stages.  It is therefore highly unlikely that a Garda officer would apply for a civil order or a behaviour order before the end of these periods.</p>

            <p eId="para_3037">The person in question can make an application to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department for residence in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.

Applications of this kind, in fairness to all other such applications, are dealt with in strict chronological order and currently take approximately twelve months to process.</p>

         if he will commence Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000, which provides for the labelling of all alcoholic beverages sold for off-premises consumption with the name of the seller; when he will commence that Section; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [18929/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_773">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3040">Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which provided that a label containing the name and address of premises to which an on-licence or off-licence was attached be clearly indicated on label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor was sold for consumption off the premises, was repealed by section 3 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2003.  Section 22 of the 2003 Act provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_3041">While the labelling of containers in which alcohol is sold with a view to combatting under-age consumption is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arise under two headings.  Firstly, practical difficulties will be encountered where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raises the important issue of whether the label should be attached at the point of sale or earlier in the supply/ distribution chain.  Attaching labels at an early stage would be simpler but this would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and lead in turn to increased distribution costs.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of goods. Also, it would be naive to overlook the possibility of labels being removed, or rendered non-legible, after sale.  The possible transfer of the contents from a labelled container to another unmarked container cannot be ruled out either.</p>
            <p eId="para_3042">Secondly, from an enforcement perspective it is clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container does not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container had been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container.  It may have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the underage person.  Indeed, a labelled container may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of an underage person.</p>
            <p eId="para_3043">Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and the matter was subsequently raised with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General's Office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is, therefore, cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">One option that could possibly be considered in the context of future legislation would be a presumption that any alcohol container found in the possession of an underage person had been purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved.  However, the Attorney General's Office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3045">For these reasons, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time.  I will, however, give serious consideration in the context of future legislation to any reasonable and workable proposal that would deal with this matter without giving rise to the difficulties that I have outlined.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3079">I propose to take Questions Nos. 529, 531 to 535, inclusive, and 538 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible, inter alia, for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers through the policy of direct provision. The RIA is a cross-departmental Agency which coordinates service provision in areas including health, education and welfare. The RIA, through contracts with commercial sector providers, currently provides accommodation for 6,107 persons in 58 centres across 25 counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3081">In relation to the level of female staff, the staffing of such centres is a matter for the contractor.  Contracts between the provider and RIA refer to appropriate staffing levels and compliance with relevant employment and equality legislation.  The issue of child protection is taken very seriously.  Indeed, in my former role as Minister for Children, l launched the RIA's Child Protection Policy in December, 2005.  This policy was drafted with the assistance of the HSE and in consultation with RIA and  accommodation centre staff. The policy includes protocols for addressing child welfare concerns appropriately and effectively. All centres which accommodate children have at least one Designated Liaison Person on child protection issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">A needs assessment was also undertaken by the RIA regarding the needs of children and families in RIA managed accommodation.  This assessment incorporated consultation with a wide range of agencies, and this has enabled the improvement of inter-agency links and coordinated service delivery, as well as promoting a more pro-active response from organisations such as youth services, County/City Child Care Committees, Vocational Education Committees, HSE, libraries, statutory and voluntary agencies, and so on.  Preschool services are now established in a number of centres with supports and monitoring systems in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">Visual "storyboard" tools have also been developed to facilitate the raising of awareness amongst residents of the RIA's child protection policy.  These tools are now available to direct provision centre staff and other service providers. A programme for non-Irish national parents has been developed by the RIA, and an inter-departmental / inter-agency steering group established to drive this.</p>
            <p eId="para_3084">Funding is also received through the EQUAL programme, aimed at supporting separated children seeking asylum as they "age out".  Such supports include outreach services, mentoring, parent education and other responses to identified need.</p>
            <p eId="para_3085">The RIA is in the process of rolling out a series of training programmes and seminars dealing with issues such as child protection training (in conjunction with the HSE), conflict resolution and anger management and improving service delivery at accommodation centres.  Some of these programmes arise from conclusions reached after a series of three two-day seminars hosted by RIA, held in Tullamore in the past seven months, on ‘Information and Good Practice' which were attended by accommodation centre staff and managers, relevant Government bodies and NGOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3086">In relation to the issue of gender specific violence and torture, asylum seekers residing in the State have access to health services on the same basis as the indigenous population. In addition, there is a dedicated counselling service provided by the HSE in Dublin which specialises in issues related to victims of violence and torture among the asylum seeking population. Newly arrived asylum seekers have access to health screening, general practitioner and public health nursing services as appropriate. Those who are victims of such torture or violence can be referred directly to the counselling service by any of these health service professionals. In addition to the service provided by the HSE, an NGO called SPIRASI provides a comprehensive counselling and medical follow-up service specifically aimed at victims and survivors of torture. The SPIRASI service is funded by the HSE. In all cases, interpretation services can be accessed by relevant service providers in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3087">There is no policy or practice to search asylum seekers on arrival or during their stay in accommodation centres under the Direct Provision system.  Searches may only be carried out by the Garda authorities under the powers vested in them under relevant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3088">No regulations are in existence in relation to the type of clothing that may be worn by asylum seekers residing in the Direct Provision system. Every asylum seeker accommodated by the RIA is provided with a copy of the "Direct Provision Reception &amp; Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures". This booklet is available in 6 languages, including English. The booklet includes information on services provided at centres, House Rules, complaints procedures, child protection and fire safety. There is an implied obligation on residents to wear clothes which do not offend accepted standards of decency or seek to deliberately conceal identity.  I might add that the RIA is unaware of any issues having arisen in this area.   A committee is being set up, involving interested parties such as the Irish Refugee Council, to review the above mentioned Rules and if the issue of clothing standards arises, it will be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_3089">The decision of the Government to introduce direct provision was made against the background of a range of measures taken in other EU countries to control illegal immigration and manage the processing of large numbers of asylum applicants. Whilst no research has been commissioned by the RIA on the direct provision system in this country, the RIA is made aware of reports by NGOs and other interested bodies on various aspects of the system and account is taken of such reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3090">In this context, it is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum matters is by far the best approach. The introduction of direct provision in this country simply brought us in line with other EU Member States, and more particularly with our nearest neighbour, the UK, who introduced a direct provision system in April, 2000. I am satisfied that direct provision is a humane, fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum seeker population. I would strongly contend that the treatment of asylum seekers in this country is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer anywhere in the world.</p>

            <p eId="para_3119">In relation to the issue of closures, the RIA has terminated contracts with 68 centres since its inception. Of these, 21 were effected as part of a downsizing programme when numbers in RIA accommodation were reducing.

            <p eId="para_3120">The Guidelines for a contractor are, in essence, the contract itself. The contract places obligations on the contractor in relation to reception, management and staff issues, menus and food for infants and school-going children, maintenance of the property and fire and safety standards. It is the policy of the RIA to conduct regular comprehensive inspections on properties used to house asylum seekers. These inspections are carried out internally by RIA staff and externally by an independent company with specific expertise in Hazard and Critical Control Point (HACCP) analysis (food and food hygiene) and fire safety standards. In addition, all premises are subject to inspection by the Environmental Health Officer and Fire Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">The contracts entered into by the RIA place obligations on the contractor to ensure that there is a standard of accommodation and service in place. All contractors are obliged to ensure that their premises complies with and operates in accordance with, all relevant statutory requirements of local authorities in relation to planning, building, bye-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_779">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3123">I am confident that asylum applications from people who may have suffered gender specific violence, torture or other traumas are dealt with appropriately and sensitively by properly trained and resourced staff.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act, 1996. The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_3124">The asylum process now in place in the State is comprehensive and compares well with other EU countries.  Indeed this fact was acknowledged by a former UNHCR Representative to Ireland who is quoted as stating that Ireland is now a model for the new Member States of the European Union and that "we now have a system which, in many respects, is one of the best in Europe". The processing of asylum applications is done within the framework of the Refugee Act 1996, under which every asylum applicant, regardless of gender, is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  Each application is assessed comprehensively on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant's own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant's country or place of origin).</p>
            <p eId="para_3125">Our system also guarantees every asylum applicant a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body — the Refugee Appeals Tribunal — as well as guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service.  Interpretation facilities are also provided where necessary and applicants are generally facilitated if they request caseworkers and interpreters of a particular gender because of the often sensitive nature of the matters arising at interview.</p>
            <p eId="para_3126">I am advised that while counsellors are not engaged by the ORAC to deal with asylum applicants who claim to have gone through traumatic events in their country of origin prior to their arrival in the State and/or for applicants who claim to be the survivors of torture, the interviewers in ORAC have received comprehensive and specialised training (as developed in consultation with UNHCR, and in line with international best practice) in relation to interviewing all types of asylum claimants, including survivors of torture, vulnerable groups such as women and children who have been traumatised by gender specific violence and unaccompanied minors and separated children.  In addition, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has provided training and guidance and psychological support to interviewers in ORAC who are dealing with applicants who are the victims of sexual abuse and rape.</p>
            <p eId="para_3127">In addition, ORAC's approach to processing asylum applications relating to gender specific violence is in line with international best practice.  I am also aware of certain NGO groups who provide services and assistance, including counselling to victims of torture.  The State training programmes are delivered by a combination of experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists, asylum experts from other countries, psychologists and other agencies with the specialist skills required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3128">In relation to interpretation, I am advised that asylum applicants are asked when they present at the Office of Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) to make applications for refugee status to outline if they have any special needs with these being noted and female interpreters are provided if they are requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_3129">It is not possible to comment on the internal training provided by the interpretation service provider to their staff. However, I am advised that UNHCR has provided training to interpreters in the past in relation to interpreting with regard to the asylum process.  ORAC also regularly monitors the standard and quality of service provided by its interpretation suppliers  through its internal quality assurance systems and by having regular meetings with the manager of the relevant company to ensure that the interpreters are professional in the course of their duty. The ORAC has developed guidelines relating to the use of interpretation in the ORAC in consultation with UNHCR.</p>

            <p eId="para_3131">The provision of statistics relating to the number of asylum seekers who have been entitled to a rent supplement since the introduction of direct provision is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3132">Statistics in relation to the number of asylum seekers living outside the direct provision system are not readily available.  The provision of services to asylum seekers such as in the areas of health and education are matters for the appropriate Government Departments. In relation to my own Department, I can advise the Deputy that all asylum seekers are entitled to confidential and independent legal advice provided by the Refugee Legal Service and access to interpreters at all stages in the asylum process. In addition, they are provided with direct provision services including full board and accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3133">In relation to unaccompanied minors, under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, where it appears that a person is under the age of 18 years and unaccompanied, the minor must be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) which will then decide whether or not to make an application for asylum on their behalf.  In the event that an application is made, the HSE will then assist the minor throughout the asylum process, including accompanying them to any interview or hearing that may be scheduled.</p>
            <p eId="para_3134">The processing of applications for refugee status from unaccompanied minors has a number of child-specific features and has regard to a number of distinct factors including the UNHCR's Guidelines on Policies and Procedures in dealing with Unaccompanied Children seeking Asylum.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3218">I propose to take Questions Nos. 550, 551 and 574 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced as part of the Government's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The revised schemes are based on the outcome of the review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme which was recently completed within my Department.  The review also incorporated the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3220">Three new schemes are to be introduced, a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, a Mobility Aids Grant Scheme, and a scheme of Housing Aid for Older People.</p>
            <p eId="para_3221">The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The grant will be increased from the current effective maximum of €20,320 to a maximum of €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the cost of works.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of work available to those with annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3222">The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme will provide grants to cover a basic suite of works to address mobility problems, primarily but not exclusively, associated with ageing.  It will fast track limited grant aid to people on lower incomes (maximum annual household income threshold €30,000).  The maximum grant available will be €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">The new Housing Aid for Older People scheme will provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people, and amalgamates the provisions of the existing Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Schemes. The maximum grant available will be €10,500 and may cover 100% of the cost of works for applicants with an annual household income of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">The revised schemes, which will involve a more streamlined operation, are designed to ensure that the available funding is targeted at those most in need and will provide a more seamless set of responses to the needs of older people and people with a disability.  It is expected that the revised schemes will be implemented during 2007 and detailed administrative guidance on the operation of the schemes will be issued to local authorities in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_3235">Under the decentralisation programme, all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met Éireann, ENFO, the Private Rented Tenancies Board and a small co-ordination section which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department's Dáil and other business. A total of 682 Dublin based posts will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).  My Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plans, which are published on the Department's website at www.environ.ie, outline the sections and the overall numbers which are due to decentralise to the respective locations in the South East.  As outlined in the most recent Progress Report (September 2006) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group, the indicative timescales for the completion of the Department's offices in Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford are Quarter 3 2008, End 2008, Quarter 4 2009 and Quarter 3 2010 respectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_3259">I am aware of concerns regarding sequencing difficulties between expiration of planning permissions and timing of grid connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">Firstly, I should point out that, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I am precluded, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, from exercising any power or control in relation to any individual planning application or appeal with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.  Secondly, the granting of grid connections is a matter for the Commissioner for Energy Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3261">Planning permissions are typically granted for a period of 5 years.  I understand that a limited number of applications that received permission in recent years have been affected by the moratorium on grid connections imposed by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation in 2003-2004.  Where planning permissions expire, Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that developers may seek an extension of the appropriate period, subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that substantial works have been carried out by the time of expiration.  It is a matter for planning authorities as to whether these conditions are met in individual circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3262">In addition, I would point out that section 41 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 also provides that planning authorities may grant planning permission for a period longer than the normal 5 years.  Guidelines on Wind Energy Development, published by my Department in June 2006, explicitly encourage planning authorities to use this provision when considering applications for wind energy development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">In relation to development consent provisions in respect of wind energy development, applications for such development are subject to the same planning procedures as other types of development.  Therefore the same requirements in relation to public consultation apply.  Essentially, this means that a prospective developer is required to publish notice in a specified newspaper, as well as a site notice, up to two weeks prior to making an application, giving a brief indication as to the nature and extent of the proposed development and advising that submissions may be made to the planning authority.  Interested parties then have 5 weeks to make a submission once an application for planning permission is made.  As is the case with other classes of development, an applicant for permission, and any person who has made a valid submission or observation on a planning application, may appeal the decision of a planning authority to An Bord Pleanála.</p>

While it is matter for each local authority to determine its domestic allowance, billing guidance issued by the Department in December 2006 recommended the introduction of a domestic allowance of 225 cubic metres or 49,500 gallons in the case of all mixed-use properties.  This would constitute a generous allowance in the context of per capita consumption of water in carrying out normal domestic activities.</p>

The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance which the Local Authority has listed on the Record of Protected Structures under the Planning and Development Act 2000. It is a matter for each individual local authority to assess and prioritise applications within the approved funding.

            <p eId="para_3559">I propose to take Questions Nos. 578 and 579 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3560">Statutory responsibility for protection and improvement of water quality is assigned primarily to local authorities acting under the general supervision of the EPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3561">Measures for the protection and improvement of water quality are being progressed on a systematic basis, particularly within the context of the Water Framework Directive, and I expect that we will see significant improvements in the quality of our fresh and coastal water resources over the coming years. The Water Framework Directive generally provides that there must be no deterioration in the status of any waters and that all waters achieve at least "good status" by 2015. A comprehensive programme of activities is currently underway by my Department, the EPA, local authorities and other relevant bodies for full implementation of the Directive. This is being supported by river basin district projects, led by local authorities, together with a wide range of research and other projects funded under the National Development Plan. My Department has committed 100% funding amounting to some €63 million for most of these activities. INTERREG funding is also being applied in relation to cross-border projects. To date, all implementation deadlines set by the Directive have been achieved on time by Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3562">In June 2007, an overview report was issued for each River Basin District outlining the significant water management issues that have been identified and the possible measures to be taken. These reports will assist the participation of interested parties in the process of developing, by June 2008, draft River Basin Management Plans which will set out the specific environmental objectives to be achieved during the first 6-year plan period (2009-15) together with the programme of measures which will be required to deliver on these objectives. The River Basin Management Plans will be adopted by June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3563">The achievement of improvements in water quality is, and will be, significantly supported by the ongoing investment under the Water Services Investment Programme and by implementation of the Nitrates Action Programme, which are key elements within the overall programme of measures under the Water Framework Directive. Some €2 billion has been invested since 2000 on the provision of new and upgraded waste water services under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme. Significant funding is also being provided by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries under the Farm Waste Management Scheme to support investment by farmers to meet the requirements of the Nitrates Action Programme. Measures are also being developed to strengthen the protection of water quality against pollution from other sources e.g. discharges from local authority waste water treatment plants, forestry or marine installations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3564">Insofar as the question may relate to the quality of drinking water, this is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_3570">I first became aware of my predecessor Minister Roche's recent determination of statutory directions in relation to works of an archaeological nature on the approved route of the M3 motorway when I received a text in the Dail chamber on the evening of Thursday the 14 June. Neither I nor any of my party colleagues had any prior contact with Minister Roche or his Department on this issue. On 15 June 2007, following my appointment as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I examined my Department's file in relation to the directions given to the National Roads Authority (NRA) in respect of the newly discovered national monument at Lismullin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3571">In making the directions the former Minister followed the procedures prescribed under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 2004. These included consultation with the Director of the National Museum. Following receipt of the views of the Director the matter was submitted to my predecessor for a determination in relation to the directions.  I have received unequivocal legal advice from the Attorney General that, without a change in the material circumstances relating to the newly discovered monument, it is not open to me to review, or amend, the directions given by my predecessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3572">A recommendation of the Director of the National Museum that a special committee should be installed to ensure that excavation of the national monument at Lismullin is carried out to the highest and most transparent standard has been accepted and is referred to in the directions. The National Monuments Service of my Department, Dr. Pat Wallace, Director of the National Museum, the National Roads Authority and Professor Gabriel Cooney, Head of the School of Archaeology, UCD are represented on the committee.  At my request, Conor Newman of the Department of Archaeology at NUI, Galway, recognised as an expert on Tara, has also agreed to join the committee.  I recently visited the Tara/Skreen valley with Conor Newman and Dr. Pat Wallace.  The committee has held its first meeting and will continue to advise me on the conduct of the archaeological investigations to be carried out under the statutory directions over the course of the excavation of the monument.</p>

            <p eId="para_3574">During dredging operations undertaken by the Drogheda Port Company in the River Boyne the remains of the submerged wreck of a clinker-built vessel were discovered in November 2006. Preliminary carbon dating of wood samples taken from the wreck indicate that it dates it from the late medieval era. Further dendrochronological analysis of wood samples will more accurately pinpoint the vessel's date and provenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3575">At this juncture the wreck is considered to be not alone of Irish but international significance. It is very rare to discover an intact wreck of this period and type in Irish or European waters. In addition to the vessel itself, related equipment has been found including a well preserved pulley block and mast-step, the remains of some 13 cargo barrels and some private items belonging to the crew such as a wooden drinking vessel. The wreck of the vessel is considered, by virtue of age, uniqueness and potential significance, to be a national monument and the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004 apply to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3576">The excavation, recording and recovery of the vessel commenced in January 2007 and is currently nearing completion. This highly delicate and skilled archaeological operation is contingent on weather and tidal conditions and has been undertaken by my Department with the logistical support of Drogheda Port Company and the conservation expertise of the National Museum of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3577">Upon recovery, a major conservation programme, to be undertaken by the National Museum of Ireland, will need to be put in place. It is only at this stage that the full import and value of the wreck in archaeological terms can be properly evaluated. Pending a full scientific post-excavation report on the vessel, I intend to issue interim preliminary reports for the public giving as much information on this significant discovery as possible.  In this context my Department has also commissioned documentary filming of the wreck discovery, excavation and recovery operation.</p>

The Electoral Amendment Act 2001 provided improved powers to university constituency registration officers to revise and update the registers, which has resulted in greater accuracy of the university constituencies' registers of electors. However, the registration officers still depend to a significant degree on the co-operation of the public in order to maintain the registers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3594">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3595">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities under the Regional Broadband Programme.  Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Managed Services Entity.  Wexford town received a 22 km MAN under the first phase of towns and cities to receive broadband infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3596">Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the Regional Broadband Programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  The procurement process for the Government's new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was launched on 2 May 2007.  This scheme will provide broadband services to the areas of Ireland that are currently unserved and ensure that every reasonable request for broadband in these unserved areas is met.  The estimated timescale for the award of the NBS contract is December 2007, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen Service Provider.</p>

            <p eId="para_3598">The Programme for Government confirms that we will transfer ownership of the transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid by end 2008.  High oil and gas prices worldwide are a reality with which Ireland, as price taker, has to contend.  About 70% of the costs of generating electricity here are driven by international trends, our location and transportation costs.  However, the remaining 30% of costs are a result of domestically controllable factors and are high by international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">The transfer of the transmission (Grid) ownership from ESB Group to EirGrid is a key action in the delivery of healthy competition and consumer choice in the electricity market.  Quantification of the benefits of the Government's policy actions, in terms of electricity prices for consumers, will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in its annual price review but it is quite clear that transparency in relation to access to the Grid and Transmission assets will attract more players into the market and help to stimulate competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">The ESB Group will remain a strong, commercially viable and fully integrated entity after the transmission asset ownership moves to EirGrid.  In fact ESB will be even better positioned to deliver on its mandate in the distribution, power generation and supply sectors on a level playing field and to play a leading role in the development of new renewable electricity supplies and energy saving technologies.  ESB International will be strongly growing its UK, European and international business. ESB Group will continue to compete successfully with Viridian, Airtricity and other independents in power-generation and electricity supply in the all-island electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3601">It is my view that any transactional costs inherent in the transfer process will not result in greater costs to the consumer.  The Deloitte analysis considered that the transfer of the Transmission Asset Ownership function should not create a material cost.  Nor will the transfer of ownership of the national grid transmission assets from ESB Group to EirGrid have negative implications for jobs, pay and conditions for ESB or EirGrid workers.  I have already confirmed my commitment to working with ESB and EirGrid management and unions, as well as the ESB ESOT as minority Shareholder in the ESB Group, to ensure satisfactory outcomes which address legitimate concerns in the process of achieving the transfer of transmission asset ownership to EirGrid by end 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3604">The Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) support programme replaces  a competitive tendering based programme, which operated during the previous decade to support the construction of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants.

The REFIT support programme is new and is awaiting state aids clearance from the EU Commission before it can be put into effect.  My Department will monitor its effectiveness once it is put into effect.  However, it is premature to suggest a further alternative support mechanism or change to the proposed programme until it has operated for an initial period, at least.</p>

            <p eId="para_3606">District heating can play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gases and promoting sustainable development.  It is influenced by a range of factors, including environmental conditions, availability of heat sources and suitable markets.  The systems used to provide district heating fall into two broad categories — dedicated central boilers or power stations using Combined Heat and Power (CHP).</p>
            <p eId="para_3607">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has funded district heating systems under its House of Tomorrow programme.  The Renewable Heat (ReHeat) and CHP Programmes, also provide assistance for the deployment of renewable heating systems in industrial, commercial, public and community premises.  The use of power stations for the provision of district heating depends on a range of factors including the relationship between power demand and heat demand, particularly outside of the heating season. The district receiving the heat is generally located within a couple of kilometres of the power station.</p>
            <p eId="para_3608">In relation to the specific use of the 150MW peat-fired West Offaly Power station at Lanesboro, Co. Offaly, I would point out that this plant is owned and operated by the ESB.  All operational matters, including the question of supplying a district heating system from the station, are matters that fall within the day-to-day responsibility of the company and not ones in which I have a function.  Therefore, any undertaking of a feasibility study into the development of a district heating system at West Offaly Power would require, in the first instance, the submission of a proposal by the company to SEI.</p>

         the full circumstances and timetable of the way CER and his Department arrived at the decision to sanction the ESB to build and operate the new generation plant at Aghada, County Cork; his views on the serious allegations that his Department delayed this decision in such a way as to cost the ESB and the Exchequer an additional €100 million plus in construction and start-up costs;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3614">Authorisation of ESB's construction of a 430MW Combine Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant at Aghada was granted by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), in the context of the CER-ESB Asset Management Strategy Agreement of 29 November 2006 on reducing ESB's dominance in power generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3615">Ministerial approval for Capital Expenditure was considered by my predecessor, Minister Noel Dempsey and the Department in the context of the range of relevant issues and was granted contingent on ESB's compliance with the terms and conditions of the CER-ESB Agreement to the full satisfaction of the CER, on its establishment and operation as a fully ring-fenced subsidiary separate from ESB Power Generation in terms of licensing and business separation and on the condition that the output be sold to suppliers other than ESB Power Electricity Supply.  There was no unnecessary or intentional delay to the granting of approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_3616">The estimated cost of ESB's construction of its new plant at Aghada reflects a fundamental shift in worldwide market dynamics for CCGT plant, fuelled by rising commodity prices for speciality steels and other prefabricated materials, in addition to increasing labour costs.  The availability of engineering resources is also becoming a limiting factor restricting suppliers' ability to scale up production to meet the increasing demand. This shift is a worldwide phenomenon and is not restricted to projects in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3617">Prior to receiving Ministerial approval for the relevant capital expenditure on the Aghada project, ESB gave clear assurances that it had independently validated this upward movement in commodity prices and labour costs as part of its contract negotiation process and that it had satisfied itself that the cost of the power plant in Aghada reflects current global market prices and represents the best value for money outcome in difficult power plant market circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_3619">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3620">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities under the Regional Broadband Programme.  Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Managed Services Entity.  The second phase will extend the programme and in this regard my Department is currently constructing a 5.2 km MAN in Kilrush in association with Shannon Broadband Limited, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3621">Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the Regional Broadband Programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  The procurement process for the Government's new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was launched on 2 May 2007.  This scheme will provide broadband services to the areas of Ireland that are currently unserved and ensure that every reasonable request for broadband in these unserved areas is met.  The estimated timescale for the award of the NBS contract is December 2007, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen Service Provider.</p>
