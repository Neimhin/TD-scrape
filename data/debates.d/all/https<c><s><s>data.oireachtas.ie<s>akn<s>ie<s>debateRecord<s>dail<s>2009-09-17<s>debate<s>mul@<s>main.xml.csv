I express the hope that it will find its visit enjoyable, successful and to our mutual benefit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Yesterday the Minister for Finance outlined the details of the NAMA legislation.  I thank him, his staff and advisers, as well as the Attorney General and his officials, for the huge volume of work they have put into the Bill.  I also thank the Cabinet for its input and guidance, as well as those who have offered many constructive suggestions.As many have commented, this legislation is one of the most important economic Bills to come before the House since independence.  Therefore, it is vital that it is debated thoroughly, not only in order that Deputies can have their say but also in order that the taxpaying public can understand with clarity the decisions we propose to take on their behalf.I want to spend a moment outlining to the Dáil and the people the context in which this is happening and the role the Bill plays in the Government's overall strategy for recovery.  As everyone knows, we are going through difficult times.  However, we cannot be blinded by the difficulties and we must have courage.  We must act.  We must take the future into our own hands and not wait until fate decides it for us.  Doing nothing is not an option.  We must move on.  During this critical period for the country I want the people to know that we can take actions to improve our situation and increase our chances of returning to prosperity.  We intend to take those actions.Between now and Christmas the country has the opportunity to take three steps that will lay the foundations for recovery.  These steps are the passing of the Lisbon treaty to give us a stronger and more efficient European Union with Ireland influencing and shaping events that affect us; the setting up of the National Asset Management Agency which will help to solve the banking crisis; and the passing of a budget which will continue the process of putting the public finances back on a sustainable footing in the coming years.  It is my belief and that of the Government that these three measures will position Ireland to benefit from the recovery we are beginning to see in other countries far sooner than would otherwise be the case.  Of course, it is difficult but we must confront the scale of the problems and be confident that together we will pull through for the sake of the country's future prospects.  It is also my strong belief that by not passing these three measures we would be condemning ourselves to a period of stagnation, isolation and further deterioration in our economic circumstances.  Let us proceed with determination and the courage of our convictions that we will all do what is necessary now to secure our economic future.On all three issues, the Lisbon treaty, NAMA and the upcoming budget, there is one sole motivation guiding the Government, namely, to return the country to growth as soon as possible for the benefit of us all.  These issues cannot be resolved in isolation.  In tackling the issues facing the economy, the stabilisation and cleansing of our banking and financial system is not optional.  It is a must.  To protect jobs we need an economy that is growing.  An economy cannot grow without a properly working banking system.  After careful consideration of all the options, we believe establishing the National Asset Management Agency is the best solution to the banking crisis that Ireland faces.  By establishing the agency the Government is tackling head on the significant threat impaired assets pose to the Irish financial system.  The asset management approach has a proven track record internationally and the establishment of NAMA has been supported by institutions such as the IMF and the European Central Bank, as well as by the financial markets.  Deputy Bruton stated last night that the ECB had recommended paying the market price for assets.  This is not true.  It recommended that we avoid paying too great a premium over the market price.  As the Minister pointed out yesterday, the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. John Hurley, and the incoming Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, have both stated that, having regard to the uncertainty in property price movements, the proposed add-on of 15% to 18% to the estimated current market price does not seem out of proportion with the range of potential upward price movements, especially when a risk sharing element is included.  I am absolutely certain that the proposed premium over market price is in the best interests of the economy and, consequently, those of the taxpayer.Last night the Minister outlined in significant detail how NAMA would operate.  I would like to address some of the key points of NAMA's operation, while also setting out the broader context for this initiative.  Members of the House should be familiar with the context for this debate but judging by some of the contributions yesterday it is worth reminding ourselves of the events of the past 12 months.  As a consequence of international developments and our own domestic factors, the need for extensive Government support and protection for the Irish banking sector became clear.  During that period, Governments and central banks across the globe have provided substantial support to the financial sector and the broad economy in their management of this global crisis.I want to highlight the importance of a functioning banking system to the wider economy and the steps the Government has taken to promote lending.  Promoting lending to the small and medium-size enterprise sector is a high priority for the Government and a number of initiatives are already under way to support viable but vulnerable businesses.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Government's existing recapitalisation package includes a number of measures to boost lending and underpin economic activity.  These measures include a commitment by the two main banks to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises this year by 10% over last year's levels, and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers this year.  The Financial Regulator is monitoring compliance with these lending targets.  Furthermore, AIB and Bank of Ireland have each created funds to support projects which have a positive impact on the environment or will provide innovation in clean energy and have committed to seed capital funds, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland, to support further the creation and development of new enterprises.These various credit supply initiatives will be underpinned by the new statutory code of conduct for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Mortgage lending will be supported by the new statutory code of conduct for mortgage lending, which requires that a lender will not initiate legal proceedings for repossession within six months of arrears appearing — although the two recapitalised banks, AIB and BOI, have agreed to a 12-month wait.  I reject the suggestion by Deputy Burton that these banks are lining up repossessions for next year.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	8	——and it is unfair to working families facing financial difficulties to continually suggest that this is the case.  Of course, difficulties must be monitored and worked through, but I do not agree with the contention that was made yesterday.There have been moves in a number of countries to remove the impact of impaired loans or other toxic assets from the balance sheets of banks so that they can more easily secure funding and, hopefully, equity investment.  One of the main approaches has been what is sometimes called the "bad bank" model — although in reality it could better be called an asset management model — where a special vehicle is set up to hold damaged assets and seek to recover value.The option that my Government has agreed on goes further as it also includes performing loans.  It is projected that 36% of the assets will be land, 28% development property and 36% associated commercial loans.  The estimate is that 40% of these loans are cash-flow producing.  The cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the NAMA bonds and operating costs.  Therefore, citizens will not have to pay for the running of NAMA on a day-to-day basis.The asset management agency is the next step in ensuring that we have a banking system that is fit for purpose and can support economic recovery.  NAMA will buy the land and development property loans and certain associated loans from the banks at significantly reduced prices.  It will then manage these loans over time to achieve the best possible return for the taxpayer.  The asset management agency will start with the largest systemic exposures across the institutions and it is expected that by the middle of next year most of the loans will be transferred.  NAMA will leave behind smaller but stronger banks that can focus their resources on their core function of lending to Irish business.It is important to point out yet again that the Government's decision to establish this agency was taken following expert advice from at home and abroad and before we made our decision, we listened in detail to the advice of the NTMA, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and our financial and legal advisers.The Government is convinced that the asset management agency approach is the most appropriate to the Irish situation.  Moreover, since the decision to establish NAMA was announced, it has received endorsements from many different quarters, including bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.All that said, there is an understandably high level of anger and dismay among the public at the way in which some of our financial institutions have operated in recent years.  People naturally look at the significant financial supports that the Government has had to put in place to address the difficulties in the banks.  The Government shares this sense of dismay and disappointment and is determined that enhanced financial regulation should stamp out bad practices for good in future.If there is one message I want the House and the citizens of this State to be absolutely clear about it is that NAMA is not designed to be or will not be permitted to operate in practice as a bailout mechanism for anybody who has operated irresponsibly.  In relation to those who took out these development related loans, the agency will continue to treat them as borrowers who continue to owe the full amount of their loan.  Under the Bill the agency will have a duty to maximise taxpayer returns and the Government expects the agency will use the range of powers available to it under the Bill to meet that objective.  To be clear on this point, anyone whose bank loan is purchased by this agency will have to repay NAMA just as he or she would have had to repay the bank originally.In relation to the banks, the Bill includes a risk-sharing mechanism with the banks that will protect the taxpayer from over-paying for the assets to be transferred to the agency.  The Bill provides that if the agency should make a loss in any given year, it will have the option of not paying any interest or coupon payment on the debt concerned.  This has the effect of encouraging the financial institution involved to work to ensure that the agency does not finish up in a loss-making position.The Minister for Finance has dealt in detail with the valuation of the loan assets but I propose to say a few words on this important issue.  Every loan will undergo a detailed assessment in accordance with the valuation methodology set out in the Bill and this method of valuation must be approved by the European Commission.  The Opposition seems unable to understand, or unwilling to acknowledge, that not all loans will be paid for at a premium to market value.  The Minister for Finance has repeatedly explained that some speculative land purchases will now have reverted to agricultural value and the loans on these lands are unlikely to be worth more than agricultural value even over the seven to ten years that we expect NAMA to operate.  I assure the House that no premium will be paid on these loans.  As I have said, the loans will be individually valued and the question of whether a premium is appropriate will be considered on a case-by-case basis.Our preliminary aggregate estimates outlined by the Minister for Finance yesterday indicate that the asset management agency will pay €54 billion for loans with a book value of €77 billion.  This represents a substantial discount and ensures that only a modest recovery in property prices is necessary for the agency to break even over time.  The success of the agency is in no way dependent on a return to so-called bubble prices.I want to tackle head on this notion being peddled by the Opposition that we are mortgaging our children's future.  This is a misrepresentation of the facts and is using fear for political gain.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Let me be clear about this, taking the subordinated debt into account, NAMA will have to achieve less than a 10% uplift over the current market values on its assets over ten years to break even.  Any increase above this would accrue in its entirety to the taxpayer so the suggestion by Deputy Mitchell last evening that NAMA offers no possibility of a gain to the taxpayer is wrong.  Finally, I refer to Deputy Burton's request for the publication of a business plan that would set out the cost of the agency's operations.  I can confirm that such a plan will be provided before the end of Second Stage of the Bill.There has been detailed discussion and commentary in the media on potential alternatives to the asset management approach and the establishment of this agency.  Deputy Bruton's alternatives are premised on significant levels of default on Irish bank debt.  This would have a severe detrimental effect on the remaining banks and, most importantly, the State's ability to fund itself.  The Government does not believe the best interests of the State are served by allowing a culture of default or potential default to develop.  This would undermine financial stability and result in the need for further action to rescue the banking system.  The suggestion by Deputy Bruton that we can divide most or all of our banks into a good and bad bank system without disrupting the flow of finance to the economy is totally unrealistic in our view and not founded in any practical plan.  If, as suggested, all or most of our banks were to be put into a bank resolution scheme we would be left for a significant period with zombie banks and very little lending into the Irish economy.

Shareholders in these banks have already lost much of the value in their investment as shares have fallen over 90% from their peak.  If State capital is needed after the transfer of loans to NAMA, it will be in the form of equity capital thereby increasing the Government's shareholding further.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	22	This was organised in such a way that no event of default arose — the bondholders were given a choice.  The buy backs by the three largest banks have resulted in losses of almost €4 billion from face value for those bondholders and resulted in accounting gains for the financial institutions.  That has increased their core capital putting them in a better position to absorb the discount which will arise when the loans are transferred to the asset management agency.An important point I should make is that the bulk of bonds in issue by Irish banks are not subordinated debt but are debt of a far more fundamental character.  They are often purchased by pension funds or insurers who are not natural high-risk takers.  Another suggestion is that the Government could nationalise the banks and the financial system's problems would possibly disappear.  This is patently untrue.  Impaired assets still would have to be dealt with and the shareholders in AIB and Bank of Ireland would have to be compensated to the tune, perhaps, of more than €5 billion.Deputy Burton stated yesterday that her party is not in favour of blanket nationalisation and I welcome that clarification.  The Government favoured nationalisation where that was the best solution available at the time, as in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.  Furthermore, we have repeatedly said that if the State needs to put further capital into the other banks, it will be done by way of equity, thereby increasing the State's holding.The measures undertaken by EU Governments have been designed and implemented within a common EU framework.  I have already referred to the undoubted benefits that membership of the eurozone has brought in tackling the current crisis, in particular the support to Irish financial institutions from the European Central Bank, ECB.  The Government has also benefited from the template for impaired asset schemes drawn up by the EU Commission which will help to ensure that the NAMA provisions will be fully consistent with relevant state aid provisions of the treaty.The Government is determined to ensure that the regulatory framework for financial services in Ireland meets the Government's objectives for the maintenance of the stability of the financial system, for effective and efficient supervision of the financial sector and for safeguarding the interests of consumers.  Meeting this objective necessitates a new approach, involving new standards in banking regulation, new standards of corporate governance, and the integration of Central Bank responsibilities with the regulatory and supervisory functions.The Government has agreed significant and comprehensive changes to the institutional structures for financial regulation which are consistent with the emerging international agenda for reform in the financial services sector.  The key element of the new structure is the establishment of an independent central banking commission.  The central banking commission will be chaired by the Governor and will be a single integrated structure combining the existing role of the Central Bank board with responsibility for the prudential supervision of financial institutions, which is currently the role of the Financial Regulator.  The Government is determined that these structural changes will be supported with new resources, skill sets and expertise, that will underpin the restoration of confidence in our regulatory arrangements.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is a priority for the Government to ensure that the membership of the new structure is highly authoritative, expert and experienced in all of the key areas required for it to effectively discharge its responsibilities.  As Members are aware, the Government has already announced the appointment of Professor Patrick Honohan as governor.  A director of financial supervision will be appointed in the coming weeks.  This person will be a high calibre individual with a high level of expertise and market knowledge and extensive experience.  The Government considers this is essential for the rebuilding of confidence in the reputation of the Irish financial regulatory system.These reform measures will include strengthening corporate governance in the banking sector through, for example, a prohibition on chief executives moving directly into the role of chairman, and limiting cross directorships.  Every analysis of the financial crisis has pointed to the vital importance of trust and confidence in financial services and the profound impact of the decline of these essential ingredients.  The reform of the institutional structures for financial regulation announced by the Government will underpin confidence in our financial system as well as helping to enhance the flow of credit in the economy.

They have ignored the very real risk to the taxpayer that the economy is paralysed by banks which are unable to lend. I believe that the passing of the National Asset Management Agency Bill is absolutely vital if our economy is to recover in the coming years and if we are to defeat the scourge of unemployment that is blighting so many lives in the country today.  Passing the legislation will cleanse the balance sheets of the Irish banks and so enable them to increase the provision of credit which is their core role in the economy.  Along with the other initiatives that this Government has taken over the past year with regard to restoring competitiveness and bringing order to the public finances, it will bring us a long way towards positioning ourselves to take the earliest possible advantage of the global economic recovery when it takes hold.I commend this legislation to the House.

The decisions taken over the next few weeks will impact not just on this generation but on those to come.  The stakes could not be higher.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	31	In a few weeks the people will vote on the Lisbon treaty.  This party believes passionately in the interests of our country and for that reason we have set aside any narrow political considerations in campaigning actively for a "Yes" vote.  Let me be clear.  With the same passion and sense of conviction we believe that the NAMA proposal is not in the national interest and that is why we are voting against it.  This is not just a flawed item of legislation.  It is the economics of the madhouse, supported by the fiction of long-term economic value.The Government keeps telling us that this is not a bail out for the bankers.  In fact the Taoiseach gets quite annoyed when he hears talk of bail outs.  Perhaps the Government, then, should explain why the share price of AIB is up 25% this morning and the share price of Bank of Ireland is up 16%.  Is that not a very clear sign indeed that this is a great deal for the banks at the expense of the taxpayer?Since the beginning of this year there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to the financial markets.  The State has guaranteed the banks and pumped €7 billion into the system.  The result is that since April senior bank bonds have increased in value by about20%, subordinated bonds have increased by 50% and shares that were worth ten cent are now valued at €3.20 with targets being set at €5 or thereabouts.  The Government wants us to believe that it makes sense for this State to fork out billions of euro to overpay for toxic assets.  The Minister claims that all NAMA needs is a 10% bounce in property prices for it to break even.  However, this only holds true if the toxic assets of the banks have been correctly valued and if we are at the lowest point of the property market.  The Minister says the advice cannot be changed, but its interpretation certainly can.If property prices seem to have bottomed out, as the Taoiseach seems to assume, where are all the buyers?  Where are the cash-rich pension funds, swooping to pick up the bargains that lie around?  They are nowhere to be seen.  The Taoiseach bases his assumptions on a modest recovery, but he simply does not know what the future holds, in that regard.  A recent article in The Irish Times by Professor Morgan Kelly for whom I have great expect, clearly illustrates why buyers are holding on to their cash.  As the professor was one of the few commentators to predict the current collapse in the property market, people would be very foolish to ignore his warnings.  According to Professor Kelly, when the bubble burst on Irish agricultural land in the 1970s, real prices fell by a massive 75% and stayed at that level for 18 years.  Based on that experience, and on what happened to the Japanese property market in the 1980s, Professor Kelly gives a clear warning that NAMA could generate multi-billion losses for the taxpayer.  I respect his opinion.The Minister seems to believe that because rents are still high in Ireland, property prices are set to increase.  He should go out on the street and ask people.  Can I suggest to the Minister that it could also mean that rents have further to fall?  We know that Irish rents are still very expensive by European standards.  We also know that more than 30% of commercial property in this city is empty, while interest rates and unemployment are set to increase.  So which is more likely, a rise in property prices or a fall in rents?The Minister told the House that NAMA would apply a 30% discount, on average, to the loans that it is purchasing from the banks.  He did not tell us, however, what the discount is for each individual bank, which is fundamental.  Can the Minister tell us the discounts being applied to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland?  Do they have discounts lower than 30%?  If so, what is the discount that is being applied?  I ask the Minister to indicate to the House how much further recapitalisation will be required at Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, following his statement on NAMA yesterday.  I hope that detailed responses will be given on both issues.  What further money will the taxpayer need to fork out here?Despite the many uncertainties and this being the biggest gamble of the century, the Government has still decided that the only way to solve the banking crisis is to place almost all of the risk on the shoulders of the people.  They might not see it yet because these are paper transactions and it is being sucked away out of the system without it being visible to them.  In contrast, the Minister intends to allow the investors and speculators who funded the property bubble to scuttle away from their responsibilities.  This is why share prices have zoomed following the Minister's statement.  All this comes from a party that continues to lecture the rest of us on patriotism.The sad thing is that senior members of the Government believe what they are saying on NAMA.  They are so cut off from the real world that they have ended up swallowing this fiction.  When the Taoiseach looks in the mirror in the morning, he probably sees a man who thinks he is doing what is right.  The rest of us see a Taoiseach whose policies helped destroy our economy in a Government which refuses to apologise and which keeps making the same mistakes.  The Taoiseach said it is a gamble or do nothing.  He had the privilege of sitting in the Department of Finance for four years when nothing was done, despite the fact that almost 1,000 people work in the regulator's office and the Central Bank.  Advice was available to him not only from at home but also from abroad about the dangers that lay ahead and yet nothing was done.  He now tells us that it is a gamble of €54 billion or do nothing.

Fianna Fáil is no longer the party of the ordinary people; it is the party of the establishment.  It is easy to be brave when taking away €10 million for cervical cancer vaccination or medical cards from pensioners.  However, when it comes to standing up against the elite and the vested interests it has caved in completely.  This money is being sucked out of the system without the public seeing it.  It is not as if NAMA were to tax child benefit or whatever else.  The people will be on the streets when its impact hits home.I wish to say something about the Green Party, the junior member in Government.  If its Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Ryan, vote in favour of NAMA, they are sending out a message that in this Republic the people of influence and money continue to rule.  The Green Party spent the last week telling anyone who would listen that it had effected major changes in the draft legislation.  It did so with great enthusiasm and exuberance.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, claimed that the Government had agreed on "equal sharing of the risk between NAMA and the banks", in other words, 50:50.  Yesterday, we saw what those fine words mean in practice.  The value of the subordinated bonds which will be offered to the banks, under NAMA's risk-sharing mechanism, amounts to 5% of the total price.  Somewhere along the way, a zero went missing.  If anyone finds it, send it to the Green Party promptly.The Green Party also told us last week, with barely concealed excitement, that there was going to be a social dividend.  What it meant, of course, is the State will vastly overpay for land which it may then make available to local communities.  If the Green Party wants to make community pitches available, why can the Government not buy it at market value now instead of paying over the price for land that could be transferred to communities?

If its members decide to vote for this legislation they are sending out a message that they too are part of the elite, the establishment and the powerful.  Are the interests of bank investors and developers really more important than the interests of ordinary people from whom Green Party members have become removed?  We are constantly being told by the Government that there is no alternative to NAMA.  The same line is repeated in certain quarters of the media and by the hired guns.  This is absolutely untrue.  What is true is that the Government has refused to consider any alternative.Let us not forget the origins of NAMA.  I would like the Minister to clarify a point on which I am unclear.  If this was the biggest financial crisis to have hit the country one would have thought that the Government would either have called in the parties to advise them of the scale of the problem we had——

The Minister for Finance appointed one single person to draft a report on this — a stockbroker turned property developer.  On the basis of that 11-page report, which I have not seen and in respect of which I have no knowledge what other input from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the regulator or other economic commentators were added, the Minister has proceeded down the road of introducing this NAMA legislation.  It was done on the evidence and report of a single consultant who I have heard made references to coastal erosion in Longford in a draft of a report published a number of years ago.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On the basis of this report the people were informed we were proceeding with NAMA.  If it was not all so tragic it would be farcical.  I would like the Minister to produce the evidence of how that 11-page report was treated, the consultations that were held on it, the discussions and the interpretation that has resulted in proposing the introduction of NAMA.  In order to understand the basic thinking behind the NAMA structure, we need only go back to what the Taoiseach said in a radio interview some time ago: "The Government has to write whatever cheques are necessary in the interest of maintaining financial stability".  In all my years in this House I have never heard such an irresponsible statement.  No wonder the share prices and bond prices of the banks have rocketed in recent months.  The financial markets are not stupid.  They know when Government interferes here, there is money to be made and that is what they are doing.  They know an easy mark when they see it.  Instead of defending the interests of the Irish people, the Taoiseach has waved the financial flag of surrender.  Stockbrokers this morning must feel as though they are getting all their bonuses at once.  I can almost hear the clink of champagne glasses as the markets toast the long and healthy life of a Government that has caved in to their demands.Whatever way one looks at it, NAMA is an appalling solution to an economic collapse overseen and orchestrated by the two parties in Government.  The IMF has confirmed that Ireland is suffering from the worst economic crisis of any of the industrialised nations.  Countries that used to look upon us with envy now look upon us with pity.  As I have pointed out before, German, French and British newspaper headlines proclaim the end of their recession.  They have moved on.  In Ireland, however, the headlines are about job losses, worsening Government finances and increasing social misery; and now we face the nightmare scenario of rising interest rates while we are stuck at the bottom of the economic cycle.It is exactly 12 months since the bank guarantee, which this party supported in the interest of having a vibrant and competitive banking sector, was put in place by the Government.  Over these 12 months the Government has increased the tax burden considerably but failed to stop the rise in public spending, as was pointed out so clearly by Colm McCarthy on many occasions.  In the same time unemployment has increased massively without any real jobs package from the Government.  The Government has talked about credit flowing but nothing has happened, despite the State's injection of €7 billion into the banks.  We have had 12 months of delay, failure and uncertainty.After all this, we are asked to trust NAMA.  Why should we, given the Government's record?  Only a few weeks ago, the Minister told us the loan-to-value ratio of the transferred loans was 75%; in other words, there was a 25% equity cushion.  Yesterday we learned that the true figure is 88%.  What other figures is the Minister getting wrong?  Are we supposed to trust the bankers?  I will give an example.  I am not a banker and have little involvement with the banks.  God knows, my account is overdrawn most of the time.  However, I went to meet with representatives of the banks last year with Deputy Bruton and some of our economic people.  We had some straightforward discussion with them.  I sat in the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank in St. Stephen's Green for two hours and was given a superb presentation by the former chief executive, whose salary was of the order of €3 million.  That person said to me that every single loan was individually assessed.  Where did I hear that yesterday?  From the Minister for Finance, who said every loan was subject to individual evaluation.  I sat in that office and was told there was nothing wrong with Anglo Irish Bank, that there were no speculative runs or overhangs, that there were no transfers of money between that bank and Irish Nationwide, and that there were not people in that bank who had been allocated €30 million in bank shares to get over the overhang problem.  Before we left, I asked whether there was anything else we should know about this bank, and I was told there was nothing wrong with it; it was the strongest bank in the world.

John Kenneth Galbraith said that these were the guardians of the nation's financial pessimism.  Boards of banks do not know what is going on because when they meet for their two-hour meeting once a month or every two months, most of them do not have the information to ask the relevant questions.  We are now faced with a small group from the National Treasury Management Agency, transferred into NAMA, being placed in charge of the largest property portfolio in the world.  I realise the Minister must set out a whole series of questions about these loans, but if he does not put in people of real competence in this field, we will be going down a dangerous road.  That is my experience with bankers at the highest level in this country.  If they decide to tell the major Opposition party a whole series of untruths — because there is another word I cannot use here — that speaks for itself in terms of the trust we are expected to have.The points that have been made by Deputy Bruton for many years are as relevant now as they were then.  I acknowledge the respect and international standing of people such as Dermot Desmond, who I know sent his proposals for dealing with this issue to the Department of Finance more than six months ago.  These were in many ways parallel to what Fine Gael has proposed——

We would not set up a quango.  If the Taoiseach says people who are opposed to NAMA are either unwilling or unable to understand what is going on, I refer him to the likes of Dermot Desmond or Professor Morgan Kelly or anybody else who has put forward an objective view on how this might be achieved.Fine Gael is opposed to NAMA on principle because it is fundamentally unfair.  Basic fairness would dictate that those who took the risks and were paid to do so should not now be bailed out by the taxpayer.  If one was responsible for the boom in the banks, one must be accountable for their bust.  It does not matter whether one is a shareholder, a bondholder or a developer.  We are also opposed to NAMA because international experience shows it will not work for the taxpayer.  The Government likes to quote the IMF when it suits its purposes.  However, an IMF study in 2008 concluded that "government–owned asset management companies appear largely ineffective in resolving distressed assets, largely due to political and legal constraints".  Proof positive of this comes from France in the 1990s, where a NAMA-type asset management company purchased €28 billion of distressed assets from Crédit Lyonnais, resulting in an €18 billion loss for the State.  Is it any wonder the French have opted for a different model in 2008?  Their model is similar to Fine Gael's proposed alternative to NAMA.The proposal is based on two core principles: we need to get credit flowing quickly by establishing a national recovery bank; and we need to restructure the existing banks to place the risk with the shareholders and bondholders rather than with the people.  It is unclear from yesterday's announcement whether the existing banks will be in a position to resume normal lending if NAMA is established.  What is the position of Anglo Irish Bank, which is a property-based bank?  If these assets are to be acquired at a discount, how is it expected to trade its way out of the difficulty in which it finds itself?  I would like to hear an answer to that question.  Given that it will be many months before the loans are acquired by NAMA, the likelihood is that the banks will continue to hoard their cash, whatever the Government says.The national recovery bank proposed by Fine Gael is designed to inject cash rapidly and effectively into the economy.  I bet the Minister that every single Deputy can give him umpteen examples of small businesses all over the country who are not getting overdrafts or credit and, as a consequence, are unable to continue in business.  By this time next year, how many more thousands of people will be out of work because businesses will have closed down due to the lack of available credit?

To finance itself, the SFEF issued €5 billion of bonds on 1 November.  One month later, it issued a further €6 billion of bonds, and according to SFEF, the second issue was over-subscribed by 50%.  In other words, investors were so keen to invest in the French recovery bank that they could not all be accommodated.

Although the details are not the same, our proposal is broadly parallel to that put forward by Dermot Desmond in the newspapers yesterday.If individual banks make progress we could, under the Fine Gael proposal, inject capital into them to aid a return to financial health.  If they have not made adequate progress, particularly in renegotiating the terms of their loans with the bondholders, we would nationalise an individual bank and separate it into a good and a bad bank.  We will place all of the equity capital and subordinated — or high-risk — bonds into the bad bank, along with the worst developer loans.  The good bank, free of the worst of the debt, could trade normally and would be re-floated in the market when it made financial sense.  If individual good banks make progress, under the Fine Gael proposal, we could inject capital into them to aid a return to financial health.  If they have not made adequate progress, particularly in renegotiating the terms of their loans with the bondholders, we would, under the plan, nationalise individual banks and separate them into a good bank and a bad bank. We would place all the equity capital and subordinated high risk bonds into the bad bank along with the worst developer loans.  The good bank, free of the worst of the debt, could trade normally.  It could be refloated in the market when it would make financial sense to do so.The Government claims that these proposals are untried and would somehow deny Ireland access to the capital markets.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out and as referred to by the Taoiseach, investment in markets did not close as a consequence of what happened in the case of the US Government in terms of Washington Mutual or in the case of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley in England.My message today is that the time for spinning is over.  NAMA is secretive, politically driven and a politically directed workout for banks, developers and speculators.  It will do nothing to get credit flowing to business when we want to do so now.  It is the highest cost and the highest risk solution for the Irish taxpayer and, above all, it is deeply unfair.The Taoiseach asked last night whether NAMA is a gamble and he replied that the only gamble was if nothing was done.  For four years prior to becoming Taoiseach, he sat in Merrion Street and knew the projections that were being made, yet nothing was done by him, as Minister for Finance, or by the Government, of which he is now leader, to stop this.  With all the evidence and information that was flowing into Merrion Street and if patriotism and standing by their country was foremost in those people's minds, then surely action could and should have been taken long before now.  However, I suppose it goes back to the Taoiseach's belief of loyalty to the party first and loyalty to the country second.How can the Taoiseach ask his party and the Irish people to make sacrifices in the forthcoming budget if he is not prepared to insist that the banks and their investors assume their fair share of risk?  I recognise that we are faced with the political reality of the NAMA legislation as being the option under debate.  I ask the Minister again to open his mind to alternatives that exist which will not strangle the Irish taxpayer, that will allow for fairness and real risk sharing and will create a situation, through a national recovery bank, where credit can flow to business now.Every Deputy in the House can point out what has happened in the case of business people in their constituencies.  I know of a case last week where a man received €45,000 for a job he completed.  He put that money into his current account to pay his workers their wages but the cheques bounced.  When he went to his bank to ask what had happened he was told that the bank has offset that money against his overdraft.  There are many such cases of banks hoarding money.  If they believe a levy will be applied against them in a number of years time, they will want to increase their capital base and that will restrict lending.  How much of the moneys to be transferred by the Irish taxpayers to the banking system will be spent by banks in clearing the debts they have borrowed from other lending institutions abroad?  We need to know that figure because this is fundamental to what will be available to lend as credit to business around the country.If we all espoused the sentiment that we stand by our country, that we want to see a competitive and vibrant banking system, the restoration of our public finances to good health and for people to be able to get liquidity and credit so that business can flourish, there are other ways of doing it than through NAMA.  I reject the Bill that the Taoiseach has put before us because it is unfair and it does not allow for credit to flow.  It is a bailout for banks, speculators and developers and it exposes the throat of the Irish taxpayer to a banking system that has failed, as the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday, while being supervised, or not supervised as the case might be, by an incompetent Government.

He is wrong; there are four.  He always keeps forgetting about and omitting the fourth.  It is jobs, getting people back to work and addressing, through labour market measures, the needs of the people who have lost their jobs and who will lose jobs in the economy.The Labour Party agrees that we need to get the Lisbon treaty passed on 2 October and that is the reason we are campaigning in favour of it.  We will engage constructively on the debate that we will inevitably have about the public finances and what to do about them, although I suspect we may disagree about some of the measures that will have to be taken.  We will be advocating a fairer way.On the issue of what is needed to get the banks functioning again and lending to business, the Labour Party disagrees with the proposal that the Government has put forward on that issue.  NAMA is the wrong fix for a crisis that should never have happened.  It is a scheme to nationalise losses and privatise profits.  It exposes the State and the taxpayer to unnecessary and excessive costs and risks.  It will undermine the competitiveness of the Irish economy for years to come.I need hardly remind the House of the importance of this Bill.  The decision we are being asked to make on NAMA is enormous in respect of the quantum of resources.  It will be enduring in terms of the impact it will have on the economy and the public finances and it will be irreversible in respect of any future Government.  A decision, it appears, has been made by the Government to commit €54,000 million, that is 54 followed by nine zeros, deliberately overpaying for bad property loans.  If the Minister's figures are right, that overpayment amounts to €7 billion, but only if the figures are right.  No matter what the odds, it is a €54 billion bet.  Are the figures right?  There are aspects of these figures, presented by the Minister for Finance yesterday, that make me deeply uneasy.  In his speech yesterday the Minister said the following about his view of where property prices are, and where they are likely to go.  He said:The fall in property prices has pushed up property yields.  Yields are now above their long-term average, and this suggests that values are bottoming out.The Taoiseach repeated that today when he said that "NAMA will have to achieve less than a 10% uplift over current market values on its assets over ten years to break even."I was struck yesterday when I heard the Minister for Finance say that the assessment is that the market value of the loans is €47 billion.  I asked myself from where did we get this market value and from where do we get the assumption that values will lift by 10% to 15%, which will give NAMA the return.  We find in the green document that the Minister supplied us with that all of this is based on assumptions that are made about yields and about rents.  I will tell the House a few facts about rents and where the Minister for Finance is wrong.  There is a law on the Statute Book which provides that commercial rents cannot be reviewed downwards.  I know the Taoiseach will say that the Government has changed that, but it has only changed it for future leases.  Many retailers throughout this country who committed themselves to long leases in new shopping centres at the height of the property boom cannot get a downward revision on those rents because there is a law that provides that rents cannot be reviewed downward.  That is the reason commercial rents are high.Residential rents are still high because it is only in recent years that the Taoiseach's Government, at the behest of the Labour Party and also of Fine Gael, introduced legislation to regulate the private residential tenancies sector.  Many of the tenancies are not registered with the new Private Residential Tenancies Board.  At best the board has examined only a tiny minority of tenancies in terms of whether their rents are market value.  I keep meeting people who are still paying the rent for their apartment or their home that they were paying three years ago at the height of the boom when those rents were driven up by high property prices and even the rents that have dropped have not dropped in line with the drop in property prices.  The State is contributing to the high levels of rents we have.  In the residential sector the State is paying through rent allowances a high rental subsidy for in region of 60,000 tenants and in addition to that, the State is a tenant.The State, for example, is paying approximately €60 million for office property rental, much of which will not be used because the decentralisation proposals are not going ahead.  The Minister for Finance's entire house of cards, in terms of the market value of the properties — the €47 billion — and his assumptions about the 10% to 15% increase, is based on a rental sector, regime and yields that are not normal.  All of the tables he produced comparing rental yields in Dublin to Rome and Oslo is not comparing like with like.  It worries me that we have now got an approach to NAMA that is based on such a flimsy basis.Then we have risk sharing.  Last week was risk-sharing week.  We were told a big victory had been won by the Green Party.  What did we get in the Minister's statement?  We were told that risk sharing would be 5% — as small as it could possibly be.  The so-called risking sharing is no more than a puff of green smoke, a derisory concession to an ineffectual party whose only value now is the numbers that are required to keep Fianna Fáil in Government but who have sold both themselves and the public short.The decision to establish NAMA is being made in the cold light of day.  This is not like the night of the blanket guarantee, when the Government could at least claim that its profound errors were made in the face of fast-moving events.  This decision is being made after the Government has had every opportunity to seek advice, and to seriously consider all of its options.This is a moment when the Government could have achieved a unity of national purpose; when we could have come together to address the banking crisis in a manner that would gain support from across the political divide in a manner that would put the taxpayer first, but that opportunity too has been spurned.  Instead, what we got from the Minister for Finance yesterday was an exercise in partisan bluff.We have a decision that lines up perfectly with a long series of decisions during the property bubble and the housing crisis.  It is another decision to put the interests of property developers and banks first, at the expense of the taxpayer.  Every single decision — every U-turn, every twist in the tail — has put the banks first.  The status quo has been protected, the taxpayer has been left to pick up the tab.  After all that has happened, rather than moving to prevent another crisis of this kind, NAMA will preserve the very interests and structures that brought it about in the first place.

First, that there is a banking crisis, and that it needs to be addressed urgently.  A modern economy needs a functioning banking system, and the large retail banks are part of the nervous system of the Irish economy.  We need these banks in particular to be capable of normal lending — to families and businesses across the country.  It is a simple point, but one of which we cannot lose sight.  Business needs credit.Everybody knows that a severe credit crunch is affecting small business in particular.  According to the most recent statistics published by the Central Bank, the credit crunch got worse in the second quarter of this year.  Lending to the non-property, non-financial sectors declined over the quarter by €3.3 billion, or 6.2%, with the largest falls in absolute terms being recorded by the manufacturing and wholesale-retail trade.  The annual rate of change in credit to those sectors fell to minus 7.7%.  Credit extended to those sectors has declined on a quarterly basis for three successive quarters, with the pace of decline increasing significantly during the second quarter of this year.  These figures match the experience of the people to whom I speak around the country, despite the protestations of the banks and the Minister.To deal with this credit crisis, we need to clean up the balance sheets of the banks, so as to restore confidence in them, and to ensure that they can resume normal lending.  This process must focus in particular on the two large retail banks.  Those two banks are deeply embedded in the Irish economy.  They have been built up over decades and have a deep reach into the communities in which they function.  They cannot be quickly replaced.  They simply must be in a position to lend if the economy is to function.The second reality that must be faced is that there are constraints on Government action, particularly in the form of the blanket guarantee.  The Labour Party did not agree to that guarantee and we did not vote for it.  However, it is in place, and it acts as a severe limitation on the options available to Government.  From the minute the guarantee was put in place, the Irish taxpayer was always going to be lumbered with the bad loans in the banks, to a greater or lesser degree.  The question with which we are now faced is how to deal with them.  The balance sheets of the banks must be cleared up, so that lending can resume, or the economy will contract further.  We will see more and more firms, and more and more jobs, that would otherwise be viable, go under from a want of credit.Equally, as the world economy begins to recover, the absence of liquidity will restrict Ireland's capacity to share in that recovery.  This must be done at the least cost to the taxpayer, but the Government has issued a blanket guarantee, meaning that the taxpayer is exposed.  The question is how to limit the risk to taxpayers, while restoring the flow of credit to the economy.  Essentially, there are two options available.  The first is NAMA, the second is temporary nationalisation.  Let us be clear.  Neither of these is a good option — the crisis is too deep for that.  Either approach will be costly, but one is manifestly better for the State than the other.  Temporary nationalisation limits the risk to the taxpayer while NAMA increases that risk.  NAMA is based on a deliberate policy of overpaying for the bad loans.  Temporary nationalisation removes the risks involved in having to value the loans.Fianna Fáil has been trying to persuade people that it does not matter how one deals with the banking crisis.  In its version, the losses are the losses.  That is simply not true.  With the temporary nationalisation approach, there is no policy of deliberate overpayment, and the State stands to gain when the bank is sold again.  With the NAMA approach, the taxpayer assumes an unacceptable risk.  The Government knows all of this.  The issue has been debated in great detail in the media, old and new.  The overwhelming majority of independent economists, of all political viewpoints and none, is that temporary nationalisation is a better option.  Yet the Government is choosing to push ahead with NAMA.  It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Government is deliberately choosing to place the interests of banks above the interests of the taxpayer.What we also see, right through this legislation is a determination to preserve the status quo– to protect the toxic triangle of developers, bankers and bad government that got us into this mess in the first place.  We saw it in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, where the determination to avoid nationalisation led to the blanket guarantee and a subsequent nationalisation on the worst possible terms for the taxpayer.  We see it in the determination that at all costs further nationalisation should be avoided, which is what is driving the determination to over-pay for bad loans.  We see it in the refusal to shake up the boards of the banks and we see it in the extraordinary powers that the Government is assigning to itself in how NAMA will function.We should probably not be surprised that we are being asked to bail out the banks and the property developers in this way.  NAMA is simply another step in a long line of decisions that favoured property developers over many years.  A recent study of the housing sector by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice provides a picture of how housing policy has developed under this Government.  It notes, for example, that between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, the price of housing in Ireland broadly tracked the cost of building a house.  After the mid-1990s, however, there was a surge in the price of housing, which bore no relation to the cost of the relevant inputs.  By 2007, house prices had risen by four times as much as building costs.  The average price of a new house in Ireland increased by 344% between the mid-1990s to the peak of the bubble, rising from €73,000 to €323,000.  In Dublin there was a 408% increase over the same period.  Average second-hand house prices increased by 441%, and by 499% in Dublin.  Needless to say, wages were not increasing by the same amounts.  In fact, if new house prices had tracked the increase in earnings, that price of €323,000 in 2007 would only have been €124,000.When an economy starts to boom, one can expect house prices to rise, but one might also expect the Government to do something about it.  As long ago as 1999, the Labour Party was addressing housing policy in a comprehensive manner.  In February 1999, the Labour Party established a commission, under Professor P. J. Drudy of Trinity College, to advise the party on a wide range of housing issues, including the crisis in affordability that was facing young couples.  That report explicitly identified a number of factors that were leading to escalating house prices, including the lax lending policies of the banks, the impact of speculation on the housing market, and the effect of property based tax reliefs.The report made a series of recommendations covering a wide range of housing policies but with a particular focus on affordability.  Again and again during the past decade the Labour Party raised the question of spiralling house prices and it was ignored.  In 2003, the Labour Party made a submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution making clear that, in its view, there was no constitutional impediment to the implementation of the Kenny proposals to control the price of building land.  This was followed with a Bill to give effect to the Kenny formula which was again rejected by the Government.For its part, the Government twisted and turned in every way possible to avoid confronting this issue.  While it commissioned reports and promised action, that action either did not materialise or was, in some cases, reversed before it could have any impact.  More and more housing was treated as an instrument of speculation and accumulation rather than as a basic human need.  If one ever needed a more telling statistic in terms of how Fianna Fáil has deserted its roots in the past ten years, it is to be found in the figures on social housing.  In the 1930s and 1940s, social housing accounted for 60% to 70% of all housing output.  As late as 1985, the public sector was responsible for 27% of output.  However, in the boom years of 1995 to 2006 this fell to 6%.  Again and again we called for action but nothing was done.  At the same time, Fianna Fáil blatantly flaunted its connections to property developers and speculators.  Those lavish Fianna Fáil election campaigns, which took political spending in Ireland to new heights, had to be financed somehow.  Frankly, Fianna Fáil did not care how any of this looked.  Well, it looks pretty shabby now.Meanwhile, all of this was having a damaging effect on our economy.  As the construction bubble gained momentum more and more labour and resources were sucked in and became dependant on the construction sector.  By early 2007, more than 20% of all male employment was in construction.  As a result the competitiveness of the exporting economy was undermined.  After 2000, Irish export performance began to flag.  The export boom that Fianna Fáil inherited in 1997 petered out as the current account of the balance of payments turned negative.It is natural for any people who have gained new wealth to want to spend it.  It is entirely normal to expect consumption and housing output to grow in the wake of an export boom.  However, the purpose of economic policy is not growth for its own sake but to provide more employment and higher standards of living.  The people who were supposed to be in charge, the people whose duty it was to protect the economy were, at best, asleep at the wheel.  Fianna Fáil was in charge.  It was supposed to ask the right questions to ensure the banking system was properly regulated, to prevent the build up of risk in the banking system and it failed in that duty.If one wants an example of how the system was asleep one need only look to Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I know the main focus of attention today is on the large institutions but one has to ask how a small building society like Irish Nationwide Building Society acquired a commercial loan book of €8 billion.  How was that allowed to happen?  The pity of it is that action of any kind and at any stage would have at least lessened the impact of the banking crisis as it is being felt today.  In a bubble of this kind the worst excesses often happen just before the crash.  This commitment to the bubble economy has also been evident throughout the handling of the banking crisis.  Through every U-turn and policy switch there has been a common theme: protect the banks and the bankers and avoid nationalisation.We now know that on the night of the blanket guarantee, namely, 30 September 2008, the Department of Finance had prepared a Bill to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and that the Government instead put in place a guarantee for the whole banking system, including Anglo Irish Bank which represents €28 billion of the toxic debt we must now take over.  Anglo Irish Bank was kept alive for a further three months during which time significant bonuses were paid and it was January before the inevitable happened.The structure of the guarantee was in itself inexplicable as it covered parts of the banks' capital.  It has never been properly explained why dated subordinated debt was covered by the guarantee.  Bonds that are supposed to be available to absorb losses in certain circumstances were guaranteed by Government.  Why?  No adequate explanation has ever been given and no concerted action has been taken to reform the banks.  There have been some changes in senior management and at board level but change has been little and slow.  Last week, The Irish Times published a profile of the boards of the six covered institutions.  There have been significant changes at board level in Anglo Irish Bank and in Irish Nationwide Building Society but let us look at the boards of the other banks.  Leaving aside the two public interest directors, nine of the ten people on the board of AIB, ten of 12 people on the board of Bank of Ireland, eight of the 11 people on the board of EBS and six of the eight people on the board of Irish Life & Permanent have been in place since before 2008.  With all due respect to the individuals concerned, these boards have failed and the Government has done little or nothing to remove them.  Firm action in this respect would have cost little and would have contributed to restoring confidence in the Irish economy and in Irish sovereign debt.Even now, with all that we know, it is clear that lessons have not been learned.  The NAMA Bill before the House is intended to protect the toxic triangle not break it up.  Worse than that it will create an unhealthy alignment of interests for future Governments to contend with.  From now on, whether implicitly or explicitly, every Government policy will be NAMA-proofed.  Every measure proposed will be assessed on the criterion of what it will do to property prices and what impact it will have on NAMA.  The State will have an enormous vested interest in restarting the property boom and in getting property prices back up as high as possible.  In that sense, NAMA will have to be a self-fulfilling prophecy and everything possible will be done to ensure it succeeds.  Anyone who doubts that this is so need only look at the governance structures within NAMA as proposed in this Bill.The Bill vests in the Minister for Finance extraordinary powers and discretion in respect of decisions on how NAMA will operate.  Section 9 states: "except where otherwise provided by this Act, NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions".  However, there are many instances which are "otherwise provided for", thus it is not independent but must act at the direction of the Minister.  It is important these are identified.  Section 65, in respect of the Long Title, makes it clear that NAMA's function is to acquire "certain assets from certain persons to be designated by the Minister".  It is also to "perform such other functions related to the management or realisation of bank assets that it has acquired, as are directed by the Minister".  Under section 11, the Minster may confer on NAMA, by order, such additional functions as he or she thinks fit.  The designation of "eligible bank assets" to be purchased by NAMA is a power vested in the Minister for Finance by section 67.  Section 13 requires NAMA in the performance of its functions to "have regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister".  Section 14 sets out the Minister's powers of direction including, "the Minister may give a direction in writing to NAMA concerning the achievement of the purpose of this Act".There is one area where this ministerial discretion is particularly worrying, namely, the determination of acquisition values.  Again, it is important to list the specifics.  Under section 76, the Minister may make regulations to require NAMA to take into account the report of an expert concerning factors or matters relevant to the determination of the value of any property in question.  Under section 77(1), the Minister decides the "adjustment factors" to be taken into account in determining the "long-term economic value" of bank assets.  Under section 109, the Minister can appoint an expert reviewer and, under section 116, the valuation panel which in turn reviews the total portfolio acquisition value and then proceeds under section 121 to communicate its position not to NAMA but to the Minister.

The Governor of the Central Bank is also mentioned in dispatches.  It is clear from reading the Bill that NAMA will have very little real contact with the NTMA other than as a tenant.  The Bill also provides the Minister with extensive powers in dealing with the restructuring of banks after the loans have been transferred.  Under section 203, the Regulatory Authority may, but only with the approval of the Minister, give a direction to a participating institution in order to achieve the purposes of the Bill.  One has to ask where the Oireachtas would stand in such a situation and why these powers are being handed over to the Minister.  This continues a trend, established in the legislation underpinning the bank guarantee of extending extraordinary discretionary powers to a Minister and in this case to a Minister from a party which created the problems in the first instance.There are other legal problems with the Bill, as identified by the Labour Party in its recently published critique.  Some of these have been the subject of communication between my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Finance.  There are also important features in regard to the manner in which NAMA will operate that are not mentioned in the Bill.  For example, it is proposed that NAMA will assume ownership of the loans but that they will be managed by the banks that initiated them.  Has the Minister considered the potential for conflicts of interest in this arrangement?  How can a person who is an employee of a bank and whose career is based in that institution be expected to navigate any conflicts that might arise?  Will the banks that originated loans be allowed to buy back those loans at market prices in several years time?There continues to be many uncertainties about how NAMA will operate in practice.  The Second Stage speech delivered by the Minister was replete with such uncertainties.  The figures which gain most prominence in the media are inevitably the broad aggregates.  These figures are described in the Minister's booklet as "top down, illustrative estimates of aggregate loan purchase prices ... for illustrative purposes only".  Numbers that are absolutely vital to the entire enterprise are either heavily qualified or not included in the booklet.  The much spoken of equity in the loans can be imputed only from an "approximate average LTV".  Is it there or is it not?  We do not know and will not know until NAMA goes through the loans one by one.More important, we do not know the discount that ultimately will be applied.  The figure of 30% is an industry-wide estimate.  If it turns out to be inaccurate, the cost to the taxpayer will be high.  It is important to remember that the discount that will apply at the end of the process will be different across the different banks.  If it turns out that the figure of 30% is accurate overall but is much higher in Anglo Irish Bank than in the other banks, then the true picture is different from the one the Government is trying to paint.  It is fair for the Government to point out that it will not know the final figures until NAMA has done its work.  However, a year after the banking guarantee, it is striking that the estimates are still so shaky.  The cost of Government borrowing has been profoundly affected by the uncertainties surrounding the banks.  The slow pace at which this information has been released has contributed to that uncertainty.I wish to comment on the section in the Minister's speech in which he purported to cost the Labour Party proposal.  It was pretty pathetic stuff, unworthy of him and an inappropriate use of Civil Service resources.  To clarify, the Labour Party does not propose blanket nationalisation.  What we have suggested is a temporary nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  The Minister claims we have proposed a straight 50% write-down of bad loans.  We made no such proposal.  The Minister claims that, under nationalisation, we would have to borrow at market rates of 4% to recapitalise the banks.  There is no evidence to support this claim.  The Minister claims international markets would not lend to nationalised banks.  There is no evidence to support that claim and no serious commentator accepts it.  Many State-owned banks internationally have no difficulty in borrowing on world markets.The Minister claims our party's proposal is based on an ideological preference for public ownership of the banks.  As we have repeatedly pointed out, our proposal is to sell the banks back to the private sector as quickly as possible.  In other words, we propose to nationalise where necessary and resell when possible.  The reality is that Fianna Fáil is ideologically opposed to public ownership.

The argument for temporary nationalisation is well established and clear.  It avoids the risks involved in the valuation of loans and affords taxpayers the prospect of sharing in the benefits of a revived banking system.  The Minister knows this.  There have been many attempts to persuade us that NAMA is TOSIT — the only show in town.  The disciples of TOSIT, who must presumably be TOSERS, are everywhere and most seem to have a season ticket with Fianna Fáil.The reality is that there are other shows in town and viable alternatives to what the Government is proposing.  That proposal will cost the Irish public too much into the future.  It is built on very shaky assumptions in regard to market value and the way in which that value may increase in the future.  It is based on estimates that have not been fully explained and which are expressed only in the most general of terms.  The Labour Party is not convinced it is a gamble worth taking.  My party has advocated a better way, namely, the temporary nationalisation of the two largest banks and the cleaning up of their balance sheets so that they can resume lending to business and getting the economy moving again.  This strategy will be neither easy nor cost-free, but it involves less risk for taxpayers and will more effectively facilitate a functioning banking system.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The harsh reality is that our country is in a financial crisis.  As a small open economy, the international recession has hit us harder than most.  The mess in which we find ourselves has arisen in no small part from the greed and stupidity of a minority of those involved in banking, land speculation and building developments.  The property frenzy, largely driven by this minority, only halted when fear overtook greed and stupidity.  We are now left to deal with the consequences.It is no overstatement to say that our efforts today are aimed at saving the livelihoods and futures of Irish workers who had no part in that frenzy of greed and stupidity.  We seek to secure the future prosperity and independence of this State and the Irish people, who remain stricken by fear.  Any remedy we choose to resolve this crisis will be extremely expensive and unfair to workers.  I and my colleagues in the Green Party have worked in government to find the solutions which will get us out of this financial mess as quickly as possible.  We have devoted huge amounts of time in the past six months to finding the most effective options.To say the very least, the Green Party has never been a friend of bankers or builders.  We are unique among all the parties in this House in that we have never taken a red cent from either.  The Green Party would never co-operate with an effort to bail out bankers or builders.  Quite the opposite.  We see this initiative for what it is, namely, a stimulus for an economy that is mired in crisis, an effort to get money flowing back to business, and an initiative to save existing jobs and to create new jobs.  We need an effective and functioning banking system as part of a strategy to build economic recovery and to take advantage of the nascent and much anticipated international upswing.  We must ensure there is a flow of credit to fund businesses and to sustain jobs.  Our banks must be able to secure the funds to lend to business.  That is why we have worked in government on the creation of the National Asset Management Agency.Throughout these months of Government deliberations, we in the Green Party have stressed that the solution we choose must be the least expensive and the least unfair for the taxpayer.  I would not be standing here today if I were not convinced that we are on our way to finding that least expensive and least unfair option.  The National Asset Management Agency is the least worst option.  Moreover, we have worked hard to refine and adapt it to bring significant spin-off benefits to taxpayers and to ensure there can be no repeat of the property bubble which led us inexorably to this economic crisis.Our focus must be on resolving this crisis.  In that regard, it is logical to consider the viability of the alternatives to the NAMA proposal that have been put forward.  We have been offered a good bank option from Fine Gael, while the Labour Party offers nationalisation followed by another version of NAMA which it calls an asset recovery trust.  Despite both parties' efforts to delude the public, each of these would-be alternatives is both expensive and unfair.  More importantly, I am simply not convinced they would be as effective as the National Asset Management Agency in resolving our current dire difficulties.The Labour Party and some of its supporting commentators would have us believe that a 100% bank nationalisation is the way to go.  We looked closely at that prospect without any ideological baggage.  The simple reality is that full bank nationalisation would leave taxpayers responsible immediately for 100% of capital and funding costs for the banks.  It would instantly cost tens of billions of euro, which is money we do not have.  For example, in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, which had to be nationalised earlier this year, we found that we had to inject €4 billion in taxpayers' money to make good serious loan losses.  There is no other option when a bank is nationalised because banks must maintain minimum capitalisation levels.Ireland borrows most of its money abroad.  If banks were fully nationalised, the country's credit rating would be downgraded and borrowing would be significantly more expensive for the taxpayer.  Central to the Fine Gael Party's original plans for a good bank was an apparent threat to default on significant levels of bank debt.  This far-reaching step would have had disastrous effects, causing long-term damage to Ireland's reputation and, ultimately, costing much more taxpayers' money to fix.The bonds issued by banks are largely part of the banks' own funding and are owned by pension funds, insurance companies and other providers of long-term funds.  I will not waste time on this issue but it is sufficient to note that two former Fine Gael Party leaders, Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Mr. Alan Dukes, felt obliged to publicly express serious misgivings about the solution being advanced by the party to which they had given a large part of their lives and considerable talents.  All of us in this Chamber who have devoted time and effort to our parties will be aware of the personal dilemma involved for these two men.  I salute their integrity and honesty.Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to meet another former Fine Gael Deputy and stalwart of the party who wished me well and asked me to do my best for the country.

Until recently, we had to listen to lectures from incompetent and amoral bankers telling ordinary workers that they did not have a right to modest pay increases and that they, the bankers, knew best about everything.  It is more than tempting to borrow from the bankers' own rhetoric and allow the almighty market to take its course by letting the chips fall where they will.  The sad reality, however, is that to allow this to happen would hurt the ordinary citizen far too much.  Life savings would be lost, businesses would be crippled, our international reputation would be damaged irreparably and unemployment would spiral.  We must fix the banking system but in so doing we must also reform it.  We must install a new regulatory regime and rebuild trust.I have always stated that the Green Party's key objective is to protect the taxpayer.  This objective was central to our approach to finding a solution to the current crisis and in the ongoing work of elaborating the details of NAMA's working and the accompanying measures.  Under the NAMA proposal, the taxpayer is protected from risk in three ways: through ownership of stakes in the banks; through holding back a portion of the premium being paid over current market values; and through a levy which can be imposed on the banks if NAMA winds up with a deficit.The State, which owns 25% of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, will end up, through NAMA, owning larger stakes in the banks.  Thus, the taxpayer will share in any upside that may arise.  We have avoided the disadvantages of total nationalisation which I have already cited.We are paying 15% over market value for the loans to reflect the fact that there is no real "current market value" for property or property loans.  This premium reflects the levels to which valuations can reasonably be expected to recover over the medium term.  The premium amounts to €7 billion.  We are sharing the risk on this premium with the banks.  Of the €7 billion, the banks will only receive €4 billion up front and the balance of €3 billion at the end of the process, and only if NAMA makes a profit.  If, on the winding up of NAMA, there is a deficit, the Government may impose a levy on the covered banks to recoup these losses.  Even in such extreme circumstances, the taxpayers' interests are covered.The Green Party did not cause the economic problems we are now encountering.

When other parties were shouting for tax cuts and stamp duty amnesties, we warned of unfettered greed in the banking system, builder-led development and putting profit before people.  Our banking and property problems cannot be fixed unless we address our planning problems.In this country greed ruled over need when it came to planning.  The profits of developers and landowners were placed by councils the length and breadth of the country above the needs of ordinary citizens.  It is no coincidence that our commuter towns are now suffering most from the economic downturn.  These are towns where house upon house was built and field upon field re-zoned but hardly any facilities built, where unemployment rates have increased most quickly and house prices have collapsed by the largest amount and where citizens have paid an enormous price for the decisions of councillors who re-zoned at the behest of greedy developers and landowners.We have heard much from the Opposition which has used every opportunity to claim NAMA is a bailout.  That is not the case and if, for one minute, I thought it was a bailout for any developer, I would not touch it with a barge pole.  My party can stand proudly on its record on our dealings with developers and bankers and the policy decisions in which we have been involved.  Five years ago, almost to the day, the Labour Party and Fine Gael launched their much vaunted Mullingar accord.  Mullingar was chosen for the signing because of the power sharing agreement between the two parties reached on Westmeath County Council.  Did this agreement bring with it a new type of politics to County Westmeath?  Did people come before the profits of banks and land speculators?  Not one bit of it.  The power sharing agreement between the parties brought with it some of the most irresponsible planning this country has ever seen.

In individual towns, matters are even worse.  In many towns and cities councillors have zoned so much land that they will be long dead before it is used up.  Waterford has enough zoned land to last it until 2072 at boom time building rates.  In Dundalk the house building party could continue until 2073.  Deputy Lynch will be interested to learn that in Cork, building at boom rates could continue until 2053, while in Tralee the zoned land stockpile will last until 2043.

Councillors will have to abide by national and regional guidelines and will no longer be able to engage in zoning free-for-alls.The planning context for the post-NAMA period will be set by this legislation which aims to achieve much more focused land use strategies, with the provision of land zoned for residential and other development closely tied to national and regional policies and grounded in an evidence base of population projections and other needs.  A robust planning structure can ensure that some of the mistakes of the past are not repeated in that it should be no longer possible to provide vast tracts of zoned land without reference to population demand and the provision of essential services.  More focused land use strategies will also result in a more efficient use of taxpayers' money by allowing the State to target investment in essential infrastructure and services more accurately.  When our new planning legislation is enacted each local authority will have to review its development plans and, in many areas, deal with irresponsible rezonings of the past.The introduction of NAMA is also an opportunity to ensure that a so-called social dividend becomes an integral part of all future planning and development.  This has long been shamefully neglected.  The Green Party will ensure that our communities get the services they need and deserve.  It is essential that there is a social dividend to NAMA and that there is a first-refusal mechanism on NAMA assets for social projects, from schools to hospitals and community facilities.This morning, Mr. Tom Parlon and members of the Construction Industry Federation was on "Morning Ireland" complaining about this and claiming that NAMA would be "hog-tied" by such a provision.  I disagree profoundly and fundamentally with him and his members.   I have one message for Mr. Parlon and his people: "Please, keep your noses out of NAMA".  It is for the Government and Members of this House, of all parties, to decide on how NAMA and related planning reforms will work.Profit without social dividend is what created this property bubble.  Developers lived high on the hog from charging astronomical prices for sites for schools and other social infrastructure, from building serried ranks of houses without regard to the needs of those to whom they sold them.We will also ensure a windfall tax on the future rezoning of land.  In our deliberations over NAMA, we in the Green Party argued that a windfall tax on property developers would have to be an essential and indispensable component of the package.  It is the least the public deserve for footing the considerable NAMA bills.People have suffered too much from the culture of speculation which has infected our property and building sectors.  The remedy for this suffering from inflated prices and deficient facilities has been posited for more than four decades, but blithely ignored.  Now, at last, a key recommendation of the Kenny report can be put in place.I listened to what Deputy Gilmore said about 1999 and his own submission on the Kenny report.

Let us be clear, however, the risks and costs associated with NAMA arise if it does not make a profit.  Another risk is that it works and promotes another property bubble.  In formulating our policy, we have considered all of those costs and risks, and have sought at all times to minimise and eliminate any risk to the taxpayer.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The almost 250% increase in house prices between 1996 and 2006 was unsustainable and should never be repeated.  However, is it beyond the bounds of possibility that we could have a 10% increase in property in the next ten-year period, particularly when we get credit flowing again in the economy and given that inflation alone could be running at 2% annually?  That has to be a distinct possibility.  We have seen property prices drop to much more sustainable levels, and rightly so.  The measures we will introduce for good planning and re-zoning will ensure we never again return to those days of hyper-inflated property prices.There is a real circularity to the argument on NAMA: NAMA will work if we get credit flowing in the economy; if we get credit flowing in the economy, NAMA will work.  I have never owned a share in any bank or company in my life; I simply do not believe in it.  I believe, as a Green Party member for over a quarter of a century, that regardless of the solution being put forward — whether it be NAMA, the magic bank, nationalisation, default or whatever — the aim is to resurrect a system which is in and of itself unsustainable.  We in the Green Party know this, but we also know that we are hooked into this unsustainable system and that the transition out of it, which is absolutely necessary, will take some time.  In the meantime, the livelihoods of many people are dependent on the functioning of this flawed system.  That is why it is necessary in the short to medium term to make changes in order that the financial and economic systems are more ecologically sustainable.As a result of those changes that culture of greed and stupidity will be changed.  It will be a better regulated system, which will result in more benefits for ordinary people and a better quality of life for all.  That is why I will be pushing for further amendments to the NAMA legislation.  NAMA is undoubtedly the biggest decision this Dáil has ever taken, but it is also a turning point in Irish politics.  The circumstances that have given rise to this crisis will never be repeated.  I am aware of the great responsibility that rests on the shoulders of the Green Party.  After this crisis, the greatest opportunity we have had yet to transform our country will emerge.  The new planning legislation and the new programme for Government will be transformational in nature. They will be accepted by the Green Party membership only if that is so.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I want to begin by urging the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government to do its duty to the people and make a commitment, here and now, that if this legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas it will support a petition to the President under Article 27 of the Constitution to put the NAMA Bill before the people in a referendum.  The Constitution provides that the President may refuse to sign a Bill passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas if it "contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained".  If ever there was such a Bill then this is definitely it.Here is the real challenge to Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the Green Party.  If the Government will not put this Bill to the people and if Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the Greens are as exercised as they claim to be about the Bill, they should go to the country — either in a referendum on NAMA or by pulling the plug on this disgraceful, discredited and bankrupt Government, thus allowing the people to vote in a general election.The people are watching this debate and are watching how those they elect serve them, or if they serve them at all.  There is no doubt whatsoever about who Fianna Fáil and the Greens are serving with this rotten Bill.  It is a bailout for the greediest and the most corrupt in Irish society — the bankers and the speculators whose boundless avarice has devastated the economy.  Throughout the Celtic tiger years, Fianna Fáil-led Governments pampered this elite group.  They allowed them to benefit from massive tax breaks at unknown cost to this State.  They allowed them to determine the State's housing policy, which was to let the market drive everything and, boy, did that market drive.  It drove property prices to unreal and unsustainable levels.  It drove a frenzy of greed for profitable property, inducing many who could not afford to do so, to borrow to buy in the grossly inflated market.  It drove debt to levels previously unknown in this country.  It was fuelled by cheap loans supplied by a banking system corrupted by the culture of greed that saw massive salaries, bonuses and perks lavished at all senior levels in the financial institutions.Finally, the locomotive was driven into a wall and we are now left to deal with the train wreck that is the Irish economy today.  Who are the biggest losers in all of this?  Not the bankers and the property speculators who did the crime because they will never do the time.  Not the politicians who facilitated them because no-one in Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats Party and now the Green Party ever admits responsibility for anything and they are never made to pay the price for their disastrous policies and disastrous management.  The real losers in all this are more than 400,000 unemployed people in this State, the families saddled with massive mortgages, many of whom are being evicted from their homes, people who never had the chance of a decent home during the Celtic tiger years and the weaker sections of the community which are about to be punished most by the savage budget cuts in preparation.All this need not have happened.  Many of us, including Sinn Féin, urged a different direction.  Trade unionists, people in the community and voluntary sector, other parties of the left and economists with a social conscience urged policies based on the principle of equality and driven by need, not greed.  More than a decade ago, in our pre-budget submission in November 1998, Sinn Féin pointed out that the banks enjoyed a return on their equity that was double the European average, making them among the most profitable banks in the industrialised world.  We said that, ultimately, the banks should be nationalised in order that the Irish people would be the true beneficiaries.  We also proposed an increase in corporation tax for Irish retail banks with resulting tax funds earmarked for community and local development projects in the most disadvantaged areas throughout the State.Instead of this, we saw bank profits continuing to soar, a belated, limited and short-lived bank levy, successive banking scandals, which ripped off customers and the taxpayer, and collusion between banks and property speculators as they inflated the property bubble.  Now the same corporate criminals are to be bailed out by the Government using the people's money.  That is what NAMA is in a nutshell.  It is supposed to address the crisis caused by a corrupt system but NAMA may well turn out to be the source of the next decade's tribunals.  Higher taxes are coming, something the establishment parties have railed against for years, but they will not pay for better public services.  They will disappear into the NAMA black hole created by a Government refusing to take the obvious step of nationalisation to address the banking problem.The basic concept of NAMA is flawed and this legislation to introduce it is flawed through and through.  The focus point for most commentators has been the price NAMA will pay for toxic loans it transfers from the banks onto the taxpayers' balance sheet.  This is the argument around what discount NAMA should apply to the €77 billion worth of bad loans on the banks' balance sheets.  I hope we will get answers to the questions we pose in these contributions.  Will the Minister advise the House how much of that €77 billion was used in the purchase of sites and land banks and employed in development works?  In other words, how much of the €77 billion is accrued unpaid interest?The legislation states NAMA will not pay current market value for these loans — the amount that would be repaid to the banks if the properties the loans are on were sold immediately.  Instead it will come up with estimates based on "long-term economic value".  The moves by ACC Bank against the developer, Liam Carroll, have done the Irish taxpayer a huge service.  After being dragged to the courts, he had to admit that if forced to repay his loans he would only be able to repay one quarter of their worth.  That is based on the fire sale of his properties at their current market value.  Whatever price is paid for the bad loans, risk will transfer from shareholders and creditors to the taxpayer.  This transfer of risk creates a real danger of moral hazard in the future, that is, the banks engaging in risky lending behaviour because there are no consequences.NAMA is incapable of meeting the twin objectives of achieving the best value for the taxpayer and exposing the taxpayer to the least risk possible.  The debt to which NAMA will expose the taxpayer is €54 billion — one third of our GDP — and that is before the Government recapitalises, and make no mistake about it, these financial institutions will need to be recapitalised.  The detail of this was not placed before the House yesterday.  The taxpayer's exposure far exceeds the bank-related debt taken on by Sweden in its bad loan management in the 1990s, which equated to 8% of its GDP.  This will have implications for our sovereign credit rating, which has already been downgraded by several ratings agencies, and will incur increased debt servicing costs, potentially in the region of billions of euro annually.This legislation contains numerous problems.  These include a reliance on the banks acting in good faith to give all the information on the loans to NAMA.  The Minister for Finance will have sole power to appoint NAMA board members.  NAMA will be empowered to "work with developers" to finish projects, potentially lending them taxpayers' money to do so.  NAMA will also have compulsory purchase order powers to help developers complete projects if there are so-called "ransom strips" or contested land in the way. Power will be given to the Minister for Finance to overturn "independent" valuations of loans made by NAMA.Then there are the operational concerns.  Deputy Conor Lenihan is not interested in what I have to say but I hope the Taoiseach might listen to some of it.  NAMA will not have the expertise to reclaim debts, as it is not used to working in this sphere, and the staff the agency recruits may still be loyal to their former bank employers.  There is the prospect of developers' loans being nursed for decades while ordinary loan holders are forced to pay back their debts or face repossession.  NAMA will be another huge Government cost at a time other organisations of significant public importance are being amalgamated or abolished.  As for the notion that a levy will be introduced on the banks if NAMA makes a shortfall, we do not know how a "shortfall" will be defined, much less what the levy will be.The Government has put forward NAMA as an alternative to nationalisation but almost all commentators are agreed that even after NAMA, nationalisation might still be the outcome.  That is because even after the loans are taken off the books of the banks, there is nothing to guarantee against more loans becoming impaired as interest rates increase.  Further liquidity problems may arise and, therefore, the State will go down the route of equity capital shares that may be so large that banks will be nationalised by proxy.  The Government claims that cleaning out the banks via NAMA will bring about a return to normal bank practice and lending.  We are told NAMA is needed for the economy to return to normal and anybody anti-NAMA is either politically and economically naive, anti-patriotic, or both.However, this rests on the assumption that private bankers are committed to restoring our economy through providing credit and will place this above the interests of bank shareholders.  Will banks lend when they manage to get their hands on cash via the NAMA-issued transfer bonds?  A code of conduct for banks covered under the State guarantee scheme on lending to small and medium enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator last February and it took effect in March but SMEs in every constituency say the banks continue to deny loans and credit.  That is the reality.  This so-called leverage introduced in March has not had the effect it should six months after its introduction.  It is not certain what "normal" is when it comes to bank lending practices but it is certain that banks do not fulfil the role of public investment.  Historically, banks have lent too much and too easily in booms and have lent too little and too cautiously in recessions.My colleague, Sinn Féin finance spokesperson, Deputy Arthur Morgan, has rightly asked where is the NAMA for ordinary people.  When homes and small businesses are being repossessed the length and breadth of the State and people are facing negative equity and economic hardship, the Government can stand over bailing out banks and developers alone.  The guide to NAMA by the Department of Finance exposes the fundamentally flawed thinking behind it.  Frequently asked question No. 2 is: "How can you justify this further bail-out of the banks for assets and not prevent banks from increasing mortgage rates?"  The answer given states:It is true that the banks in most instances will not be paid the current market value but will be paid a price which is in accordance with the long-term economic value of each asset.  With regard to mortgage rates, the interest rates reflect commercial market realities as banks must pay more to access funds in wholesale retail markets.  The Government has no role to play in the commercial day-to-day operation of banks here and believes that it is important that the banking sector has a market presence and operates within market discipline and constraints.Surely if banks were operating in normal market conditions with discipline and constraints they would not be under a blanket state guarantee and in the middle of shifting all their bad loans off their books onto the taxpayers' heads at a bargain price for themselves.One of the most incredible aspects of NAMA is that it is outsourcing the property management aspect to private development firms.  Had it been used as a property management company, the State could have used land seized on defaulted loans for vital infrastructure, social housing provision or tourism development.  We now have the crazy situation where people throughout the country are sitting in homes and business premises in negative equity and worse, and are being evicted as their property is repossessed.  The property managed by NAMA should be available to local authorities to house people currently in need and those who will find themselves evicted as a result of banks moving against them, and they are moving against them with no care or thought for the human suffering involved.  However, the NAMA-owned property, paid for by taxpayers, is to be managed by private development companies.  Tenders have already been put out to attract such companies.  This revelation is highly suspicious and will lead many to believe that the taxpayer is again being deceived and robbed by the Government, banks and developers.Sinn Féin believes the only way to deal with the current crisis is to nationalise the two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, with the potential of turning these two banks into a State bank.  This will offer far greater security for the taxpayer.  Bad loans can be dealt with in the context of nationalisation and the State can make informed decisions about whether these loans should be foreclosed or managed.  We may need to set up a bad bank to deal with the toxic loans within the nationalised system.  The Government can then decide on a process of recapitalization and restructuring, and deliver the management control that will ensure resumed lending.  That is the critical need, namely, resumed lending to allow for a rejuvenation of the housing sector, affordable mortgage access for ordinary people, restructuring of existing mortgage arrangements and the opportunity for people in small and medium enterprises and retail outlets to have the chance to have working capital to get through these difficulties.  They are being choked off by people in banking institutions who have no other allegiance than to the profit line of their shareholders and management.The current upheaval in banking will undoubtedly have an impact on the staffing numbers at the banks.  This is a very important point that needs to be taken on board.  While a clear-out of those at the highest levels of the banks whose reckless mismanagement brought about the current banking crisis is required, Sinn Féin recognizes that the vast majority of bank employees played no role in the corruption and bad management that pervaded the sector.  The Government should work with the IBOA and other trade unions representing these workers to ensure the retention of the maximum possible number of jobs in banking and to ensure that employees who lose their jobs receive proper redundancy packages and the opportunity to retrain.The restructured banking sector envisaged by Sinn Féin goes far beyond just restoring so-called normality to the system.  There was nothing normal about a sector that systematically overcharged customers, was complicit in tax evasion and routinely withdrew access to financial services from working class and rural areas because of the profit pursuit.  I have raised these issues many times, not only on the floor of this House — I was first elected here in 1997 — but over the course of my five years as a member of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service where we encouraged and were part of the decision taken to go into a thorough examination of bad banking practice.  It would have kept the Government very busy.Nationalisation is preferable to repeated recapitalisation, which is excessively costly for the taxpayer, yet leaves the Government with no real say over how those banks are run.  It also deals with any potential losses that could be incurred by the taxpayer, having left the banks in private hands and bought the bad loans off their balance sheets.   If recapitalisation of a State bank or the nationalised banks is required this could be funded through national bonds which, unlike bank bonds, would be guaranteed.  The EBS, Irish Nationwide and Irish Life & Permanent must be examined to see if they can function with recapitalisation and the State taking a stake alone or if they need to have their business wound up and-or transferred to the other two banks.The issue of ordinary bank shareholders is a sensitive matter.  While many of these shareholders benefited during the boom period for the banks, many reinvested dividends in order to secure their future and have lost much of their pensions.  We have genuine sympathy for their conditions.  However, the interests of the taxpayer and public shareholders cannot be held hostage to the interests of private shareholders.  The most appropriate way to protect vulnerable shareholders and pensioners is to ensure  — I hope the Government will note this in its preparations for the budget in December — that no cuts take place to State pensions or other social protections and that the State pension for all those currently in receipt of same is increased.  In doing so one protects equally those who have lost life savings through risky investments and those who never had the money to make investments or build up a private pension in the first place.  It would be an exercise in equality.Sinn Féin opposed the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 which sought to grant the Minister for Finance the power to extend the guarantee beyond 2010.  While other states ran guarantees for longer while securing their banking systems, none had the extensive guarantee with the lack of appropriate conditions that we have.  A blanket guarantee is not the way forward for the banking system.We believe that the Committee of Public Accounts should be tasked with carrying out a full investigation of malpractice in the Irish banking system over the last decade. Its findings should inform better regulation of the banking sector.  Malpractice and even criminality by the banks led to this crisis — those are the accurate words to employ — yet there have been no arrests, fines, admissions or findings of guilt.  All those responsible must be investigated and prosecuted where the evidence warrants.  In one case since Christmas members of my community were brought before the courts and terms of imprisonment were handed down, not for defaulting but for being unable to service relatively small loans from financial institutions in our constituency.  That is mirrored in many other areas.  There are two very different laws at work, one for the poor and those who cannot afford to cope with the situation now presenting and those who were at the helm of what went wrong and whose actions and decisions influenced the current situation and were absolutely corrupt.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must disclose to the Dáil if investigations are currently being undertaken by the Garda or the Criminal Assets Bureau and the public must be kept informed of criminal proceedings being taken against those guilty of corporate malpractice.  Those at the highest level of the banks over the last number of years and suspected of culpability in mismanagement and fraud must be removed from their positions and new management installed in the nationalised banks.Other measures we would commend include whistleblowers' legislation to cover workers in the financial services and banking sectors.  The regulation of the banking sector should be intensified and made independent.  The role of credit unions should be enhanced through reforming legislation that allows them to expand their work as community-based not-for-profit services that support social and economic development.  I suggest that the Government should legislate for the right to a bank account, as has been done in the Netherlands, France and other states, to enable people without a bank account to open an account at a financial institution of their choice.  Several of my constituents have not been accommodated in this manner and therefore have no means of opening a bank account.  Deputies will appreciate what that entails for them.  It is absolutely outrageous.  I ask the Government to introduce legislation post haste that mirrors the approach taken in the Netherlands, France and elsewhere.  We also suggest that the Government should enable An Post to provide basic banking services, including a basic bank account.  I refer to simple, low-cost, no-frills current accounts that are designed for the many people in our communities who are financially excluded.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service should be given more support as it deals with the increase in personal debt and assists those who are trying to address personal financial crises.I accept that emergency action on banking is required.  There is no difference of opinion in that regard across this Chamber.  Emergency action should be taken to rescue the people's economy, rather than to rescue the bankers and developers who have devastated it.  The provision of fresh capital is just part of the solution.  It is more important to provide new leadership at the banks.  Such leadership should put the public interest first and work to strict criteria and guidelines.  We need a banking system that serves the people and in which the people can have confidence.  NAMA has nothing to do with improving Irish society.  The ultimate point of it is to socialise debt and privatise profit.  Therefore, this Bill should be rejected.  Even at this late stage, on the second day of the Second Stage debate on this facilitating legislation, Sinn Féin urges the Government to go back to the drawing board and reconsider its proposal.  It should recognise that Opposition voices, like large swathes of public, informed, professional and expert opinion, are cautioning it not to take the course on which it is set.  It is important for the Government to listen, to examine the alternatives and to accept, in light of that exposure, that there is a better way.  This Bill should be rejected.  On the basis of its failings to date, the Government should also be rejected.  If the Government is not prepared to support the petition to the President for a referendum on this Bill, if it is to pass, it should do the honourable thing and stand down.  The people should be allowed to decide who should be at the helm of the Government of this State.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	111	This straightforward Bill will prevent a trespasser from taking a civil action against a home owner who may injure that trespasser while defending his home.  It will mean that a home owner will not be subject to a criminal prosecution in such circumstances.  It seeks to set out clearly in law that a home owner is not under an obligation to retreat when faced with an aggressor in his or her dwelling.  One might be surprised to learn that one can be sued by a trespasser if one injures him or her while defending one's home.  I do not doubt that many people will be surprised to learn that a person who defends his or her home with the use of non-fatal force can face criminal charges at some later stage.  Fine Gael believes that the current arrangements need to be changed.  The present situation, in effect, tips the balance in favour of the trespasser rather than the home owner.  This uncertain position is unsustainable and is giving rise to confusion and a lack of clarity.Fianna Fáil is strangely resistant to proposals to clarify the situation and restore the rights of the householder.  Fine Gael's previous efforts to achieve legislative clarity were rejected.  A Progressive Democrats Bill also died a quiet death.  In April 2008, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, claimed the matter would be dealt with in the Government's legislative programme.  However, the current schedule of legislation states it is "not possible to indicate at this stage" when the Government might see fit to publish its criminal law (defence of life and property) Bill.  It is not clear if such legislation would be new, or would be a rehash of the old Progressive Democrats Bill.  Fine Gael is willing to step into the breach by introducing a Private Members' Bill that clarifies the law on home defence.  We have taken on board some of the objections to our previous Bill, which I will detail later in this debate.  We are willing to accept amendments, within reason, which may be forthcoming from any part of the House.I am surprised that Fianna Fáil Deputies are according such little priority to the issue of home defence.  There are three good reasons this Bill should attract cross-party support.  First, the Law Reform Commission has called for greater legal certainty in this area, a call that has been echoed by a Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Hardiman.  Second, Article 40.5 of the Constitution emphasises the inviolability of the dwelling.  Members of the Oireachtas should be guided by that constitutional principle when we frame new laws.  Third, from a political point of view rather than a legal one, I am surprised that my colleagues in this House do not want to be in a position to inform their constituents they have played a positive part in ensuring they will not be subject to tortious or criminal liability if they injure a trespasser while defending their homes.  It is important to stress the Bill does not have anything to do with using lethal force to defend one's home.  As it is concerned exclusively with non-fatal force, it seeks to amend the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.I ask Deputies to note that burglaries are on the increase, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can testify.  The Central Statistics Office has reported that in the 12-month period that ended in the second quarter of 2009, recorded aggravated burglary offences increased by almost 10%, to 340, when compared with the corresponding period up to 2008.  It is accepted that burglaries increase during economic downturns.  Accordingly, this Bill is appropriate and timely.I would like to comment on the common law position.  The matter of home defence was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the 2006 case of DPP v. Barnes.  While this case dealt with a fatal incident, it is relevant in so far as the court examined issues relating to home defence.  The case concerned a horse breeder living in an isolated rural area who interrupted two burglars as they were ransacking his home.  One of the burglars claimed that the householder attacked him with a knife, resulting in a struggle in which the householder was killed by multiple stab wounds.  The burglar claimed to be acting in self-defence.  In its deliberations, the court accepted the legal doctrine known as the “castle doctrine” into Irish common law.  This doctrine stipulates that while there is a duty on a person attacked in the street to retreat, this obligation does not exist if the person is in his own home.  The court stressed that the castle doctrine is by no means a licence to kill.  Instead, it means that a householder can stand his ground and does not need to retreat from an attack to defend his own home.  The court held that every burglary is an act of aggression and every burglar is an aggressor.  The Law Reform Commission has recommended the acceptance in Irish law of the castle doctrine.  In the Barnes case, the court also considered the doctrine of self-generated necessity, which concerns the onus on a person who has provoked an attack to retreat.  The court clarified that this defence does not apply to a person who causes conduct or a state of affairs with a view to using force to resist or terminate it.  Therefore, it is clear that the courts are attempting to introduce a fairer situation for the householder under common law.  In the Barnes case, however, the Court of Criminal Appeal stressed the need for legal certainty, which placed a clear onus on the Members of the Oireachtas to deliver such certainty.  Thus far, the Government has failed to provide the certainty needed.In 2006, my predecessor as Fine Gael justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, introduced a Private Members' Bill entitled the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2006.  I commend the Deputy on that initiative.  That Bill proposed to amend the law in relation to the protection of home occupiers who confront intruders.  Section 5 of the Bill specifically precluded a defence of murder or unlawful killing.  Section 3 proposed to create a rebuttable presumption that any force used by an occupier to protect his or her home or family is reasonable.  This would shift the balance in favour of the occupier.  Section 6(c) proposed to remove the requirement to retreat by amending section 20(4) of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  Section 7 then set out the factors that must be considered by a jury in order to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.  These include whether there were family members in the house at the time; whether it was a split second decision on the part of the defender; consideration of other options that may have been available to a defender; and the presence or absence of an honest belief in the availability of such alternatives.The Bill before the House today is similar to the 2006 Bill but we have taken on board some of the critiques made of that Bill and produced what I believe is enhanced legislation.  Once again, we introduce the notion of a rebuttable presumption that any force used by an occupier to protect his or her home or family is reasonable, which means that if a criminal case is taken against him or her the prosecution must prove that the actions were not reasonable in order to secure a conviction, thereby clearly shifting the burden off the householder and sending out a message that the law is on his or her side.  This Bill ensures that if the prosecution decides to try to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, the jury will consider the defendant's specific circumstances at the time of the confrontation.  These circumstances, which are set out in section 7 of the Bill, included the following: the presence or absence of family members in the house at the time; the fact that the householder might only have had a split second to decide what to do; the fact that he or she may have had few options for defending home or family; and that he or she may have honestly believed that few such options were available.  Anybody who has experienced a burglary will know of the horrendous ordeal it visits upon homeowners and their families.This Bill places on a legislative footing the notion that the occupier does not have a duty to retreat from confronting intruders.  Under section 20 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, when deciding if a person's actions were reasonable a jury may consider whether he or she tried to avoid a confrontation by retreating.  This provision was designed originally with street disturbances in mind and is meant to encourage potential brawlers to walk away from potential confrontations.  It has no place in a situation where a person disturbs a burglar in his own living room while his wife and children are asleep upstairs.  This provision places the castle doctrine which was approved in the Barnes case and by the Law Reform Commission on a statutory footing.The Bill specifically precludes providing a defence to murder or unlawful killing in section 5, again echoing the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Barnes case.  I stress to Members, and those in the Labour Party in particular, this provision cannot therefore be described as a murderer's charter or anything of the sort.  The protections in this Bill would have had no effect in a case where a householder killed an intruder in cold blood and the Bill does not seek in any way to justify actions that are over the top or premeditated.  For that reason, consideration of previous break-ins or intimidation is not outlined as something the jury must consider, although it could go towards the person's perceived lack of options.The Bill also provides protection from civil liability to people who could potentially be sued by a trespasser.  A householder now has no liability for an intruder to trips or injures him or herself in the person's house, even if the injury is caused by the defensive actions of the householder, so long as the force used was reasonable.  I believe this is a very important provision which will be welcomed by ordinary and decent people throughout this State.  This provision emphatically tips the balance of rights in favour of the homeowner and away from aggressors who would seek to violate the dwelling and commit the act of burglary.The Bill contains a number of important provisions.  The actions must take place within the home and a person who follows an intruder into the garden and assaults him there will not have protection under this Bill.  The rebuttable presumption can, as its name suggests, be rebutted, so actions are not necessarily reasonable.  If they can be shown to have been excessive, no protection exists under this Bill.  The difference is that the prosecution will have to prove that excessive force was used.  A person who knowingly assaults a garda is not protected by this Bill.Fine Gael does not advocate occupiers taking on intruders themselves, and indeed would rather advise avoidance of confrontational situations with criminals who may be armed with knives or guns and who are not afraid to use them on innocent, law abiding citizens.  This Bill affords legal justification for personal protection by people who find themselves in unavoidable situations after being confronted by intruders in their own homes.  Far from encouraging people to take action, we want to assure them that if they do take action, the law will be on their side and not the criminal's.This Bill is different in several ways from the 2006 Bill.  The definition of "trespasser" has been changed from the definition of the term in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995 to one which takes into account the objections of the then Minister for Justice that the 2006 Bill did not account for party goers who refused to leave.  We took this point on board and the present Bill covers cases where a person enters a house lawfully, either for trade or other purposes, but whose presence becomes unlawful, as well as a person who simply enters the property unlawfully.The 2009 Bill also addresses a potential contradiction that existed in the 2006 Bill in respect of the conflict between providing a rebuttable presumption that the force used was reasonable and the exemption for liability in civil law for any act done by the home owner or occupier in effecting this reasonable force.The most significant difference is that the Bill provides that where a criminal offence occurs in a victim's home, the judge must take this into account at sentencing as a serious aggravating factor.  This is a significant and meaningful change and one which supports Fine Gael's broader position of defending victim's rights and protecting people in their homes.I am pleased to introduce this Bill to the House.  Following the lead given by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in 2006, Fine Gael has stepped up to the plate to deliver the legal certainty that has been sought by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Law Reform Commission in respect of home defence.  Most importantly, we are taking steps to protect home occupiers from civil and criminal liability should they injure trespassers who have violated their homes.I appeal to my colleagues on the Government benches to read this Bill because I have already heard misrepresentations from Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  They should consider its contents and ask themselves whether they can justify voting against it.  If they have difficulties with the legislation, we can find solutions on Committee Stage.  Would opposing this Bill be minor political point scoring at the expense of delivering a genuine improvement in our legal framework?  This is an opportunity for us all to stand up for homeowners' rights.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I strongly support the Bill and congratulate Deputies Charles Flanagan and Ring on bringing it before the House.  Legislation is often introduced in an emotional manner as a hurried response to a recent atrocity.  I am pleased this Bill is presented today in a different manner, where emotions are relatively low concerning the subject.  It is a Bill which is presented partly in response to historical events but, more importantly, which offers an element of protection to the citizen in response to a violation of his or her home.The Bill contains recognition of the flaws, inadequacies and potential shortcomings of a similar Bill proposed some time ago.  This again reflects potentially sound legislation for the Statute Book.  If the then Government had allowed the earlier Bill advance we would not have achingly slow progress on the issue.This issue has been flagged by Mr. Justice Hardiman of the Supreme Court.  The Bill reflects, and attempts to recognise through the law, Article 40.5 of the Constitution, which states:The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.This Fine Gael Bill promotes the protection of homeowners from criminals.  It protects the victims of intrusion from the intruder.  It seeks to rebalance the law in favour of the victim as opposed to the outrageous current situation where law-breakers are protected.Over the past number of weeks there has been a marked increase in burglaries throughout my constituency in County Clare.  If you take a line from Coose, County Galway through to County Clare and, in particular, Whitegate, Scarriff, Broadford and Quin, roughly the R352 regional road, I can recount four individual incidents.  Many homeowners in the east Clare — south-east Galway artery find themselves having to put in place more elaborate security systems.  Sheds and storage areas that form part of their curtilage resemble an Irish version of Fort Knox.  This is not just a benign natural occurrence.  I am convinced that one can link what is happening to the economy with the increase in crime towards property and belongings of the person.  No doubt this phenomenon will increase steadily if we, in the Oireachtas, do not do something.  This legislation is a small, but effective step to attempt to solve the problem.  The law must be seen as an instrument that protects and supports its citizens.The Government, just like the previous one, will no doubt trot out statistics such as the massive increase in Garda resources both in personnel and finance in the fight against crime.  I am sure we will hear this again today.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is happy to declare that there are 14,000 gardaí in the country, as if this in itself is an adequate response to the question of protection of citizens from crime.  There is something not quite right when almost the only interaction of people with the Garda is on meeting the traffic corps.  There has been a conscious decision to develop elements such as the traffic corps, leaving rural stations and community policing to wither and die.The east Clare area to which I referred in the context of burglary and crime against the person and belongings is a massive geographical area which has been further increased with the redrawing of the operational areas.  This is an area served by the part-time Garda station in Scarriff with just one patrol car and a maximum of five gardaí.  These gardaí are committed to the concept of community-style policing and do excellent work, both from the point of view of crime prevention and solving.  However, just as importantly, they present a proper image of a police force that is part of the fabric of its own community.  Today this is an all too rare occurrence.I hope the Minister will accept this Fine Gael Bill and proceed with its implementation.  However, I have my doubts.  I can recall Deputy Shatter's effort last year in relation to victims and the manner in which it was dealt with.This Fine Gael Bill removes the need for homeowners to retreat from confronting intruders.  It is a fair Bill that protects the victims of crime.  The Minister cannot overlook this unjust situation any longer.  I urge him to take on board this Fine Gael Bill and I urge his colleagues to do so as well.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	113	It is important that we have a reasoned debate and that the issues are argued and debated reasonably.  The same might be helpful from the point of view of newspaper comment.  I recall when we debated this matter on my Bill three years ago some comment in the newspapers that just did not relate to the facts of the Bill and rather seemed to be prejudicial ranting.The starting point for me on this Bill is the Constitution.  Article 40 is quite clear, stating:The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.The problem is that the dwellings of the citizens are being entered every day.  In fact, as I understand it, there are approximately 500 burglaries every week.The question is what type of legal certainty should exist as to the rights of a homeowner in confronting these burglaries.  Some of these are aggravated burglaries and some of them have serious consequences.  Over the years there have been instances of homeowners who have been killed in their own houses.  At the very least, we owe it to homeowners to have certainty in the law as to what they are entitled to do to defend themselves, their families and their property.  My appeal to the Minister is that he would look at this Bill in that context.There may be flaws in the Bill.  I made the same case when I introduced my Bill along the same lines three years ago.  I indicated that if the Minister had problems with any aspects of it, to refer it to Committee and to tease out those problems.I am glad that my colleagues, Deputies Charlie Flanagan and Ring, have produced a new updated version of my Bill which deals with some of the questions raised about it three years ago.  From that point of view, it is a Bill that should be given the most serious consideration by this House.Essentially, the Fine Gael approach is to get certainty in the law as far as the rights of the homeowners are concerned and to shift the balance in favour of the homeowner.  It is not a question of saying to burglars that they have no rights, but certainly before the law they must have far fewer rights than the homeowner.  The homeowner must be entitled to defend himself, his family and property.As Deputy Flanagan mentions, the homeowner may be wise on occasion not to do that and to run, but fight or flight is a matter on which a homeowner must make up his or her mind in a split second.  The natural human reaction is fight or flight, and there may be only seconds in which to decide which to do.There should be no compulsion on the homeowner to retreat.  There should be an understanding of the situation that the homeowner is confronted with and certainty as to his or her rights in the event of whatever decision he or she takes.  It seems ludicrous that if in such a situation the householder injures the burglar or trespasser, the trespasser could possibly sue the homeowner.  That is outrageous.I do not intend to go into the detail of the Bill.  I want a reasoned debate.  I want a response from the Minister that he accepts there is a reasoned case to put forward.  If there are technical issues in this Bill to address, as there could have been in my Bill three years ago, let us tease them out in Committee.  I suggest that the proper response from the Minister is to let this Bill through, let it go to Committee Stage and tease out any outstanding flaws at that stage.  That would be a reasoned response and what homeowners would expect.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I commend this Bill and congratulate Deputy Charlie Flanagan and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe who worked on this Bill for quite a number of years.  I acknowledge Deputy O'Keeffe's call for a calm debate.  We need a calm debate on this matter because it can raise emotions.  Certainly, it is a technical legal matter and when one enters that realm one must try to have reasoned debate.  Why are we at this impasse in terms of home security as regards people feeling vulnerable in their homes?  That question needs to be asked.  The Minister as a Border Deputy can relate to the fact that existing Garda resources do not adequately protect the citizen.  I have been calling for extra Garda resources in Border areas for a number of years. Legislation such as this is required because of the degree of vulnerability.  People do not feel safe in their homes as was highlighted last spring with the spate of burglaries in north Inishowen that could not be contained because of insufficient Garda resources.  I commend the fact the assistant Garda Commissioner acted proactively in deploying extra resources to north Inishowen.  This was critical because of the danger that vigilantism would take over, as opposed to effective community policing.  This is the crux in which we find ourselves.  As the Minister will be aware, the spate of robberies climaxed in the horrific robbery at gunpoint of the postmistress in Carrigans in east Donegal, half a mile from the Border.  As of yet the perpetrators are unpunished.There is nothing in our law to protect the victims of such crimes, as Deputy Charles Flanagan has pointed out, and that is where the anomaly arises.  The need for this legislation is particularly pressing in Border areas which are not serviced by sufficient Garda numbers.  A comparison can be made with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's Cork area,  although this is not a perfect example, in places such as Glanmire, Carricktwohill, Cobh and Bandon.  There is a 24-hour Garda station in Glanmire with 22 gardaí based there and 50 based in Cobh.  Taking a similar population distribution in Derry city, there is no legislation that takes into account population numbers to the east of it on the other side of the Border.  I am referring to places in east Donegal such as Burnfoot with 16 gardaí, Muff with two, Carrigans with five, Newtowncunningham with four and Carndonagh with five.  These stations are only open three hours per day.  Therefore, there are anomalies in terms of the whole vulnerability question.  If we are not going to provide proper and adequate Garda resources we will not ensure that people are comfortable and safe in their homes.The Bill has been described as right wing, but it is not.  It is not designed for the person who can afford house alarms and guard dogs and who lives in a secure urban area.  It is very much designed to protect the person living in isolation in a rural area, and that is its raison d’être.  Statistics from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform show that some 29% of crime in Donegal is undetected.  That highlights the anomaly in terms of Garda resources.  I therefore ask the Minister to consult with the assistant Garda Commissioner as regards the effectiveness of deploying extra Garda resources to Inishowen at a time of increased burglaries.  I would look at that pilot model and see how effective it has been and how it combated the vigilantism which was on the increase at the time.Article 48 of the proposed Lisbon treaty provides for more effective communication between the PSNI and the Garda, so hopefully there will be a positive outcome in relation to that in the referendum.  Also, we must examine the Schengen Agreement as regards cross-Border co-operation.  I shall leave it to Deputy Crawford to deal with the bureaucratic process involved as regards applications for gun ownership.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I congratulate Deputy Charles Flanagan for bringing forward this Bill.  I listened to him as he dealt with the legal and technical reasons why the legislation is needed.  I also congratulate his predecessor as party spokesman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who tabled a similar Bill in 2006.  Fine Gael does not advocate or encourage force, but defends a person's right to defend himself or herself and the family in the home.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2009, as it is important that we protect the victim rather than the criminal, especially within people's own homes.  This Bill, if passed, would mean that if someone breaks into a house and one must use force against him or her, such force is presumed to be reasonable.  It means, in the event, that the person using force could not be prosecuted as a criminal.  It would also mean the intruder or criminal could not sue for damage done to him or her.The Bill also covers one if somebody breaks into one's house against whom one uses force and he or she dies.  If the force used is reasonable, there will be no prosecution for murder.  However, if force is intentionally used that is likely to kill, the Bill will not protect the user of that force.The reason this Bill is being brought forward is that concerns as regards the protection of people in their homes remain, as highlighted by the contradiction that a person can be liable in a civil action for any force he or she uses against a trespasser in such an incidence.  This issue has not been dealt with the in the programme for Government or by any other party in the current Dáil, even though we were promised it would be addressed when we produced a similar Bill in 2006.The protection of people in their homes and in their own areas, especially in the Border region, from Donegal right through Cavan-Monaghan and Louth, was never more important.  Deputy Joe McHugh dealt with that to some degree a few minutes ago.  People are living in fear because of the actions of a small minority who refuse to accept the peace process and for that reason I am pleading that not only should Garda numbers be maintained in the Border region, but if necessary, improved.As with Deputy McHugh, I want to suggest it is unacceptable that no Garda station is open at night in an area from Ballyconnell to Monaghan town.Last year there was a case of what seemed to be an isolated incidence of a bomb discovered in the Rosslea area along the Monaghan-Fermanagh section of the Border.  Only this week we had another threat in that same area, which as I speak has not been confirmed, although people in the area and those travelling through it on the main Monaghan-Enniskillen road are being inconvenienced and threatened.  This scare follows immediately after a real bomb in Donegal town, which it took a bomb disposal group four hours to reach.  There was also a 600 pound bomb at the edge of Forkhill, as well as threats to the parents and sisters of a PSNI officer in Derry city.  It is sad to think that while Catholics are being encouraged to join the Northern Ireland police force, the PSNI, they are put under threat when they do.I raise these issues because it is important that people living down the country realise the threats and fears that so many people have to cope with in the Border region.  Only last May when I canvassed the Clones region, in what is known as a "no go" area, I found people living in desperate fear.As Deputy McHugh indicated, I want to mention the issue of gun licences.  Many small farmers and others have held gun licences down through the years, for their own protection as well as to shoot vermin.  Such a person now has to fill in a nine-page form, which is a move away from the ordinary to the ridiculous.  We blame the EU for all the form filling at the agricultural level, yet here we have a situation where our people are being asked to fill in such a form.  The Minister might argue that it is simple and all the rest, but for an ordinary uneducated person it is absolutely over the top and we need to ensure that those people do not panic and allow their guns to be taken away from them, because they were useful and offered them some form of protection.  I believe the Minister has some role in that regard.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I commend Deputies Charles Flanagan, Jim O'Keeffe and other colleagues who, over a long period, have attempted to rebalance the law in respect of what happens in people's homes.  The importance of feeling secure in one's own home should be taken for granted in our modern society, but unfortunately this is not the case.  While it is not covered in this Bill, we hear much about violence on our streets and public areas.  At least in that regard people have the choice to stay away from such streets at certain times of the night.  With regard to violence and attacks on the home, break-ins and burglaries are visited upon people and they do not have that choice.In addition, these issues often threaten the most vulnerable people in our society, the elderly and people who cannot afford to make their homes secure.  Let us step back and consider how these people think in the context of what is happening in our modern society.  For example, last year's budget withdrew the grants for elderly people living in rural areas to install alarm and lighting systems.  The opening hours of some of our Garda stations have been reduced and restricted.  The McCarthy report has proposed that half the Garda stations should be closed down.  What message does that send out?  The court in Ballinrobe in my constituency has been moved to Castlebar.  There was an old adage in society that suggested that justice should be seen to be done in their own town.  In recent weeks there have been stabbings in Ballinrobe itself.  This is the context in which people are thinking.  They also see the millions of euro being spent on free legal aid to defend these thugs when they are apprehended.  What message does that send out to the people in these areas?  A number of weeks ago during an attack on a house in Charlestown in my constituency in which €60 was stolen, a man had his leg broken, resulting in him being hospitalised.  What message are we sending out if we do not implement the Bill before us today?As my colleagues have said, the Bill does not suggest that people in their own homes should be entitled to go on the attack or act in a way that is over the top and murder an intruder in cold blood.  If actions are proven to be excessive, there is no protection under the Bill.  It does not advocate or encourage confrontation or violence against intruders who may be armed with guns or knives.  The key provision of the Bill is to give legal protection to householders who find themselves in unavoidable situations when confronted by intruders.  There is an urgent need to tip the balance in favour of people whose houses are broken into.The feeling on the ground is that law-abiding citizens are not safe in their own homes.  Not only are they not allowed to defend themselves, but they also see the thugs who attack them either released on bail or released early if they are caught and prosecuted.  I recently met a couple who had been attacked in their own home last year by a gang using iron bars and other implements causing €5,000 worth of damage.  Members of the gang eventually got two years imprisonment.  The culprits were granted free legal aid and released after spending only a few months in prison.  The victims of the attack only became aware that the culprits had been released when they waved to them driving past their house in the village.  One can imagine the fear and anger that release caused to that household.  One can imagine how the innocent victims in this case will feel when I inform them of the details of a response to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister this week revealing that free legal aid in criminal cases in Mayo cost the taxpayer €103,000 for the eight months from January to August 2008.  Ironically the grant that would have allowed this couple get a house alarm was abolished last spring.There is an urgent need to rebalance the law in favour of the victims of crime in their own homes.  The pendulum must swing back towards the law abiding citizens.  This Bill is a genuine attempt to do this and I strongly recommend it to the House.

Members on all sides of the House will accept that this is an issue in which we all have a substantial interest and with which the Government has some sympathy.  Deputies and the public at large are aware of cases in which persons have entered a house or a property without adequate excuse and with criminal intent with the result that injuries or death have been caused.  Such cases have fuelled the debate over whether the law as it stands strikes the right balance between the rights of the occupier and those of the trespasser.  I am aware that there is a genuinely held view that while the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 legislates adequately for case of self-defence in most situations, it will not give protection to a person who finds intruders entering his or her home with criminal intent.  I am fully aware of the efficacy of the current legislation but I also share the understandable public concern that in protecting the home dwelling we should have the very best legislative resources available to us.I am a strong believer in tough legislative provisions in combating criminal activity of all kinds.  Recent legislative measures which I brought to a conclusion in the last Oireachtas session in respect of a range of criminal law matters are testimony to this and I make no apologies for taking such a stance.  However, I do not believe the proposal before the House is adequate, well thought out or robust enough to justify it receiving Government support.  I will outline my reasons for that.  The strong advice from my officials and the Office of the Attorney General is that does not provide a good base for legislating in this respect.The Bill is in effect a repeat of the Bill, albeit with minor modifications, that was considered and rejected by the House in June 2006.  The Bill contains numerous flaws which in my opinion render it inoperable for the purpose for which it was intended.  I will outline some of those flaws in the course of this debate.  In response to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's point that we should allow it to progress to Committee Stage, the strong view was that it contained so many flaws that it does not form the basis for doing so.  In addition, we have received confirmation from the Law Reform Commission that it will publish its report and a draft Bill before Christmas.  I do not believe it would be appropriate to take up time discussing a Bill now when the Law Reform Commission will produce a Bill.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We have already accepted that we would postpone consideration of our own Bill in which we published a scheme a number of years ago on the basis that the Law Reform Commission report is now due.The special status of the home dwelling has always been linked with the dignity of the individual.  It is my contention that an attack in the home has unique characteristics, very different from other forms of attack, given the potential emotive nature of such an encounter.  I suspect that a great many people share this opinion.  Deputies will be aware that Article 40.5 of the Constitution contains a specific provision that "the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law".  This is a constitutional provision of paramount importance to every Irish person.  As well as the protection for the home provided for in the Constitution, the special protection afforded to the dwelling house dates back many centuries.  It has been expressed in various ways, including a legal case dating back as far as 1604, which stated: "That the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his repose."  This is the origin of the "castle doctrine" which is especially prominent in the law of the United States.We all recognise the importance of the home as a haven of safety for those who live in it and as a place where the individual's privacy should be sacrosanct.  For this reason an uninvited intrusion in the home by someone, with criminal intent, cannot and should not be tolerated.  The law recognises that the application of reasonable force, in such circumstances, may be required to repel such an intruder.  If the home is inviolable under the Constitution it is arguable that a person should not be required to give up ground and allow his or her home to be violated by an intruder.Furthermore, our Constitution, in Article 40.3.2°, imposes a duty on the State to protect by its laws "as best it may its citizens from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen".  The legislation which applies in this jurisdiction with regard to self-defence is the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, which was drafted following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  Self-defence is only one element of the Act.  It is a general principle of law that one can act in self-defence against attack or even imminent attack.  Sections 18 and 20 of that Act are most relevant to the issues under discussion here today.  It is made clear that reasonable force may be applied to protect one's self or a family member or another from injury, assault or detention caused by a criminal act and to protect one's property from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by the criminal act or from trespass or infringement.Significantly, section 18 of the Act stipulates that the use of force applied by a person for the purposes set out in the Act is "such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be." In other words, it is a subjective text which allows that the person using force may use the level of reasonable force he or she feels is necessary at the time of the attack.  However, the question of whether the use of force in circumstances in which a person is defending himself or herself from attack is justified is fundamentally a question of whether such force is applied reasonably.  Clearly, each set of circumstances is likely to be different, and the 1997 Act leaves it for a court and jury to decide whether the use of force was reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case under consideration.The 1997 Act also provides that juries are given the option of rejecting a plea of legitimate defence where they are satisfied it was unreasonable not to retreat.  Section 20(4) of the 1997 Act states that "the fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account, in conjunction with other relevant evidence, in determining whether the use of force was reasonable".  The Act therefore retains the principle of conflict avoidance in circumstances where that is possible.  It has been argued this particular provision seems to put a question mark over a person's right to defend his or her home or property.  I recognise it is not always possible or even desirable to retreat in circumstances where an intruder enters the home, but it should also be borne in mind that a jury, in assessing the reasonableness of a person's actions in such circumstances, would also be likely to appreciate the realities of the dilemma which would face an occupier in that situation.Most people would agree that an attack or threatened attack from an intruder entering the home is very different from an attack or threat of attack in some other location.  In the context of an intrusion into the home, there may be family members present who need protection, or valuable property that a person does not wish to abandon.  It may be that the level of fear generated by an unwanted intrusion renders the occupier incapable of retreat.  I acknowledge therefore that the situation with regard to the application of self defence in the home may be significantly different from the application of legitimate defence generally.  While the 1997 Act is undoubtedly an effective piece of legislation, it deals with the issue of legitimate defence generally and in any location, and not specifically in the context of an attack which takes place in the home.However, the House is aware that we live in a common law jurisdiction.  We are not bound only by statute.  The most recent relevant case law in this area is unequivocal with regard to legitimate defence in the context of unwanted entry to the home.  In December 2006 the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a significant judgment in the case of DPP v. Barnes, on a burglary during which a fatality had occurred.  This lengthy and detailed judgment is worthy of careful consideration by Deputies and by the public in general.  In it, the Court of Criminal Appeal drew, inter alia, the following legal conclusions:Every burglary in a dwellinghouse is an act of aggression.  The circumstances may make this element of aggression more or less patent but the violation of a citizen's dwellinghouse is just that, a violation and an act of aggression no matter what the other circumstances.The judgment goes on to say: "Although [the burglar] is not liable to be killed by the householder simply for being a burglar, he is an aggressor and may expect to be lawfully met with retaliatory force to drive him off or to immobilise or detain him and end the threat which he offers to the personal rights of the householder. . .".With regard to the issue of retreat in the face of an intruder, the Court of Criminal Appeal was no less emphatic.  The judgment stated:It is . . . quite inconsistent with the constitutional doctrine of the inviolability of a dwellinghouse that a householder or other lawful occupant could be ever be under a legal obligation to flee the dwellinghouse or, as it might be put in more contemporary language, to retreat from it.  It follows from this ... that such a person can never be in a worse position in point of law because he has decided to stand his ground in his house.That is the common law position in this jurisdiction as of 2006.  It has been clarified and has gone a long way towards addressing the concerns that have been voiced on this subject.  After reading the entire judgment, I find myself fully in agreement with it.  It is important to note that the Court of Criminal Appeal makes a distinction in respect of homicide.  The court expressed the view that a person cannot lawfully lose his life simply because he trespasses in the dwelling house of another with intent to steal.  Where homicide occurs, whether of the burglar or the occupier of the dwelling, the common law must still be applied.I reiterate that the Government is opposed to this Bill, although sympathetic to the idea behind it.  We are opposed to it not for any narrow political reasons but simply because it contains some serious defects.

Section 3 of this Bill, for example, provides for a presumption that any force used by an occupier on a trespasser within the dwelling is reasonable in all circumstances.  This presumably applies even if the trespasser is on the premises innocently — for example, a child who may wander into the dwelling from a neighbouring house.  The section does not expand on the circumstances in which force could be used.  For example, it does not state that force must only be used in the protection of life and property.  This leaves open the possibility of force being used in the dwelling house in circumstances which are entirely non-threatening.  To retain such a provision in a statute would cause immense problems for the future.

Such a provision would affect the delicate balance in the existing law on the liability of occupiers in respect of the duties owed to those entering their property.  This would constitute a significant amendment to the provisions of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995.It would appear from section 5 that a defence of reasonable force in respect of the death of an intruder, which can be invoked where self-defence is pleaded, would not apply in the case of a person who killed an intruder in the home dwelling.  This would put an accused person in those circumstances at a distinct disadvantage with respect to an accused who may have killed an assailant when attacked at a location other than the home dwelling.  This is an extraordinary failure which underlines the many failures in this piece of legislation.Section 6(b) would mean that an occupier who intentionally or recklessly engaged in conduct which created a substantial risk of death to any person, whether that person was a trespasser or not, would not be liable to prosecution for endangerment under section 13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act if the conduct took place within the dwelling.  Such a measure would represent a significant change in the law from that which obtains at present, which is regarded as a fair and balanced legislative position.  This is a remarkable proposal by any standards.  What is being proposed is that an occupier may engage in reckless conduct even against someone who is not a trespasser — perhaps a guest at a party in the house or some other innocent person.  If the reckless and dangerous conduct takes place in the dwelling and the person who engages in it is the occupier, that would appear to be sufficient to allow this conduct to be undertaken with impunity.Section 7 sets out the matters which are to be taken into account when determining whether the force used was reasonable.  All but one of the four considerations are on the objective standard.  The law, as it stands, in relation to the use of force as a method of self-defence is on the subjective standard.  I am of the view that the present state of the law in this regard may be better for a person who might use force against an intruder as the test is currently subjective.  That is to say that a person can use force which he or she feels is necessary in light of the level of danger that person believes himself or herself to be in at the time.  In light of the current provisions of section 18 of the 1997 Act, the presumption proposed in this Bill is, in my view, unnecessary. As the presumption is unnecessary, other provisions which regulate the application of the presumption are consequently also unnecessary.One of the major flaws in the Bill is in regard to the issue of curtilage.  I note it does not deal with the issue of what is defined as the curtilage of the dwelling house, that is the area immediately surrounding the dwelling.  In some respects I can understand the reasons for avoiding this issue as it is too complex for this legislative effort.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that trespass can also occur and an occupier could be in danger from a trespasser in a garden or in a place on the occupier's property immediately adjacent to the dwelling house.  The difficulty is defining and limiting the extent of the curtilage of a property.  This is a matter that may have to be given further careful consideration.  I would like to think that the Law Reform Commission will come up with some view in that regard and I understand it will.  The danger of an abuse of the concept of curtilage is always possible, particularly if an incident took place on the property of the occupier but if the property in question contained a parcel of land that was a considerable distance from the home.  In the context of the castle doctrine, which is a significant feature of the US legal system, the case law has tended to be inconsistent.  In one case, Beard  v. United States in 1903, the court held that a defender was not obliged to retreat from an attack carried out in a field some 50 or 60 yards from his dwelling house.  Faced with a similar case some years later the Florida Supreme Court in 1907 held that a defender was obliged to retreat notwithstanding that he was working in his field about 200 to 300 yards from his house.  This is a matter which has yet to be addressed by Irish law.  However, it cannot be ignored that it is necessary to deal with this issue in the Bill.  For example, if a conflict between an intruder and an occupier moved from the house to the garden, it would appear that the occupier would lose the protection which is being offered to him or her under this Bill because the conflict is no longer taking place in the dwelling house.  That is a fundamental flaw in this Bill.  That is why the issue of curtilage needs to be addressed.Fundamentally what has to be considered by the House in the context of this issue is how effectively the current legislation works and the need, if any, for legislative change to address particular aspects relating to situations which arise involving occupiers and intruders.No situation involving assault is ever normal.  In the context of an assault in the home, regard must be had to the unique circumstances which prevail when an intruder is being dealt with in the place where we all have a right to consider to be a place of safety.The Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper in 2006 on the subject of legitimate defence.  This publication was part of a series which is being undertaken by the commission into aspects of the law on homicide in this jurisdiction.  It is worth bearing in mind that the consultation paper made a clear distinction between the application of defence in connection with attack on the home dwelling and the use of self-defence in the context of an attack in other circumstances.  The Law Reform Commission recommends that "a defender should not be required to retreat from an attack in their dwelling house even if they could do so with complete safety".  The commission's consultation paper is a useful document and it is currently finalising its report.  On checking with the commission yesterday, we learned that its report will be published before the end of this year.  I understand its report will contain specific recommendations on the issue of the application of legitimate defence in the context of an intruder in the dwelling home and also in the curtilage of it.  In line with the practice of the Law Reform Commission, it will produce a draft Bill on the issues contained in its report.While it is opportune to discuss this issue in a dispassionate way, I genuinely believe we should await the Law Reform Commission report, which will issue before the end of the year, and on receipt of its draft Bill, which will be accompanied by that report, we can examine it as the grounding legislation on this matter, which the Oireachtas can discuss and hopefully pass.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	128	There is understandable public concern as to whether current legislation, namely, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, is correctly balanced between rights of the homeowner and someone who trespasses into his or her home with criminal intent.  This issue has generated considerable debate both in this jurisdiction and elsewhere in recent years.The Fine Gael Party does not have a monopoly on concern over this issue.  The Government has also taken a constructive and considered approach to the issue and it will continue to do so.  However, we should bear in mind that the citizen currently has the protection of the law if he or she defends himself or herself against attack in the home or elsewhere.  Self-defence is a long held legal principle and it is provided for in the 1997 Act.Our Constitution imposes a duty on the State to protect by its laws, as best it may, its citizens from unjust attack and in the case of injustice done to vindicate the person of every citizen.  The bedrock of our law in relation to assault and the issue of self-defence in respect of someone who fears that he or she may be the victim of an assault is, as I said, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  I would like to place on the record of the House that this is effective and sound legislation and although it does not specifically deal with attacks which take place in the home, it deals with the issue of the use of force for the purposes of self-defence generally including incidents which might occur in the home.  As the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has pointed out, sections 18 and 20 of the 1997 Act make statutory provision in relation to the justifiable use of force to protect a person or property or to prevent a crime.  Section 18 sets out the various purposes for which justifiable force may be lawfully used which does not constitute an offence.  These purposes include the protection of the person or his or her family or another person from injury, assault or detention caused by a criminal act, protection of his or her property or property belonging to another from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act or from trespass or infringement and prevention of crime or a breach of the peace.  The force used must be reasonable by reference to the circumstances believed by the person to exist.Section 20 defines the meaning of "use of force" for the purposes of section 18 and subsection (4) provides that the fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account in conjunction with other relevant evidence in determining whether the use of force was reasonable.  Section 1(2) of the Act provides that for the purposes of section 18, it is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not, if it is honestly held.  This is a very important provision.  It means that if an individual is defending himself or herself from attack, he or she may apply the force he or she feels is reasonable to defend himself or herself effectively.  The presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the belief is a matter to which the court or jury is to have regard, in conjunction with any other relevant matters, when considering whether the person honestly held the belief.The current law clearly states that use of force is justifiable in certain circumstances and also clearly states what is reasonable "use of force".  It also provides that a belief of the need to protect does not have to be justified if honestly held and leaves this as a matter for the courts to decide.  The 1997 Act provides protection for the homeowner who finds himself or herself in the very stressful and difficult position of discovering an intruder in his or her home.  This legislation has served us well to date.  It provides a very well thought out balance between the need to be able to protect ourselves, our families and our property from potential danger and the need for us to be accountable for the actions we take in such a situation if we go too far.The purpose of Deputy Flanagan's Bill is to provide protection for home occupiers who confront intruders and-or trespassers in their homes.  It proposes to create a rebuttable presumption that any force used by an occupier in such circumstances to protect his or her home or family is reasonable and comprises protection from civil liability for the actions of a home occupier in all circumstances. The Bill would get rid of any obligation on occupiers to retreat from confronting intruders in their homes.  Where an occupier uses force against an intruder the Bill would allow a jury to consider certain factors set out in section 7 when coming to a decision on the reasonableness or otherwise of the occupier's actions.  These factors include such matters as whether the occupier had family members in the dwelling, whether there was sufficient time to decide on a course of action and whether the options for defence against a trespasser were limited.Section 3 creates the rebuttable presumption that the force used was reasonable, where the occupier uses force against a trespasser who has gained unlawful entry to, and remains within, his or her home.  Under section 4, no civil liability on the part of the occupier shall arise in respect of any harm, whether serious or not, caused by the actions referred to in section 3.  Moreover, section 7 requires the court, in determining whether the occupier's actions were reasonable, to take into account the particular factors described in the section.Our primary legislation in the area of occupier's liability is the Occupiers Liability Act 1995.  That Act reduces the extent of the occupier's obligations to trespassers.  It provides that an occupier owes a duty not to injure a trespasser intentionally and not to act with reckless disregard.  The Act also provides that where a person enters onto a premises for the purpose of committing an offence or, while there, commits an offence, the occupier is not liable for a breach of the duty imposed generally on trespassers unless a court decides otherwise in the interests of justice.  Additionally, section 8(a) gives the occupier an entitlement to use proportionate force for his or her self defence, the defence of others or the defence of property.The occupier is not required to discharge the standard of reasonable care which visitors can insist on under the 1995 Act.  When considering whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard for a trespasser on his or her property, a court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case.  These include the behaviour of the person and the nature of any warning given by the occupier.  It is also worth remembering that section 57(1) of the Civil Liability Act 1961 provides that it shall not be a defence in an action of tort to show that the plaintiff is in breach of the civil or criminal law.Deputy Charles Flanagan's Bill appears to assume reasonableness in potentially dangerous situations on the part of the occupier and places the burden of disproving that presumption on the trespasser.  In attempting this, drafting difficulties arise with the Bill and questions remain to be answered about the extent to which section 4 gives occupiers' exemption from all civil liability.  These matters would in my view upset the delicate legal balance which is contained in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995 and it would be most unwise to interfere with this legislation without the most careful consideration.Section 18(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 clearly states the purposes for which force could be lawfully used.  Deputy Charles Flanagan's Bill fails to do that.  This Bill appears to significantly widen the circumstances in which force could be lawfully used.  There is no mention in it of the protection of life or the protection of property.  The Bill would also significantly reduce the ability of the court or jury to decide upon the reasonableness of the actions of the accused.Section 5 confines the provisions of the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2009 to non-fatal offences.  Section 6 would amend the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 by adding new definitions and providing that no occupier has a duty to retreat before using force within his or her home.  I have some sympathy with the provision on the issue of retreat.  The Minister has already outlined some of the difficulties that can arise if a person is required to retreat from his or her own home in the face of an intruder.  If further legislation is required on this matter the Government will not hesitate to provide it.  We would be well advised to consider the matter again in light of the Law Reform Commission's work.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Listening to the debate so far one cannot but be struck by the realisation that there is a serious clash between what the law provides, in particular the common law, and the view of the ordinary citizen who is confronted by an intruder with criminal intent in the family home.  There is no doubt at all but that there is considerable fear about the extent of intrusions that we have read about and experienced in recent years.  In that regard it is very helpful that Fine Gael has put this issue on the agenda because while reference has been made to Border counties and rural areas the fact of the matter is that the phenomenon of people feeling vulnerable in their own homes is not restricted to those areas alone.  Many people have experienced burglaries with intent or worse.  There was a particularly gruesome case in a block of apartments on the north side of Dublin recently.  It highlights the extent to which people are fearful for their personal safety and cannot enjoy their homes in such circumstances.  That perception clashes to some degree with the law, which is very detailed and which has stood the test of time in this regard.The fact that in rural areas in particular we have seen such gruesome incidents in recent years where people living in isolated and vulnerable circumstances have been attacked in their own homes, usually for the purpose of burglary and where violence has been inflicted on helpless people in those circumstances, is something that we in this House have a duty to discuss.  In so doing we must examine whether the law is defective in any way.  The Minister has conceded as much and has admitted that he understands that this is the reality.  I interpret what he has said as a commitment to the extent that if the Law Reform Commission completes its business before the year is out and produces a draft Bill that it will be introduced in this House without undue delay.  Otherwise, I am satisfied for the Fine Gael Bill to proceed to Committee Stage in this House.  The Labour Party has reservations about some of the provisions in the Bill and agrees with some of the points raised by the Minister.  We often shoot down — if that is not an inappropriate term in this case — Private Members' Bills advanced in this House when they could easily be improved upon or amended in committee to deal with existing social problems.  The consultation paper published by the Law Reform Commission indicates to me that the Law Reform Commission itself acknowledges that there may be a necessity to update the law in this regard.In regard to the section on which the Minister concentrated, it appears to me that the Law Reform Commission, in its consultation paper, makes a distinction between the application of defence in connection with attack on the home dwelling and the use of self defence in the context of any other circumstance.  It states that a defender should not be required to retreat from an attack in their dwelling house even if they could do so with complete safety.  The provisional recommendation also states that the dwelling house should be defined as including the curtilage or area immediately surrounding the home.It is some time since I read the Law Reform Commission report on legitimate defence.  However, there is an awareness of the problem that we are seeking to highlight here.  If the Law Reform Commission continues its practice of recent times of accompanying its report with a draft Bill, I believe it should be introduced in this House without undue delay.  Fear in the countryside in particular is greatly exacerbated by the absence of policing in the traditional manner.  So many rural Garda stations have been closed or are essentially inoperable.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has not set out his views today in regard to how he views the recommendations in the report of an bord snip nua in the particular matter of Garda stations.  Traditional community-style policing and the patrolling of neighbourhoods and so on has virtually vanished from our cities.  It is difficult for remote communities to feel assured in terms of the closure of Garda stations in their areas in recent years.  This is adding to the real fear that exists in rural communities.It is appropriate that we are discussing this legislation in a calmer environment than was the case when it was last discussed by the House a few years ago.  We should not in any way play down the real fear among people, in particular senior citizens living in isolated conditions, for their personal safety.  Whether this is a matter of adequate policing, the introduction of other measures or for refurbishment of the criminal law, this House should be prepared to do its duty in that regard.I am reminded that when Rumpole of the Bailey went to court to defend his clients he would always resort to a passage about the golden thread that runs through the criminal justice system, quoting from the famous Woolmington case of 1935:Throughout the web of English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen — that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt...If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.  No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.This is also the case in Irish law deriving from common law and reinforced by our Constitution.  However, there are exceptions to the golden thread rule, namely, insanity and expressed statutory exceptions.  There is nothing preventing this House, based on professional advice from the Law Reform Commission, examining this point.  There is no doubt but that this Bill is highlighting a real and serious fear in the community, in particular among our senior citizens, especially those living alone.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Deputy Flanagan, when introducing this legislation, said that it did not encourage occupiers to take action and it was intended to reassure occupiers of homes that the law is on their side.  However, I am concerned that the legislation as drafted might encourage occupiers to take action and use force.  It sends out a signal that the use of force in itself is a reasonable response.  I am concerned this would normalise the use of force by occupiers on intruders.I accept the legislation does not go as far as that which supports the type of view that is held in this regard in the United States.  The Minister referred to the Castle doctrine.  We know from what we learn about the United States that there appears to be a widespread view that one should protect one's home and in this regard many people there keep guns in their home for personal protection.  While I am not suggesting the Bill promotes this type of approach, it might encourage some people here to keep weapons, presumably legally, such as guns or knives in their home.  When one goes down this route there is a much greater danger that people other than trespassers will be injured by those weapons.  A Fine Gael Member previously referred in this House to a person who kept an ornamental sword in the home.Another issue of concern for me is the definition of "trespasser", which is very broad.  Deputy Flanagan stated that Fine Gael has amended the definition of "trespasser" since 2006.  However, I am concerned about the manner in which it has been amended.  In this Bill, "trespasser" is defined in the broadest sense.  The amendment states that a trespasser includes a person who enters a property with a lawful licence and whose presence becomes unlawful by violation of the express or implied terms of that licence.  This, in effect, allows the occupier to decide at some point that the person is a trespasser, which could be an unreasonable decision on the part of the occupier or a misunderstanding on his or her part.  However, such a person would be protected by the provisions of this Bill.  I believe the amendment of the definition of "trespasser" has made the definition broader.  It means that a unilateral decision can be taken at any time by the occupier of the House that a person is a trespasser against whom he or she can use force.The Minister mentioned — this was also mentioned by former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell — that a trespasser could be a child.  A child might not realise or understand he or she is a trespasser and is unlawfully on another's premises.  There are also many other types of people who may not view themselves as trespassers.  There is nothing in the Bill that requires that a trespasser need have any criminal intent.  In other words, it might not necessarily be a burglar or a person who intends to cause injury or damage that will be covered under the definition of "trespasser" in this Bill.  For example, the former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, referred in 2006 to the possibility that a party gate-crasher might be defined as a trespasser.  Newspaper reports regularly refer to incidents arising out of the gate-crashing of parties.Similarly, I have a difficulty with the definition of "occupier" in the legislation.  This might apply to persons on the premises at the consent of the owner.  The example given by Mr. McDowell in this regard was party guests.  The definition of "occupier" is broad enough potentially to encompass persons not connected with the owners of a particular property.  Such persons could enjoy protection under the provisions of the Bill where they cause serious harm to a person considered a "trespasser", who may be a child or a party gate-crasher.  I am not aware that there has been a sudden increase in prosecutions of home owners for using force against trespassers.  A recent case relevant to this legislation was the Nally case, in which instance the defendant was found not guilty following an appeal.As it stands, our law incorporates checks and balances.  I am concerned that Fine Gael's proposal would send out the signal that force is an option rather than a last resort.  Sending out the message that force is an option may lead to more prosecutions against occupiers for use of force because more of them will be of the view that this is the way to go.  There is currently a widespread view that the use of force is not necessarily a wise course of action in this type of situation.  The Minister referred to the principle of avoidance in this regard.  The general perception is that one should not endanger oneself or one's family by using force unless there are no other options.My other difficulty with Fine Gael's promotion of this Bill is the notion that its provisions would make intruders think twice.  The premise is that potential burglars would desist from criminal activity for fear of being injured by the occupier and because they would be unable to sue for any such injury.  I am not convinced this principle would be effective in practice.  The way to deter burglars and those who intend to harm others or cause damage to property is by ensuring they are fearful of being caught, prosecuted and convicted.  The important issues in this regard are a good Garda presence, efficient Garda methods and ensuring those who commit such offences are tried and convicted.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to older people in both urban and rural areas who are particularly vulnerable to attack.  During the last election campaign I met an 80 year old woman whose home had been burgled twice in a matter of weeks and who had been assaulted in the course of one of these intrusions.  Her house was not alarmed, she lived alone and felt isolated, even though her home was on a housing estate.  We must do more to ensure older people are not isolated in their communities and are offered supports.  Funding for personal alarms for older people should not be withdrawn.The Bill would effect a fundamental change regarding the desirability of retreat as a primary option for occupiers who are faced with intruders.  This sends the wrong signal.  There is a possibility occupiers may make a mistake in regard to the nature of the trespasser and the threat posed by him or her.  There is often only a split second in which a decision must be made as to what action to take against a trespasser and what could be deemed reasonable force in the particular situation.  However, this Bill positively promotes the taking of force.  This may make it more likely for a person to decide, in that split second, to use force.  This is not something that should be encouraged.The Bill stipulates that its provisions regarding reasonable force cannot be used as a defence to murder.  I understand the reasons that there has been a modification in respect of manslaughter.  However, it will be open to a person to use reasonable force as a defence where he or she has caused serious injury to another intentionally.  Will a person who has caused grievous bodily harm to another in these types of circumstances be allowed to claim the defence of reasonable force?  I have difficulty with this provision.The Bill provides that a trespasser who has suffered harm, whether serious or not, cannot take action against the perpetrator unless it can be shown that the force used by the latter was unreasonable.  However, the provisions in this regard are broad.  What will happen, for example, where the trespasser is a child?  The force used by an occupier against a child trespasser may not be considered unreasonable under the provisions of this Bill but most of us would agree it would be morally wrong to use force against a child.  The Bill does not protect children in those circumstances.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that we should await the report of the Law Reform Commission.  There are certainly concerns to be addressed regarding the law as it currently stands; hopefully the commission will provide guidance in this regard.  I have serious concerns about the proposal put forward by Fine Gael.

Tá sé cosúil leis an Bhille a cuireadh os ár gcomhair anseo mí Meithimh 2006, Bille a chuir an Teachta Jim O'Keeffe os comhair an Tí.  Ag an am chuir mé ina choinne agus is oth liom a rá arís go mbeidh mé ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo de thairbhe nach bhfuil smaoineamh déanta ar an méid atá Fine Gael ag iarraidh a chur trasna sa Bhille um an Dlí Coiriúil (Cosaint Tí Cónaithe) 2009.  Tá i bhfad níos mó smaoinimh le déanamh ar an cheist seo go mbeimid in ann teacht suas le Bille a chuirfidh san áireamh go díreach na ceisteanna móra atá na Teachtaithe a chuir an Bille seo os ár gcomhair ag triall a chur trasna.As I said in 2006 when discussing the home defence Bill presented by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the law must always seek to strike a balance between the rights of victims and those of alleged criminals.  We must never forget that the premise which fundamentally underlines our justice system is the presumption of innocence until a person is proven guilty.  The problem with this Bill is that it sends out the message to householders that they should act as judge, jury and executioner, albeit it does not allow for a defence to murder.  It seems to suggest that any person who is found on another's property, whether guilty or not of the crime of trespass, may reasonably be subject to punishment by a kicking or worse.Deputy Tuffy made an important point regarding the definition of trespass.  There are many cases in which a trespasser does not have malicious intent.  For example, a trespasser could be a family member who disputes the ownership of a land or property in a case of probate and wishes to assert his or her perceived rights.  The trespasser may be a squatter who does not pose a threat to the occupier because the latter may not have been at home when he or she moved in to a premises.  An improved definition of the word "trespasser" is, therefore, required.The Bill is obviously intended to address circumstances in which a person is trespassing with intent to do damage or injure.  Increasing levels of violence are being perpetrated by burglars in homes across the country, whether in isolated rural areas or urban centres.  A significant number of elderly people in a particular part of my constituency have had their homes broken into.  Thankfully in the cases with which I am familiar, none of the victims was assaulted, although they had the fear of God put into them by these burglaries and have been left afraid to continue living alone.  This is one of the serious consequences of break-ins.  It is bad enough to lose valuable property or a family heirloom.  What is worse, however, is that victims often become afraid to continue living in their home.In one recent case, the victim of a break-in, a woman who had lost her husband the previous year, was so traumatised that her family found it necessary to move her to a nursing home.  Victim impact statements need to be used against criminals involved in break-ins to ensure they understand the full consequences of their actions and judges must take into account the impact of burglaries on old and vulnerable people.  The impact of a break-in extends beyond a window being broken to gain access or a watch or wad of money being robbed.The number of robberies is increasing as a consequence of the recession and increasing prevalence of drugs.  Drug addicts use robberies as a tactic to obtain money to feed their drug habits.  With burglars becoming more violent and ruthless, it is vital that such criminals be subject to the full rigours of the law when arrested and brought before the courts.The danger with this type of legislation is that it encourages what are known as "have-a-go heroes", including people who may not be able to stand up to intruders, to come downstairs wielding an implement, with the result that a violent confrontation ensues.  The proper response should be to call the Garda Síochána.  This would be possible if the Garda was properly resourced but the problem, especially in rural areas, is that more and more local Garda stations are empty at nights, weekends and in some cases during the week.  Moreover, Garda equipment is not up to scratch, for example, the promised digital radio system has still not been rolled out.  We also need more gardaí to be released from duties that could be undertaken by civilians.  A recent media report indicated that we have failed to meet the target for civilianisation, a process which would release more gardaí to engage in duties such as responding quickly and effectively to alarm calls made by people who believe their homes are under attack by burglars.  As other Deputies have noted, greater investment is required in security for the elderly and those living in isolated areas to discourage attempts to break in to their homes.We need to take a cautious approach to legislation of this nature and understand what would be the consequences of its enactment.  One of the key dangers is that the Bill would increase conflict and violence during break-ins.  One woman informed me that she woke up to find a person she did not know staring down at her.  Not understanding the consequences of her actions, she screamed out and a hand was place over her face.  If this legislation had been in force at that time, the woman in question may have had a knife or other weapon concealed under her pillow and may have used it to lash out at the intruder.  She would then have had to face the consequences of her actions.  The Bill does not provide a basis for mounting a defence in the case of murder, although in the case of a woman who lashes out with a knife and kills an intruder, the offence would probably be manslaughter.  Nevertheless, taking an implement such as a knife upstairs implies premeditation and an intention to use it.  The outworkings and consequences of this scenario have not been adequately addressed.This three page Bill does not do justice to the issue involved.  I encourage the Fine Gael Party Deputies to go back to the drawing board and consider the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission when it reports to determine whether it is possible to address some of the problems I and others have identified.  On that basis, a Bill could be introduced to protect victims, while leaving intact the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, one of the cornerstones of our justice system.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I wish to share time with Deputies Conlon, Collins and Johnny Brady.The subject matter of the Bill before the House is of considerable interest to Members and citizens.  It is also an issue in which I have a keen interest.  We are all aware of cases in which persons have entered a house or property without adequate excuse and with criminal intent, resulting in injury or death.  Such cases have fuelled a debate on whether the law strikes the right balance between the rights of an occupier and those of a trespasser.  There is a genuinely held view that while the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 legislates adequately for a case of self-defence in most circumstances, it does not give protection to a person who finds intruders entering his or her home with criminal intent.  While I am fully aware of the efficacy of the current legislation, I also share the understandable public concern that the best legislative resources should be made available to provide for the protection of the home or dwelling.I am a firm believer in the need for tough legislative provisions to combat all types of criminal activity and make no apology for fully supporting legislation passed in the previous Dáil session to deal with a wide spectrum of criminal law.  The Bill before us is not adequate, well thought out or sufficiently strong to justify my support.  It is, in effect, a copy of an earlier Bill introduced in 2006 and contains a number of a flaws which would make it inoperable for the purpose for which it is intended.  For example, the term "dwelling house" does not include the curtilage or area immediately surrounding a home.  This is a major flaw because an intruder may not have entered a home but may be in a person's yard or, in the case of farmers, adjoining farmhouses or other parts of the property in which the farmer attends to his or her lawful business.A further flaw in the legislation is its failure to make distinctions between types of trespassers, for example, between a young person who may stray onto a property and a bogus caller who uses a sales pitch as a pretext to access the property.  On many occasions they are not legitimate sales people and, as many others have found, it is difficult to dislodge them, whether from a house, farmyard or an adjacent area.The special status of a home or dwelling has always been linked to the dignity of the individual.  An attack in the home has unique characteristics and is very different from other forms of attack.  Given the potentially emotive nature of such an encounter, I suspect that a great many people share this opinion.  As we are all aware, Article 40.5 of the Constitution contains a specific provision that "the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law".References have been made to pendant alarms.  As a board member of Muintir na Tire, which runs the national community alert programme, I am disappointed that the scheme has been suspended.  It has not been ended by any means, but it is subject to review.  I have made submissions to that review, as has Munitir na Tire and I hope many more interested parties will do so.  Pendant alarms constitute a vital piece of equipment,  especially for the elderly and other vulnerable people.  The scheme was subject to a lot of abuse, however, and was not effective.  There are only three suppliers.  I know one of them had a spot check of over 5,000 pendants, which were fitted at enormous cost to the taxpayer, but they were lying dormant because the annual monitoring charge had not been paid.  This is a shameful waste.  The money would be better spent if the monitoring fees were paid for by the Department on an ongoing basis.  It is pointless having this infrastructural investment if the pendants are not being used.The proposals of an bord snip nua from Mr. McCarthy and his Dublin 4 friends must be rejected out of hand.  They have forgotten about rural Ireland.  We must support the gardaí who do a difficult job.  They need our support and the community alert scheme strives to bolster the relationship between such organisations, the public and An Garda Síochána.  There is no replacement for the Garda on the beat, who has time to have a cup of tea and a chat with people, especially those living alone.  It is also important that gardaí visit schools, thus engendering a respect for the law among young people.  We must maintain and nurture that relationship.  The removal of any more Garda stations and allied resources would be a huge blow in that respect.  Gardaí cannot solve crimes without community support.  That is one of the reasons this Bill is somewhat premature.  We should all examine the matter together to try to perfect the legislation which deals with a hugely emotive issue.Many people cannot sleep properly, especially with the onset of autumn.  In addition, when the clocks go back next month, it will get dark at 5 p.m. so people living alone will have a long period during which they will see nobody else.  With the removal of some postal services, people living alone may not receive visits from anybody.I am currently involved, as are others around the country, in establishing a listening service called Good Morning South Tipperary.  Data from companies monitoring pendant alarms show that many people use such pendants not because of attacks or accidents but due to sheer loneliness and isolation.  We have found from telephoning such people that they are happy to engage in conversation.  Their faces light up and they are in a better state of mind and health when they have contact with others.  People who have peace of mind are more relaxed and healthy, which in itself reduces health care costs.Everyone is entitled to be considered innocent until proven guilty, and we must respect that legal tenet at all times.  However, I have serious concerns having had considerable experience of the court system following my own incident.  The situation in the courts is very frustrating and some cases can continue for ten years.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  It is also frustrating for gardaí when they have a book of evidence, yet cases cannot come to court.The free legal aid area has been totally abused and ripped off.  People with previous records have availed of free legal aid, but that service should be denied to them.  There should be some recompense whereby they must pay their share.  I am not talking about those who are innocent and have not been convicted.We should all stick together to try to get a comprehensive Bill to deal with these matters.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	135	A few years ago, a couple of high profile cases in Ireland and the UK succeeded in putting the issue of protecting individuals, families and property in one's own home at the top of the agenda.  These legal cases also highlighted what has long since been an issue for many people in rural Ireland — that is, the fear and vulnerability that many rural dwellers, and particularly older people, feel living alone.  The threat of intrusion looms large for many people and the high profile cases I mentioned have probably exacerbated this fear.From the way the Fine Gael Party is talking, one would think there is no legislation in this area, but that is incorrect.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 sets out clearly that home-owners are entitled to use reasonable force in protecting themselves and their property.  In addition, in a recent judgment Mr. Justice Hardiman stated:The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression.  The violation of a citizen's dwelling house is just that, a violation and act of aggression, no matter what the other circumstances ... Although he is not liable to be killed by the householder simply for being a burglar, he is an aggressor and may expect to be lawfully met with retaliatory force to drive him off or to immobilise or detain him and end the threat which he offers to the personal rights of the householder and his or her family or guests.  And this is so whether the dwellinghouse which he enters is, or appears to be, occupied or unoccupied when he breaks into it.Therefore, contrary to what Fine Gael would have us believe, the role of the victim is protected and the law does not favour the criminal.  That said, there are still anomalies in this area.  We must strike the right balance between allowing home-dwellers to protect themselves and their family, as well as their property, while avoiding a legalisation of the shoot-to-kill approach.In recognition of some of the anomalies in this area, in 2006, the Law Reform Commission made a number of recommendations in its consultation paper.  It suggested that innocent defenders may only resort to lethal defensive force in response to a threat where they are unable to retreat with complete safety from that threat.  In line with recent case law, the commission recognised that a defender should not be required to retreat from an attack in their dwelling home even if they could do so with complete safety.  The commission found that lethal defensive force should not be used in defence of personal property.  It does not recommend that any upper limit be placed on the force that may be used to defend one's dwelling house.I will not go into the shortcomings of the Fine Gael Bill as I agree with the Minister's arguments.  This is a complex subject and any errors or oversights could have huge repercussions.  A gentleman's home is his castle and we are all entitled to feel safe and secure in our homes.  Likewise, we must be able to exercise due force when our sanctuary is threatened.  Greater clarity regarding what is reasonable force is needed.  I look forward to the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming proposals on this issue and that is why I will be not be voting in favour of this proposed legislation.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am grateful for the opportunity to partake in this important debate because all of us are united about progressing legislation to protect our law abiding citizenship.  It is unfortunate, given the downturn in the economy, that an upturn in crime is being experienced, particularly in rural Ireland.  There is no point shying away from it.  Fear is widespread and as a Member representing a rural constituency, I am well aware of the fear experienced by senior citizens, in particular, living in isolated parts of County Limerick.  Regrettably, I am contacted on too many occasions by them to report incidents and I try to advise and work with them and with State agencies.  Recently in the parish of Fedamore, County Limerick, near my home, a lady woke up in the middle of the night to find her car the subject of an arson attack outside her front door.  Her insurance company provided her with a replacement car the following day but that night, the car was also burned out.  The company will not provide with her with another replacement car and she is potentially uninsurable.  She must do without a car until the perpetrator of the crimes is brought to justice. The gardaí are effective in County Limerick and they deal with various cases efficiently, for which I thank them.  Agencies such as Victim Support deserve our assistance and they should be given credit because they provide significant support to the victims of crime.The Government, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin seem to be at one regarding this issue and we should all get together and advance legislation on foot of recommendations due shortly from the Law Reform Commission.  Reservations have been raised about the issue of reasonable force and the definition of the "curtilage of one's property".  This is relevant in rural areas, particularly for those who own farms and outbuildings.  Experience can be drawn from a number of high profile cases involving people in rural areas in recent years.  It is important to get this right because failure to do so could result in people hiding behind legislation.The Garda has become proactive in interacting with local community groups in my constituency.  Last Monday, more than 100 people met gardaí at a meeting in Shanagolden.  The gardaí were able to take them through crime statistics for Shanagolden and Foynes, which were generated through investment in the PULSE information system.  It is important that community representatives can talk to gardaí about hard facts and figures because hysteria and misinformation about crime levels often take over.  It is important that gardaí can produce hard facts and figures about crime levels and detection rates to reassure communities.  The Garda is also proactive in the roll-out of the neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes, which is also important.  An bord snip nua made a recommendation about the future use of rural Garda stations and the House must engage in a serious debate on this issue.  Many stations lie idle but do we want increased investment in human resources in order that more gardaí are on the beat or do we want to tie up resources in land and buildings?I echo the comments about the free legal aid scheme.  A fundamental root and branch review of the scheme is needed because the balance is tipped in favour of the perpetrators of crime who use it on multiple occasions and against the victims of crime.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Every citizen is entitled to live in his or her home without fear of intrusion.  We all know constituents — some of us have had personal experience — who have experienced such intrusions and they bear the scars forever.  We should do everything we can to ensure such criminal activity is reduced.I support Deputy Mattie McGrath's comments regarding pendant alarms for elderly and vulnerable people.  They are a tremendous asset for them and it is most important that they know somebody is at the end of a telephone line when a crisis occurs.  I also support Deputy Collins's comments regarding the Garda.  Members of the force do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances.  Crime prevention officers in my constituency are extremely busy meeting community groups to discuss how people can make their homes safer.The Law Reform Commission is due to report shortly on a number of issues relating to homicides, including the defence of a home dwelling, and a draft Bill will be published before the end of the year.  It is a little premature for Fine Gael to bring forward this legislation in advance of the report and its recommendations.  The LRC is considering the issue of legitimate defence.  In November 2006 it published a consultation paper on the issue, which included consideration of issues relevant to this topic.  What is the benefit in having the LRC report pending and all the work that went into it if we pre-empt the commission by publishing a Bill that may include some or all of its recommendations?  I urge the Minister to carefully analyse and evaluate all of the commission's proposals.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights should discuss the report in great detail.Furthermore, there have been important case law-led legal developments.  It is currently a matter for a court and a jury to decide in cases of attacks in the home whether the force used was reasonable on the facts of the specific case.  In December 2006 Mr. Justice Hardiman dealt with the issue of permissible response to an attack in the course of a burglary in the 2006 case, DPP v. Barnes.  The judgment stated: “Every burglary in a dwelling house is an act of aggression . . . It is quite inconsistent that a householder could ever be under a legal obligation to flee their own dwelling house.”  This is correct.  When should an invader of a private house ever have equal or superior rights to the lawful occupant?  Legislation is required to defend one’s rights and punish others and if individuals trespass or invade other people’s private property, they should have little defence as they have made a conscious decision as to where they should go.  We must protect people in their own homes and I hope this is the guiding principle of the LRC report.Many issues relating to the Bill must be discussed.  In the case of self-defence, the test under existing law is subjective.  That means a person may act depending on the danger he or she feels he or she is in.  The purpose of section 5 is to ensure no provision in the legislation can be used as a defence for murder.  How would this work in practice?  It is woolly and unclear.  Section 4 would affect the Occupiers Liability Act 1995.  There is also an inconsistency in applying a criminal standard in section 7 when we see a civil standard in tort liability.  It reflects a Bill which was not fully thought out and was rushed, which is never the basis for effective legislation.The Bill does not address the issue of the curtilage of the dwelling.  How far outside the dwelling is its immediate area?  Will the Bill leave this up to the judge to interpret?  If that is the case it defeats the argument for the necessity of the Bill.  I see the rationale behind why the Fine Gael spokesperson brought forth this Bill.  There is a need for greater legal certainty but the Bill does not provide that.  I urge the Minister to provide a level of certainty, security and peace of mind to homeowners the length and breadth of the country.

I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  The Ceann Comhairle will note I am the only Dublin person among the five speakers.  I am anxious to make that point.  I support the views my colleagues expressed regarding rural policing and difficulties but I represent a mainly urban constituency, although there are rural voters in Bohernabreena and Brittas and I am happy to support their views.I compliment Deputy Flanagan and his colleagues in Fine Gael on giving us the opportunity to raise issues about which I know, from listening to the debate, we are all concerned.  It was decided not to proceed with legislation on this issue for the present, pending the publication, as my previous colleague said, of a Law Reform Commission report on legitimate defence.  A consultation paper was published in November 2006 which includes consideration of issues relevant to this topic and a Law Reform Commission report on a number of issues related to homicide, including defence of the home dwelling, along with a draft Bill, is due to be published before the end of 2009.  I am told it would be premature to advance proposals on the topic before that report is published.I will not disagree with this Bill — it is an issue of great concern to many of us.  I have heard other colleagues make the point that we need to support the Garda in our communities.  Some of the House will know I live in Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country.  Like everywhere else we face challenges as far as security and crime are concerned.  At the South Dublin County policing board last Friday I took the opportunity, which I am always happy to do, to strongly support the Garda in its efforts on behalf of my community and the wider community.  At that meeting we received a report which embraced the entire constituency.My constituency is served by Garda stations in Tallaght, Crumlin, Rathfarnham and Clondalkin and there are issues about that administration which I will continue to raise with the Minister.  We listened to a community report which referred to many issues of relevance as far as this Bill is concerned.  I support the concept and will press the Minister to take action in this area.  I appreciate the courtesy the Ceann Comhairle extended to me and I thank him.

I did not realise so many backbenchers were also out of touch.  The history of Private Members' Bills over the last number of years has been poor.  I did some research and in one 30 year period only three such Bills have been accepted.  On this occasion, this Bill is so important it should be considered.  From listening to the Minister and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers it is obvious it will not be considered.This Bill will benefit homeowners.  The appeal from Deputies Flanagan and O'Keeffe, who sponsored the 2006 Bill, was to let it go to committee and if it could be improved, similar to what the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said about the NAMA legislation, it would be.  I am satisfied that Fine Gael would be prepared for that to happen but, from listening to the other side of the House it will not happen.The Bill is a considered piece of legislation and the most important aspect of it relates to reasonable force.  Reasonable force is still the measure of force to be used regarding a burglary or trespass.  It has been long interpreted by case law as force that would be used by a reasonable man.This Bill transfers protection in law from the aggressor to the victim.  I was interviewed on a local radio station in Galway during the summer when the Bill was first published.  I must admit I did not realise the number of people who had no idea that if somebody breaks into their home and confronts them, the first thing they are obliged to do is retreat.  That is what the law currently states.  One must retreat.  If a victim does not retreat and confronts the person, he or she can be up in court.  It has happened in Ireland and in the UK.  That is wrong and we are reversing that point of law.We had a tour of Tallaght from Deputy O'Connor and I am sure there will be other tours from other Deputies.  Garda numbers are stretched more than ever.  The population is increasing and a significant number of people are leaving the force.  In my constituency of Wexford the population 30 years ago was a little over 70,000, it is now 140,000.  I spoke to a garda from Gorey who was leaving the force and he said Garda numbers in Gorey are similar to when he joined the force 20 years ago.The numbers can be managed to show there is a significant number of gardaí all over the place but that is not the case.  The Constitution protects the inviolability of the dwelling and the home.  The home is where we have our families, children and parents.  It is appalling that, under the current law, a person who breaks into a home has more protection in law than those who live there.  This Bill will change that.  I appeal to the other side of the House to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage and to put down amendments to improve it if they wish.  I look forward to that.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I congratulate Deputy Flanagan and his team on bringing this Bill before the House.  It is unfortunate that the Government will not support the Bill this afternoon because it is very fair and tilted in favour of the homeowner.  If somebody breaks into a home and there is clear criminal intent, the law should be tilted in favour of the homeowner and not the intruder.  For anybody that has been through this, there is nothing more dramatic than waking up and finding an intruder in one's home, and many victims never get over it.I understand Eircom Phonewatch did a survey recently and stated more than €100 million worth of goods were stolen from Irish homes between June 2007 and June 2008.  On average, nearly €4,000 was taken from each home during that period.  The same survey revealed the interesting fact that eight out of ten burglaries take place while the occupant is at home.  It is frightening for people to have this happen in their homes.  The figures have risen significantly since 2004, when only five out of ten burglaries were reported to have taken place when occupants were at home.In the past three years the number of burglary incidents reported to Claregalway division stations have grown from 316 in 2005 to 458 in 2007, with the rate of detected burglaries for the same period having increased from 55 in 2005 to 142 in 2007.  While I commend the Garda on the increase in detection rates, we could attain a higher rate of detection in our policing policy if the policy supported the maintenance of local rural Garda stations.The national CSO crime figures, which were published in February of this year, showed a similar trend.  Theft and related offences had increased by 2%, and burglary and related offences had increased by 4.5%.  Like many Deputies, I am aware of a spate of burglaries in my own constituency, particularly in rural and isolated areas, in recent months.  Elderly people and people who live alone are most vulnerable to such crimes.  In my own parish, an elderly man who lives on his own in an isolated area was recently attacked and tied up for the sake of €60 or €70.  It is a relatively common phenomenon.  If he had not freed himself, the consequences of the crime could have been much worse.The people of rural Ireland would sleep much more soundly in their beds if there were 24-hour manned Garda stations in their local areas.  There is a huge cloud over the future of many rural Garda stations.  The current trend is to concentrate Garda stations in urban areas, at the expense of rural communities.  The only 24-hour Garda stations in County Clare are in Ennis, Shannon, Kilrush, Killaloe and Ennistymon.  The other Garda stations open for just a few hours each day.  In recent months, I have received a number of calls from people who live in isolated parts of the county and are worried about the increased incidence of burglaries in their areas.  They are concerned that the short opening hours of their local Garda stations are resulting in gardaí having to travel long distances to respond to incidents.  It is sad that it takes gardaí a long time to respond to incidents in villages like Miltown Malbay, which is 13 km from Ennistymon, and Ballyvaughan, which is 25 km from Ennistymon.  The Government has turned a blind eye to the Garda Síochána's policy of increased urbanisation.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to review the strategy and to put gardaí back in our rural areas.The aim of this Bill is to tilt the balance in favour of the victim, rather than the criminal.  Surely one should be able to protect one's family when an intruder breaks into one's home with criminal intent.  This Bill will ensure that a jury will be able to consider one's specific circumstances at the time of the confrontation.  More importantly, it will provide protection from civil liability to people who potentially could be sued by a burglar.  Fine Gael is not suggesting that home owners should confront intruders.  On the contrary, we are proposing that legal protection should be afforded to home owners who find themselves in unavoidable situations when criminals enter their homes.  Everybody has the right to live in peace and to be safe in his or her home.  I urge the Government to reconsider this Bill, which favours the victim rather than the criminal.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I had an opportunity to address this matter when another Bill dealing with it was discussed in this House some years ago.  At that time, most Deputies called on the Government to take action in this area.  It is obvious that no action has been taken since then.  It is reasonable to expect the House to address the matter on this occasion.  The law as it stands is confusing.  Those who are attacked in their homes can find themselves in precarious circumstances.  It has happened to someone I know.Having listened to some of the speakers on the Government side of the House who have spoken about this issue - I do not refer to the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary - it is obvious that they have never come into contact with someone who has been attacked in his or her home.  Although this serious matter affects a relatively small number of people, our law should address it to some extent.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said that the Law Reform Commission will make some proposals this year and a Bill will be produced thereafter.  While I hope that will happen, I remind the House that it has been promised before.  When we discussed this matter in 2006, the then Minister said the same thing.  I would bet anything that it will not happen this year, even if the Government is still in place.  This serious issue can be addressed collectively by the House.  People on both sides of the House have a good knowledge of the law.  Some of them, like Deputy Creighton, have practised as barristers or as solicitors.  The manner in which this fairly considered Bill has been rejected today is symptomatic of the way this House does its business.  It was not accepted, as it could have been, because it was produced by the Opposition, which obviously cannot avail of the support of the Government's many parliamentary draftspeople and legal advisers.  I understand that Deputy Flanagan received a telephone call from the Minister's office, or from his Department, to the effect that this Bill would be accepted.  I do not know why there has been a change of mind in the meantime, but that is what has happened.  This legislation has been rejected by the Government for political reasons.  That is not a good way to do politics in this House.The most recent figures for crimes of this nature do not say where the burglaries in question occurred.  The figures for the second quarter of 2009 are alarming.  During that timeframe, there were 2,305 burglaries and related offences in the Dublin region.  By contrast, there were just 1,801 such offences during the same period in 2007.  The number of burglaries in the Dublin region increased by almost 500 between 2007 and 2009.  In the first quarter of 2007, there were no cases of aggravated burglary, which includes people breaking into houses, in the southern region.  There were ten such crimes in that region in the second quarter of 2009.  I am not being selective with the figures I am presenting to the House.  The reality is that these crimes are happening more often.  Repeat offenders know that the law is more or less on their side at this time.  They know that people who come across intruders have a sense of a doubt about what they can do to defend their homes.  They know that such people tend to think twice before they take action — they probably hide and hope these people go away.  Now that the Government has rejected Fine Gael's very good proposal, I appeal to it to ensure that the Law Reform Commission's report is published and that a Bill is introduced in this House by the end of the year, as promised by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words on this important and simple Bill.  It is right that it has been introduced at a time when no big court cases that would distort our discussions on this issue are taking place.  Despite all the madness that is taking place in respect of various issues, some of which are close to the heart and some of which are not, this is a good time to have a proper debate on legislation of this nature.  One would imagine that some leeway would be afforded to us as we try to engage in proper politics, but that has not happened so far today.  The Minister came in and tried to find something wrong with this proposal so that he would not have to accept an Opposition Bill.  Of course the Bill is not perfect — we do not have the expertise and advise of the Government's draftspeople to help us to put it together.  We introduced it in the hope that it would be discussed, amended and ultimately passed.  It is time for us to get something done in this regard.  Instead, the Minister came in and tried to suggest that the current law is good enough.  He said that further clarity is coming down the line and that a new Bill will be produced by the Government.  Although this issue was discussed three years ago — I am sure it was also debated many times before then — problems continue to be caused by the grey area that exists.  I hope the new Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will bring about change within the Government.  The people want a new kind of politics — they are fed up of the old kind.  They have had enough of the pathetic showmanship and argy-bargy of the past couple of years.  They want action to be taken.  If we do not start to do things in here, there will be a revolt some day soon.  Certain common sense things need to be done simply, without being complicated or dragged out over many years as they unbelievably have been.  It is time for us to wake up and start to get things done in this House.  This is an example of a simple problem that needs to be corrected and put right.If someone enters one's family home when one's partner and children are present, one is expected to walk away and retreat.  That is lunacy.  Who in their right minds would retreat and put their children in danger?  It is stupid to expect such a response.  The sooner we change that, the better because otherwise somebody else will end up in this situation.  It is bad enough that someone might end up in court for injuring an intruder but what if that person's child was injured because he or she retreated?  The responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the Members opposite if they do not act.People do not know what the law currently requires of them.  The Government has the duty to ensure that the law is clear.  This Bill attempts to set out in black and white what one can do.  An intruder has no business in someone else's home.  The garden and the adjoining football pitch are different issues because to enter a home, an intruder has to come through the door, window or, like Santa Claus, down the chimney.  One has a right to take action against anyone who enters one's home without permission.  We have a duty to enforce that right in law.This Bill is straightforward and deserves to be enacted.  In many parts of rural Ireland, people are afraid that someone might come up their driveways and through their doors.  As few rural Garda stations are manned 24 hours per day, people need the law to protect them in other ways.  The lack of resources means they cannot easily pick up the telephone and get a response from a Garda station.  Unemployed people who are trained in clerical work could easily be employed in Garda stations so that gardaí can be put on the streets.  We have discussed this issue for many years but we continue to deal with the politics of inaction.It is a pity that we have not moved with the times.  This week, the Ceann Comhairle reminded us about Dáil reform.  We have a duty to reform the Dáil so that we can react more quickly to issues even when the Government wishes to delay.  We are stuck with an old system which does not get things done, with the result that people suffer.  I urge Government Members to accept this Bill or else to introduce similar legislation.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Like my colleague, Deputy English, I did not come here to posture politically but to get things done.  In fairness to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Calleary, who is sitting opposite, he is of the same mind.  I was able to predict what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would say.  There are similarities to the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008, which was introduced by Deputy Timmins and subsequently dressed up in new clothes as Government legislation.  In reality, we could have dealt with it as mature adults.  Deputy English correctly noted that people expect more of us.This is a simple Bill.  Thankfully, I have been in the High Court on only a couple of occasions, where I watched barristers plead with judges in defence of their clients.  We are not supposed to act that way when we debate issues.  The Minister picked holes in our Bill and several Members, including Deputy Ó Snodaigh, have referred to the Law Reform Commission.  This matter is not even on the programme for Government.  It is a simple matter of shifting the onus of responsibility for proving a breach of the law onto the intruder.  The occupants of a house are not prepared for the intrusion.  It is like having to decide whether to brake or swerve when a cat or dog runs across the road in front of one's car.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh, in his softly-softly approach, suggested that if a woman believes she is entitled to refuse to retreat she may keep a knife under her pillow.  I do not know many women who hide knives under their pillows.  Most people are aware that the occupant is not always in the right because of the high profile cases that have come before the courts.The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 is contradictory in this regard.  On the one hand it requires that the force used be reasonable but, on the other, it provides that a jury may consider whether the accused had an opportunity to retreat from conflict.  If I stand on my landing and three bedrooms are occupied by my family members, it is not fair to ask me to retreat rather than try to protect them.  The onus to retreat should not be put on the occupant of the home.  The Bill clearly provides such a right within the house.  If one can chase an intruder, one also has time to dial 999.  Reasonable force is that which is needed to overpower an intruder.  That can be determined in a court if and when the Bill is tested.  Reasonable force does not entail inflicting unnecessary harm or hurt on an individual.  That is basic common sense.The new joint policing committee for County Wicklow recently held its inaugural meeting.  The chief superintendent who addressed the committee reported that robberies in the county have increased from 31 to 37, an increase of 19%.  Burglary and related offences went from 634 to 712, an increase of 92 cases or 15%.  An earlier speaker correctly attributed these increases partly to the economic situation.  People are taking desperate measures which they would not normally attempt.  Wicklow is on the doorstep of the biggest conurbation in the country and has two regional roads and a vast expanse of isolated upland territory.  We simply ask that this Bill be given reasonable consideration rather than parked like the Cluster Munitions Bill 2008.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	147	This is an extremely important Bill.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Barry Andrews, will be more aware than many of his colleagues of the principle in the criminal justice system that ignorance of the law is no defence.  However, that is difficult to explain in the circumstances outlined by my colleagues and when the Government admits that the law in respect of defence of the home is a grey area.  There is a lack of logic to some of the interpretations that have been made of the law.This Bill has two simple aims.  First, it achieves legal certainty and brings fairness and clarity.  Second, it allows people to have peace of mind in their own homes.  This is particularly important, as has been pointed out, for the elderly and for people who live in isolated areas but it is broader than that.  Many people, both in urban and rural areas, are concerned about the practicalities of how they can defend their homes and their families and they are entitled to peace of mind.There has been much reference to the Law Reform Commission.  I suppose it is pertinent to state that the Law Reform Commission has appealed for clarity on this aspect of the law.  The Law Reform Commission report states:A failure to specify rules of acceptable conduct clearly exposes accused persons to "the vagaries of juries" and "to gusts of public opinion".Therefore, the Law Reform Commission agrees with Fine Gael that there is a need for clarity in this area.There has been much confusion about why this legislation is required and I heard some dangerously emotive language from the Government benches.  Fine Gael is not stating, contrary to what some colleagues of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, have suggested, that people should be entitled to shoot to kill.  That is not what we advocate.  Fine Gael advocates that we balance the rights of innocence people — victims in their homes — with the rights that already pertain to intruders in the home, and that is important to point out.Both the criminal law and the civil law are confusing in this area.  We hope and strive to achieve a degree of clarity.  We have already pointed out that there is a constitutional issue.  The Constitution has not been done justice via legislation.  The Constitution refers, in Article 40.5, to the inviolability of the dwelling but that has not been transposed into legislation which protects that constitutional right.The following question arises.  Who has rights, victims or perpetrators?  The Constitution provides protections to people in a range of circumstances and the focus is often on the rights of the accused — the rights of those who have been arrested such as the right to fair trial — but we should not forget that it is not just criminals who have rights.  The Constitution bestows rights on all of us, particularly law-abiding citizens, and protects all of us.  It is the duty of the Legislature, and particularly the Government, to ensure that the most basic right, the right to sleep soundly at night in our own homes, is protected.  That is a matter on which the Government, and particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, needs to focus and reflect.In criminal law, for example, the presumption of reasonableness currently lies with the perpetrator and we in Fine Gael consider this unfair.  We propose, in section 3 of the Bill:Where the occupier of a dwelling uses force in relation to a trespasser who is unlawfully present, and remains within the dwelling, the force used by the occupier shall, unless the contrary is proven, be presumed to have been reasonable.We are not proposing a shoot-to-kill Bill.  What we are proposing is simply to shift the burden of proof from the innocence party to the guilty perpetrator, the person who is uninvited and intruding in somebody's home.

The Minister is waiting for a Law Reform Commission report, which has been promised for a long time.  He is planning on fobbing off essential and urgent legislation yet again for a Law Reform Commission report.  We all are well aware that the Law Reform Commission has published many volumes of reports, none of which have ever been acted on.  It is essential to point out as well that the Minister proposes to abolish the Law Reform Commission, and that needs to be put on the record.  There is a little inconsistency in a Government paralysed and unable to act without a report from a body that it proposes to abolish in the first place.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I am pleased to be able to speak on this Bill.  I commend Fine Gael for putting it to the House and commend the discussion and the contributions of all Members of both sides.Deputy Doyle made the point that there was an increase in crime in Wicklow.  It is something that has been seen in certain places and it may be attributable to the difficult budgetary situation and the condition of the economy.  However, we also must be careful, as Deputy Creighton stated, in not over-egging the pudding to try to persuade on the points we wish to make.  We can create a fear of crime.  We can create a situation where people are more in fear of crime than is necessary by using words that are intemperate and designed to achieve a political end rather than to inform or enlighten any debate.  Unintentionally, one can create a spiral of fear and one can feed into this creation of the fear of crime.  There is crime and there are figures for crime.  The figures can increase from time to time but that does not mean that the fear of crime must increase.  Among all of the western European countries, the rate of crime in Ireland is very low and yet there is a political incentive from time to time for political parties to show that they can out-muscle each other on the "hang ‘em and flog 'em, throw away the key" kind of speeches that we have heard on occasion.There is a balance between victims and perpetrators that is reflected in law.  That is a fact of which we all are aware.  I dare say some of the speeches tend to suggest it is an either-or situation.  That is not the case.  There is a fair balance in law and in the Constitution in respect of victims and perpetrators, and that is right and proper.Deputy Creighton referred to the inviolability of the home, which is a right in the Constitution but which is not an absolute right.  There are no absolute rights in the Constitution.  All of these are conditional on other rights and the courts are continuously trying to balance the hierarchy of rights.  It is not accurate to state we must either support the victims or the perpetrators.  We can fashion a law in a civilised society and a criminal justice system that protects both.Much comment has been made about the Law Reform Commission.  The Law Reform Commission has an important role but because we are going to hear what it has to say does not mean that this debate is not relevant, it is very relevant.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill in the last Dáil which preceded a later Law Reform Commission report on the same subject.  The commission referred to the debate on my Bill, and the Bill itself, in formulating its proposals and statutory framework, and that has since passed Second Reading in the House.  It underlines the fact that one can have a useful and informative Private Members' discussion on a Bill followed by a Law Reform Commission report, followed by action in law, and that is what we did on spent convictions.  No doubt the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is genuine in stating that he proposes to make changes when he has had a report from the commission.As has been said, the importance and special status of a person's home is unquestionable.  For example, there is a recognition of this in the Constitution as referred to.  Equally, it is clear that there is a concern in some quarters as to whether the legislation in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 strikes the right balance in terms of the matter to which I have been referring.  The issue has been raised by some Deputies that while in general it legislates adequately for circumstances where self-defence may be applied, it does not deal adequately with such a situation within the home.  As all Members will be aware, the 1997 Act provides that reasonable force may be used to protect oneself or a family member or another, or to prevent a crime.  The key factor is that the use of force must be reasonable in all the circumstances.Another factor that has arisen in the debate is that section of that Act provides that the fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account in all the circumstances is not an absolute duty to retreat — that must be made clear in a reasoned debate on this issue — in determining whether the use of force is reasonable.  That is a matter of law and it is something for a judge to inform a jury on.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the proposed Bill and I want to commend Deputies Michael Ring and Charles Flanagan on bringing it before the House today.  It is timely legislation for many people throughout the country.It is quite clear to the public at large that the rights of the home owner are not being adequately protected.  We need to ensure that the victim has greater support than he or she has under the law at present.  In particular I want to highlight for the Minister the reality of what is happening in the country today and I am worried about what he said in his opening statement.  Deputies and the public at large are aware of cases where persons have entered a property without adequate excuse, with criminal intent, with the result of injury or death.  Such cases have fuelled the debate as to whether the law strikes the correct balance between the rights of the occupier and those of the trespasser.  That is why Deputies Ring and Flanagan have introduced this legislation.  It is quite clear to many that the home or property owner does not have the same rights under the law as the trespasser in such cases.I want to draw the Minister's attention to what is happening, particularly in the west of Ireland, in rural areas, especially in east Galway, the place I know best.  Over the past 12 to 18 months in particular, gangs of raiders have concentrated in east Galway, as the evidence shows.  It is not a question of their concentrating in just isolated areas, but rather in urban neighbourhoods and rural villages, in regions such as Loughrea, Killimer, Portumna, Tynagh and Woodford.  There have been repeated hits on this area and these are occurring with far greater frequency than in the past.  This is giving rise to great concern among communities.  It is difficult to understand why the Government, which is aware of those facts, has decided to curtail the grant assistance for the provision of safety and security, such as alarms for the elderly.  It is unbelievable that the Government can come forward with this idea at the present time.These raiders and gangs have attacked people, damaged their property and stolen vast amounts of items, obviously for resale.  The authorities must realise that these gangs have local information provided by people with links to them.  Reportedly, such local informers are on the payroll of the gangs and successfully identify the property of elderly vulnerable people or business people who may hold valuable items including cash in their houses.  They are paid according to what the raids yield.  Again, it is unbelievable that the present Garda structure in rural Ireland, particularly in east Galway, clearly shows that so-called community policing has left vast areas without cover, as has been repeatedly highlighted this evening for the Minister.The gardaí know that these gangs use special means of communications, for instance traffic cones that are placed outside a house that is deemed suitable for a hit.  Even more commonly, empty plastic bags are used to mark a property.  These are very simple mechanisms, but that is what is going on and if the Minister continues to ignore these occurrences, elderly people in Ireland will be in a vulnerable state.  I ask the Minister to immediately accept the Bill before the House.  If he has to amend it, by all means let him do so, but to reject it out of hand as he has done is a careless response to an absolute need for the protection of people in rural Ireland.

He and the legal staff within Fine Gael thought about the Bill very carefully.  It will not be long before there is a change of government and I have no doubt when this man is Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he will bring the necessary legislation through the House.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I am disappointed with the Minister of State and the Government that they did not accept this Bill.  If there were elements they did not like, these could have been dealt with on Committee Stage.  That has happened in the House before.  Deputies Flanagan and Shatter have brought Bills before the House and previous Governments have brought in the necessary amendments on Committee Stage to deal with them.  I cannot understand why the Government did not do this.  Everybody is crying out for this legislation.  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations and of course the McCarthy report recommended the abolition of the commission, so how will it do its job if this is implemented?  It is important that we have the Law Reform Commission to make recommendations.  The courts are telling us we need to change the law and bring in legislation that protects the home owner.We have had a fair share of difficulties with robbers and burglars in my constituency and seen some of our citizens tied up in their homes and murdered.  We have had other high profile cases in the constituency where people were afraid in their own homes.  There is nothing worse than to live in fear in one's own home.  Mine is the third biggest county in Ireland with many rural areas.  We have these travelling gangs, as Deputy Burke has said, coming through our constituencies, driving through the night, robbing and beating up the elderly and people living in isolated areas.  Admittedly, people do not want to take the law into their own hands.  Neither Deputy Flanagan nor I is saying people should shoot on sight.  We thought about this Bill.  We are not saying that somebody should be shot if one sees him or her in one's garden.  Quite simply we are arguing that if somebody attacks a husband or wife, daughter, son or one's goods, one has a right to save one's family and property.  In the event, when this happens the law is on the side of the perpetrator.I came across a case recently where a guy who was robbing a house fell and broke his ankle and he wanted to sue the occupier.  That is the type of legislation we want to change, to bring the power to the people that are in their homes.  I am not suggesting that the Minister of State should be shot if he comes knocking at my door at 10 o'clock at night.  I know there are those who might want to shoot many Fianna Fáil people, but I am not one of them.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	158	However, I am saying that reasonable force should be allowed.  If some of these cases go to court, I am sure the judge might have an opinion on that, too, but we will not go into that today.  I want to put on the record of the House the fact that I believe that a person's home is his or her castle and he or she has a right to protect it.  A criminal can come in and use whatever power he or she wants.  Criminals are not afraid to use knives, guns and other forms of violent attack.  One has to step back and decide whether to defend one's home, family or one's goods.  The legislation has to be changed.  The power must lie with the home owner.  At present an intruder can come into a person's home and the person must step back and then if the person uses force he or she must go to the court to defend him or herself — perhaps at his or her own cost.  What happens to the criminals?  They get free legal aid from the taxpayer.  The full power of the law is with them.People have had enough of this.  They are sick and tired of what is going on.  This party believes in law and order.  We believe the law and order must come together.  In this case the order must be that a person in his own home must be able to protect his wife, family and goods.  Order must be that if an intruder breaks into a house at 1 a.m., he is not coming in for a cup of tea — he is coming in to rob the house.  If the householder gets in his way he will deal with that person or his or her family.  We have recently seen cases of bank employees being taken from their homes and money being taken.  People must be able to use reasonable force to protect themselves and their families.I cannot understand why the Government has not dealt with this issue before now.  While Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is not in the House at present he will be shortly.  When he brought a similar Bill before the House, we were advised that the Government was to introduce its own legislation.  This week we thought that the Government would accept our Bill.  It was small-mindedness on the part of the Minister and Department not to accept the Bill and make the necessary changes on Committee Stage.Deputy Charles Flanagan has put considerable effort and thought into the Bill.  We did not do this lightly.  We got plenty of legal advice as we wanted to get it right.  If we got parts of it wrong we were prepared to accept whatever amendments the Government wanted to table.  However, it has rejected it again.  The law will be against the people in their homes tonight and the law is with the criminal.  I do not say that I want to see every intruder shot.  However, I am saying that people in their homes should be allowed to use reasonable force against thugs who are prepared to use force against them.  A man in Charlestown was tied up and left to die.  Other old people elsewhere have been beaten up badly.  Problem gangs are going around the country, but they are not as accountable as are those living in their homes.  Sometimes we have names and addresses for them.This is reasonable legislation.  Shame on the Government for not accepting it.  Even at this late stage I call on the Government to accept the Bill, which is good.  If amendments need to be made on Committee Stage, that can be done.  Law should be for the people and not for the criminal.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I wish to refer to two matters, in particular, first, the capital requirements of AIB and Bank of Ireland and the new form Central Bank regulation will take and, second, the unwinding of the NAMA intervention and the macro-economic consequences of NAMA.In the supplementary information document, the green book, it is indicated that AIB has stated in its accounts that it has a provision for impairment on property and construction loans of €2.2 billion.  On the basis of NAMA purchasing loans of €24 billion from AIB, and, as the Minister stated, a possible 30% discount or impairment provision, an amount of €7.2 billion would be more appropriate for the provision rather than €2.2 billion.  Effectively, there is a €5 billion shortfall in the provision in the accounts as presented in the supplementary information document.  That €5 billion shortfall will also impact on core tier 1 capital.The Bank of Ireland today suggested the discount would be closer to 24% rather than30%.  On the basis of what the Minister for Finance stated yesterday, on loans totalling €16 billion, the shortfall in the provision is of the order of €3 billion.  There is a need for core tier 1 capital in terms of either senior debt or equity or both.  The Minister has stated there is a preference for private investment to shore up the difference, on which I agree with him.  If the bank is a commercial entity and in private hands, it will operate better on the international stage and be better able to finance the amount of money it needs to be able to continue to operate effectively.With the increase in the banks' share prices overnight, there is the possibility of a rights issue to enable existing shareholders to have an opportunity to invest in the banks.  I understand the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has indicated an interest in investing in one of the banks.  I would welcome an external private institution investing in the banks to strengthen and bolster their balance sheets, as this is needed.  However, if a private investor does not come forward and there is not an offer of a rights issue, I would envisage the State intervening.  Currently, it has an option on 25% of the shares.  Another significant fraction of the shares should be taken up, with any warrants they may issue, on which a high coupon should be demanded.  I would prefer if the State level of participation remained less than 50% on the basis that it appears from international commentary that a bank that is state controlled tends to have less of an option on the international stage in getting other types of senior debt onto its books.The question arises as to who is responsible for ensuring this core tier 1 capital is put in place.  I congratulate and wish Professor Patrick Honohan well in his job as the Governor of the Central Bank.  I have great admiration for him.  It is a tough job he has taken on, particularly in the circumstances that apply.The DIRT inquiry took place almost ten years ago and I was a member of the committee.  At the time we questioned Central Bank personnel and the associated banks about the cosy arrangement between one and the other.  I vividly remember a person I questioned taking umbrage at the thought that there might be a cosy arrangement between these organisations.  It turned out to be a pretty good television moment.  That was part of the reason in the period immediately after that people took more seriously the questions they were being asked and the tune of the people responsible in the Central Bank and the associated banks changed dramatically at that stage.We have now the question of this new core tier one money that is needed.  I expect that Professor Honohan will insist that timely action is taken by the banks to attain that level.  It is his responsibility and I expect he will complete that task speedily.There is also a need to set out a code of lending.  The Taoiseach stated today that a statutory code of lending would be put in place not only for the SMEs and corporate lending, but also for mortgages.  There is a need to put codes in place for consumer lending and property and commercial lending.  We cannot have a system again whereby 100% loans can be given on property to first-time borrowers, especially at a time when interest rates are so low that such people will be caught in a terrible squeeze as soon as interest rates go up.The Canadian banking system came out pretty well from the turmoil that was created, in particular by the Lehman's situation.  To a great extent there was a large down payment and the loan to value ratio was at approximately 75% or lower.  In hindsight, which gives 20:20 vision, it was crazy to have a loan to value ratio of 100% or higher.The establishment of a central banking commission has been proposed.  I hope we will never again be in a position where we question that commission in terms of any cosy arrangement between it and the banks.  I hope it will take a fully independent stance and act above anyone's business interests and politics and only in the interests of the country.The second matter to which I wish to refer is the unwinding of NAMA.  This is the redemption of the bonds to be issued by the Government.  I would like that done in a manner that will give rise to little or no economic perturbation in the course of the unwinding.  That will take a number of years.  The Minister has stated that it will take up to ten years, and I agree.  I was looking at a report from the International Monetary Fund recently, dated 31 July this year, which includes a graph suggesting that it will take ten years.  More than half of the disposals will be in the years eight to ten.  We are looking at a very slow build up of the unwinding of the NAMA loans over a lengthy period of time.  That is to ensure that it does not in any way disturb the prevailing economic conditions and that there is no spike in the economy as a result of that unwinding.The other interventions by the Government in the banking sector include the guarantee, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It would be expected that those interventions would be unwound earlier than NAMA.  In regard to the guarantees it was suggested that it would happen in September 2010 but I understand now that additional years have been added.  I am not sure of the details but I expect that it will be between five and seven years in total.I am delighted the Bank of Ireland has raised funds which do not come under the scope of the guarantee, as the Minister announced yesterday.  That means the Bank of Ireland will be paying fewer fees to the Government for that guarantee and the other banks involved in the guarantee will over a period try to get the debt they borrowed out from under the guarantee so that the amount of fees that are paid are minimised.  As far as the Government is concerned, while we are grateful for the fees that arise on account of the guarantee, we would like to see that get down to zero as quickly as possible.I would like the Minister to set out the likely phase out programme of the four major interventions.  I would also like him to set out the projected cost-benefit to the Exchequer of these interventions.  Just as I mentioned the fee in regard to the guarantee, in terms of the recapitalisation we have the 8% coupon on the warrants and, as I mentioned last night, if the options were converted from preference shares to ordinary equity, even at this point in time on the basis of the market capitalisation at 5.30 p.m. yesterday I reckoned that approximately €1.3 billion would be made on the €7 billion that was put in, but that would have increased by another €0.5 billion overnight because of the increase in shares.  There is significant potential gain to the Exchequer from the recapitalisation scheme.  We are just wondering when that will happen.It is incumbent on the Minister to give some indication to the public on his intentions regarding Anglo Irish Bank and whether it will remain forever as a nationalised bank or if it is the Government's intention to turn it into a good bank again and sell it off on the market.  It is important that those interventions and the results of them are set out.I acknowledge that the phase out will depend very much on the economic recovery progress in the years ahead also, in so far as when a phase out takes place will depend on how far advanced we are in the recovery process.  People wish to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  It would also help people to manage their expectations and perhaps change their mood from pessimism to optimism, from a savings mode to a spending mode, with the result of bringing forward economic recovery and creating jobs.  It is important to set out the final plan to show that the Government is giving leadership.  Economic circumstances will change and when they do, the basis on which the plan is predicated will change.  The people are aware of that.  A revised plan based on the changing circumstances should be then produced as soon as possible.  It is important to set out the longer term macroeconomic situation in regard to those interventions based on the best estimate of the economic recovery over the timescale of the plan.  That would redevelop trust in the Government.  That is something the Government needs and is due.I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, and all of the other people who have worked so diligently and put in so much time, effort and hours into producing a formula that will return the banking system to a situation whereby it will have a credit mechanism in place so that it will be able to develop and lend money and thus fix the banking system.  With all of the interventions to date, the banking system is now fixed.  We have to get on with the public finances, the Lisbon treaty and the other matters to ensure that this country is back on an even keel and is growing at a reasonable rate in the not too distant future.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	162	People are annoyed about how we got to where we are.  Many are saying the banks and developers got us into this trouble but at the end of the day the problem arose following a change in Government policy in 2004 arising from a report drawn up by the eminent senior counsel former Minister Michael McDowell and implemented by former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, which split the Central Bank and Financial Regulatory Authority of Ireland and did not put in place the type of regulatory regime required to ensure the practices followed in the banks were not allowed to obtain.  It seems the Governor of the Central Bank stood idly by while much of this was happening.  While he might have stated his concerns about our over-dependence on property in the context of what was being borrowed from banks, he put it in very small print and it was largely ignored.The difficulty we have with the National Asset Management Agency is that it is secretive, totally tax-funded and a politically directed work-out process for 1,500 of the most powerful, well connected business people in the country.  Deputy Ardagh and other members involved in the DIRT inquiry know from experience of the dangers in this regard based on evidence given at that inquiry by financial institutions.  They do not always tell the truth, as members of the inquiry found out on that occasion.  While much wrongdoing in the financial institutions was exposed at the time, regrettably, not much was learned from it.  In other words, a property regulatory system was not put in place to ensure the same did not happen again.Not only will taxpayers be scalped by this proposal brought forward by the Government on behalf of developers whom NAMA will deliberately overpay in respect of toxic loans, they will also be in danger of being scalped a second time by developers.  Secrecy in the use of taxpayers' money is at the very heart of NAMA.  Under the Bill the public can be prevented from knowing the names of the developers whose loans will be bought by NAMA with taxpayers' money, the price paid by the taxpayer for these loans, the original value of the loans, lands purchased and amount invested by developers in such deals, the actions taken by NAMA to recover the loans now owned by the taxpayer, the names of those who will benefit from the €5 billion in new tax-funded loans that NAMA will make available to developers to complete their projects and the terms and conditions of loans issued by NAMA to developers and whether these loans will be being given on a commercial or subsidised basis.This presents the alarming possibility that NAMA will, for example, use taxpayers' money to buy a €200 million non-performing developer loan from a bank and lend a further €100 million to the that developer to fund completion of the development, and the public will never know.  Not alone will the absence of disclosure and transparency provisions leave the taxpayer ignorant about what is going on and vulnerable but the legislation also provides extraordinary powers in terms of political interference at every stage of the process, including hiring and firing, asset valuation and the rules of engagement with defunct developers.  This is a frightening formula for sweetheart deals, crony capitalism and taxpayer losses on a massive scale in the next decade at the very time we need to restore our international reputation and use every euro to protect public services and the fairness and competitiveness of our tax system.The Government likes to cite Sweden as an example of where a NAMA-type bank rescue worked.  If there is one thing we have learned about our political system and civic institutions in the last decade, it is that Ireland is not Sweden.  In countries with political institutions more vulnerable to business lobbying this approach does not have a proven track record.  Only last November the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the world's repository of expertise in financial crises, completed a study of banking and property busts in seven other countries where the NAMA approach was adopted.  It concluded that "Government-owned asset management companies appear largely ineffective in resolving distressed assets, largely due to political and legal constraints" and that "the use of asset management companies is positively correlated with peak non-performing loans and fiscal costs".  In layman's terms, the IMF believes NAMA-type bank rescues can end up costing taxpayers an arm and a leg because politically directed state quangos are much less skilled than private bankers at recovering loans from rich, powerful and well connected borrowers.The example that stands out is France where in the 1990s a NAMA-type asset management company lost a total of €18 billion of €28 billion worth of assets purchased by the taxpayer from Credit Lyonnais.  The advantage of Fine Gael's wholesale good bank solution which, significantly, the French have adopted after their disastrous experience with their own NAMA in the 1990s is that the risks and responsibilities associated with working out distressed developer-related loans would remain with those professional bankers and investors who funded the loans and would be best placed to recover them.  I have always believed the only person who can sort one out when in financial difficulty is one's own bank manager because it is he or she who knows all about one in terms of guarantees and income and the lies one told in the past.  Private investors would employ the best skills and judgment to recover as much of the money as possible and there would be no public disquiet about a soft touch approach for the well connected developers.  The only responsibility of the State should be to ensure we have a well capitalised, functioning banking system that delivers credit to struggling businesses and households.  I firmly believe the NAMA solution will not do this.People have lost trust in the Government and require greater reassurance and transparency if NAMA is to work.  Politicians should not be involved in any aspect of this work, particularly not, valuations.  I agree with Deputy Sean Fleming who raised concerns in this regard.  It is hoped his soundings on the matter will not fall on deaf ears on Committee Stage.The Minister's numbers in the context of the Bill amount to a financial fairytale.  He claims that the value of the assets transferred to NAMA will have only to rise by a modest 10% during the next ten years for NAMA to break even.  Presumably, this is based on the simple calculation that guaranteed upfront payments to NAMA — long-term economic value less subordinated debt — will be €51.3 billion or 10% more than the official estimate of current market prices at €47 billion.  While this sounds highly reassuring, a couple of difficulties arise.  We have no idea of where the Minister got his estimate of €47 billion.  A number of people believe this to be optimistic in terms of current market value.  Some €56 billion worth of the underlying assets are land and development projects located, in the main, in Ireland where values have tumbled by between 70% and 95%.  Even finished commercial office buildings here and in the United Kingdom have seen their values tumble by 50%.  One must question the basis for the 47% write-down in the value of underlying assets that underpins the Minister's assumptions.The Government's assertion that prices have hit a trough and are soon to rise is based on the high commercial yields in the Dublin office rental market.  The fact that these yields are likely to fall because of falling rents seems to have escaped the Minister and his advisers.  He expects NAMA will pay its way, wash its face and pay interest on the basis of an initial introductory offer of 1.5%.  However, the fine print shows he will be paying interest of 5% after the first year, leaving a €12 billion black hole in his figures.  This implies that the funding costs of NAMA, assuming current market value is correct — independent commentators are suggesting it could be nearer €38 billion — require a 75% increase, rather than the 10% suggested by the Minister, in prices during the next ten years.I would like at this point to speak about the speech made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  It was the speech of a party leader who has failed to deliver.  The Green Party promised risk sharing with the banks.  According to the chairman of the Green Party, Senator Boyle, they expected risk sharing on a 50-50 basis but they only got a figure of 5%.  The banks have hoodwinked the Government and Fianna Fáil has hoodwinked the Green Party.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, claimed virginity in relation to financial markets.  Let me explain.  If share prices rocket to the extent that they rocketed in the case of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland today, one can be assured the deal obtained by the banks is better than the markets had anticipated.  In a sure sign of delivery failure, his speech is all about what he hopes to do next rather than what he has done in the past two and a half years.  He once more flies the kite of planning change, but when will those changes be implemented?  What is the reason for the delay in bringing such legislation to the House in the past two and a half years?The Minister promises systemic changes in a culture of greed and stupidity.  Yet the legislation he is supporting has at its heart the reinforcement of the culture that got us to where we are today.  The bankers, developers and politicians will remain joined together in the same toxic triangle described by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, this morning.  The bottom line is that the ultimate arbiter of valuations will be the Minister for Finance.  After outlining his wish list for legislative and planning change, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said he will push for further amendments to the NAMA legislation.  I understood this had all been sorted out at the Cabinet meeting last Wednesday after which the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, claimed they had secured significant changes.However, after getting it in the neck from their members in Athlone last Saturday, they were obliged to announce that more changes were required.  In the past week, the Green Party has gone to extraordinary lengths to spin its involvement with this legislation and push its influence.  After the euphoria of last Wednesday evening, it was back to brass tacks when members gave their views.  We must depend on Green Party members at their conference on 10 October to tell their parliamentary party masters, who have become more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil itself, what is good for the country and what is in keeping with the spirt of Green Party policy over many years.The bottom line for Fine Gael is that we are not convinced, for the reasons I have outlined, that this proposition will succeed in getting credit flowing to businesses, thereby retaining and creating employment.  We must look to others to devise a more transparent and less politically driven vehicle than NAMA to get us out of the current difficulties.  People are struggling to come to terms with the sum of €54 billion.  This is the price of the enormous mistakes that were made as a consequence of lack of regulation of financial institutions.  Those involved were allowed to do what they liked, becoming intoxicated with property development as if there would never again be a poor day.A perfect example of this type of activity is what went on at the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, which was apparently run like a downtown branch office of Anglo Irish Bank.  Developers and board members colluded with each other to bring down an essential social regeneration project in an area badly in need of such rehabilitation.  Who now will pay for that regeneration?  Professor Niamh Brennan has said she must wait for a NAMA-type methodology to be introduced before she can obtain a valuation on the sites managed by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, particularly the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.  The authority invested in projects in which it had no reason to invest, including participating in major property speculation in Ringsend, and now it is the taxpayers who must bail it out.  That is the type of decision-making that has brought us to the brink of economic disaster.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his colleagues should concentrate their efforts on cleaning up that mess.

It references a statement by Groucho Marx which sums up rather well what the Government is doing with this legislation: "Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies."  I hope NAMA does not prove to be the wrong remedy.The book to which I referred sets out how the property market was allowed to become dangerously overinflated.  Bankers fuelled this bubble by throwing out the rule book on lending.  As Deputy Hogan said, decisions by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, and other cavalier politicians led to the near invisible financial regulation and reckless tax breaks that made it all possible.  This is summed up clearly in the book and I recommend it to the Tánaiste.There have been consequences to the delay in introducing this legislation.  It has afforded some of those most exposed by this legislation ample time to cover their tracks.  Rather than pursuing some of these so-called zombie developers, the banks merely rolled up the interest.  This will allow them to seek a greater payment from NAMA to reflect the apparent higher value of their assets.  This lack of urgency indicates how the process thus far has been handled poorly by the Government.We are told that the primary objective of NAMA is to ensure that the banks resume lending to businesses and individuals.  I urge a note of caution in this regard.  The banks will try to reduce their loan-to-deposit ratio, which is currently at some €1.65 for the Bank of Ireland, to a prudent €1 lent for every €1 deposited.  In other words, there is no expectation the banks will be in a mood to lend very generously in the times ahead.  The commercial managers who made the decisions in the past to lend money are the same people who are making the lending decisions now.  Having been burned once and subjected to fierce criticism, they will be inclined towards caution.  Although the banks will receive €54 billion through NAMA, this does not guarantee there will be lending on the same scale as heretofore and that every small business will be saved.  It is important to recognise that.The banks will not in future be willing to participate in the types of competitive practice  that featured in the past.  Some of the more responsible banks were essentially forced into a position of reckless lending by the reality that a potential customer who was refused credit in their institutions could simply go directly to Anglo Irish Bank to secure it.  Any such loss of custom would be seen as a failure.  As a result, all banks were effectively in competition with Anglo Irish Bank.  It  is important to bear in mind that the issue of liquidity, as described by Dermot Desmond in an excellent article in one of yesterday's newspapers, may not be resolved by this provision.Looking to a recent international example, the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States was established in the aftermath of the savings and loans crash in the late 1980s.  This body proved to be a loss-maker in the long run.Will NAMA be subject to the Freedom of Information Act?  Will a regulator or ombudsman be established to deal directly with NAMA and allow arbitration to take place outside the courts system?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this most important legislation.  Some commentators have described this Bill as perhaps the most important legislation to have come before the House in a generation.  There is no doubt that we must get it right, not for our own sake, as legislators, but for the sake of our economy, the enterprises that are the engine of the economy and the workers and families and indeed all citizens whose standard of living is so closely linked to Ireland's economic health.My focus is on how this Bill contributes to economic recovery in support of enterprise.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his address to the House yesterday, set out in detail on behalf of the Government the main provisions of the Bill.  I do not propose to repeat what the Minister said but as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I will set out what I see as the key rationale for this Bill and the reasons it must be supported.Sustaining and developing enterprise and jobs remains at the top of my agenda and that of the Government.  That is the starting point for all our efforts.  Since 2000, Ireland has been losing ground in terms of international competitiveness.  The recent economic contraction has brought real challenges — national income is declining rapidly and unemployment is rising sharply.  However, there has been a modest improvement in cost competitiveness.  Export-led growth is a key part of any sustainable longer-term strategy to maintain living standards and secure long-term prosperity.  This will require a substantial further improvement in our international competitiveness.  This will mean bringing our cost base into line with market reality and building our skills base, infrastructure, technology and ability to operate as a smart, open, trading economy in an increasingly complex world.  The National Asset Management Agency has a key role to play in this by addressing the reality that unless problem assets on the banks' loan books are dealt with and are seen to be dealt with, banks will be unable to attract resources to resume sensible lending to enterprise.The people running our small and medium size enterprises need no reminding of the scale of the unprecedented challenges facing the business community.  The severity of the international financial crisis and our particular exposure to it is well known.  International and domestic demand and investment has suffered.  Over the past year, exporting businesses have been particularly badly hit by the fall in the value of sterling against the euro.  These are the toughest of times for Irish businesses.The Government has taken action on a number of fronts to address these issues.  It has provided €100 million for an enterprise stabilisation fund, under which Enterprise Ireland may give up to €500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.  The Government has also introduced arrangements to reduce the payment period by Government Departments to business from 30 to 15 days.  Last month, I announced a €250 million scheme to protect up to 27,400 vulnerable jobs in the productive sector of the economy.  The temporary employment subsidy scheme will provide a subsidy of €9,100 per employee over 15 months to qualifying exporting enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.Another issue, namely, access to and the cost of finance, is critical for Irish businesses, particularly indigenous firms which cannot easily access credit on international financial markets.  There are real concerns that the turmoil in global financial markets and exposure of Irish banks to bad loans is affecting Irish firms in terms of their ease of access to finance and its cost.  It is essential that viable businesses, particularly small and growing businesses, are not hampered by reduced access to credit.  Our businesses need credit to be available in order that they can invest in their people and equipment, source supplies, grow to scale, invest in marketing and promotion as well as to help fund the supply of goods and services that input into their products.  They also need credit to be available to their customers in order that they can purchase those products.  If we want this period of contraction to be quickly succeeded by an upturn, this is the normality to which we must return.  I share the view of the International Monetary Fund that delays in fully relieving the banks of their impaired assets will delay a return to normal functioning.The issue of access to credit for small and medium enterprises has been raised repeatedly at recent meetings with business representative organisations, such as the Small Firms Association, ISME and Chambers Ireland.  The messages emerging from the available data certainly add to the concern.  We have seen negative growth in private sector credit in almost all sectors.  The volume of new business loans and overdrafts to non-financial corporations is down.  Total lending to the small and medium size sector has remained relatively static.  Bank reports to the Financial Regulator show that while new business lending is taking place, it is at a lower rate than last year.  In terms of the cost of credit, average retail margins for most lines of credit have been above the euro area average.The Government has taken action in advance of the establishment of NAMA.  The bank recapitalisation package of February last contain a commitment from the recapitalised banks to increase their lending capacity to small and medium-size enterprises by 10% in 2009.  Small and medium size enterprises are now covered by the code of conduct on business lending, which will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of the small and medium enterprise sector by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will provide funding for small and medium-size enterprises on foot of the €300 million facility provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing small and medium size enterprises.  Last May, the Minister for Finance and I established a credit supply clearing group with bank, business and State representation.  This group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.We have published the Review of Bank Lending to SMEs, the Mazars report, which examined credit availability and recommended appropriate action.  Follow-up work on implementing the recommendations in the Mazars report is ongoing through the work of the credit supply clearing group.  To assist and complement the work of the group, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, held eight regional meetings over a two week period during June and July to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the State sector their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level.  All these initiatives will help ensure that viable Irish enterprises have available to them the credit required to protect and grow their businesses.We must, however, address one other fundamental problem.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has stated, concern about the impact of risky loans on the banking system continues to create funding difficulties for the banks and restrict the flow of credit.  Every euro lent by a bank to a customer or an enterprise must be drawn from deposits or borrowed from somewhere else.  Irish banks rely heavily on financial institutions abroad for funding.  Uncertainty surrounding the scale of losses on the banks' balance sheets has made this funding more difficult and costly to attract.  Added to this, uncertainty about the losses for the banks that will result from these loans leads to nervousness about adequacy of their capital.  This can result in banks not providing the credit to enterprise that is necessary to support economic recovery.The agency proposed in the Bill will lead to smaller, cleaner and better funded banks which can focus on their core, profit generating business, lending to the productive economy at a margin appropriate for the risk involved.  NAMA will do this by buying the land and development property loans and certain associated loans from the banks at prices well under the current book value.  These loans will then be managed by NAMA over time to achieve the best possible financial return for the taxpayer.  Concern for taxpayers and enterprises is at the heart of the Government's approach.Enterprises must be assured that the banks will be given specific direction as to what is expected of them.  The Minister for Finance made it crystal clear yesterday that the banks should be extremely grateful for the continued support and forbearance extended by citizens and, in return, they are expected to provide appropriately risk adjusted credit to businesses to protect and create jobs.

It is not unexpected that a period of volatility in share prices would follow a significant announcement such as yesterday's and it will be a number of days before its full effects are visible.  While the publication of half-year results at midday today by one institution will have had an impact, the initial increase in share values may be interpreted as an expression of confidence in our ability to take the decisive action necessary to deliver a restructured and cleansed banking system which can support recovery.  While the publication of half-year results at midday today by one institution will have had an impact, the initial increase in share values may be interpreted as an expression of confidence in our ability to take the decisive action necessary to deliver a restructured and cleansed banking system which can support recovery.There is an urgency associated with this legislation.  Economic recovery appears to be emerging in parts of Europe and in the United States.  The UK, Germany, the US and others have established schemes to deal with impaired assets.  These schemes are designed to meet the specific problems each of these countries faces.  First, Ireland must be able, and be seen to be able, to devise and implement approaches to deal with problems affecting our financial and credit system.  Second, we must devise an approach which frees our banks of higher risk loans, so we are in a position to benefit from that economic recovery emerging in the United States and Europe.  Without the functioning banking and credit systems that NAMA is to create, Irish businesses will not be able to grow and develop their products for export to these, our main trading partners.The Government has acted consistently and coherently to address the current financial difficulties and chart our way through current difficulties in order to be ready for the upturn when it comes.  Central to our success is the introduction and passage through the Houses of the NAMA legislation currently before us.  The successful passing of the Lisbon treaty referendum is also critical to cement our central position within the European Union.We must consider and act on the McCarthy report recommendations and those of the Commission on Taxation, so that they feed into the framing of the upcoming budget.  Hard and unpopular decisions will be taken to bring our public finances into better order and pave the way for a return to economic stability.  Successful outcomes of these measures will demand that the Government, businesses, banks, the public and all other stakeholders accept the gravity of our situation and work together to ensure we continue on the road beyond the current crisis and on to recovery.  By working together we can get through the current difficult economic environment.  We have done so in the past and there is no reason we cannot do so again.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Like the Tánaiste, I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to what history will, no doubt, record as being perhaps the most important debate to have occurred in this Chamber for many a long year.  There are those who say this Chamber lacks relevance or that it does not debate issues which impact directly on the lives of ordinary citizens, but this important discussion does not bear out that popular perception.Our recent political history is littered with examples of where we have not faced up to really difficult problems.  We have shied away from them and, more often than not, have taken the easy solution.  This crisis, however, requires an altogether different response.  It requires really decisive action, but more importantly, it requires a workable solution no matter what one's ideological perspective.  It also requires the Government, of whatever composition, to act with real courage and conviction to produce the right results.  Our history also shows us that the most workable solutions to the problems and crises that face this country are often the least popular.  In addition, the most popular solutions are often the least workable, which is the case concerning some of the proposed solutions to the crisis in which we find ourselves.As a relatively young Member of this House, I deeply resent the questioning of my motivation, or of anybody's here, concerning the proposals that have been brought forward.  The innuendo that we are all part of a grand conspiracy or cosy cartel to protect vested interests in this society is, frankly, unworthy of those making the accusations I have heard across the floor of this House. We should be mature enough to engage in a debate about a crisis facing the country without resorting to that level of debate.  We should also recognise that this debate is taking place not just in an Irish context but also in a global one.  Virtually every developed economy is facing a distressed banking situation in one shape of another.  The situation in the United States arose from complex derivatives, while distressed assets in Britain were caused by other factors.  Ireland's particular situation in the banking sector has been caused to a large extent by greed and the failure of the regulatory authorities.As regards the solution, the Government is proposing a number of matters.  If we are to understand the nature and importance of the guarantee which we installed and undertook almost a year ago — which practically every other country in Europe followed to one extent or another — its real effect was a clear national statement that we were not prepared to let the Irish banking system fail.  If we were in any way to weaken our resolve in that important national policy position, it would certainly cause enormous difficulties for our banking system.As regards the Fine Gael proposal, there is a seductive attraction in the idea that maybe we should punish the bankers and let those people who invested in our banks suffer a little more.  However, the implication in the guarantee is that we will protect our banking system.  That will involve difficult and unpopular policy choices, but not to do so would be the ultimate disservice to taxpayers.We share common objectives across the floor of this House.  We want to have a modern, functioning and well regulated banking system that serves the real economy.  The question we must resolve, however, is what solution works.  Three solutions have been proposed.  The Government solution is an asset management agency which seeks to resolve a current crisis in a way that has worked in other jurisdictions.  The Labour Party proposal for nationalisation, blanket or otherwise, has major problems as far as we are concerned.  Fine Gael's so-called good bank — or bad bank, certainly if it does not work — has major flaws.  I wish to address the problems associated with the proposed solution by Fine Gael.  In his speech this morning, the Fine Gael leader, Enda Kenny, pointed to the French financing corporation, the SFEF, as an example of a new and successful wholesale bank, along the lines of what his party is proposing.  Deputy Kenny does not seem to realise that if a similar entity were to be brought into force here it would be completely redundant.  By citing the French example with approval, Fine Gael is effectively trying to piggy-back on a solution which does not address the real issue in the Irish situation, namely, the distressed loans on balance sheets of Irish banks.  The SFEF model simply does not do it and to pretend otherwise is walking away from reality.  Why does it not do so?  The SFEF is effectively a pass-through financing entity between financial markets and the French banks, which was established in 2008.  The SFEF raises funds for the banks by selling government-guaranteed bonds on financial markets, and lending those funds to the banks.  French banks, of course, can issue their own bonds in the normal way, but the difference here is that the French do not have a state-guaranteed scheme like ours, and these bonds are not government guaranteed.  Therefore, the SFEF, which Fine Gael quotes with approval, is merely a mechanism to provide a state guarantee to normal commercial banks' funding.  The funding of Irish financial institutions is currently guaranteed by the State under the scheme introduced last September.  That is the essential difference between the French and Irish situations, and it is why Fine Gael's attempt merely to copy what is a successful model would not solve the Irish problem.  I have not heard one economist saying that it addresses the major distressed assets on the balance sheets of Irish banks.  However, there are other differences between the French model and Fine Gael's proposal.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I would like to hear the Deputy's response to what I am saying in a moment.  Fine Gael's bank would apparently obtain funds from the ECB, while the SFEF raises funds from wholesale markets, not from the ECB.  That is a critical difference between Fine Gael's proposal, which I suggest is a copycat model, and the reality of the French model.  Fine Gael's bank would be also State-owned, whereas the SFEF is 60% owned by the French banks.Deputy Kenny also referred to the majority state-owned bank, Credit Lyonnais.  The French Government set up the bank in 1995 and the Deputy implied that the fact that bank recorded losses suggested NAMA would be wrong.  This is a patently incorrect analysis of the French situation.  At best, it illustrates a deep misunderstanding on the part of the Deputy and, at worst, a shallow attempt to spread fear.  The French bank bought bad assets at a nominal discount with the intention of making losses while clearing up a particular situation.Regardless of whether one agrees with Fine Gael's fundamental statement on national policy, we will stand behind our banking system and bring in a workable model to repair that system while the essential and critical flaw in Fine Gael's policy is it departs from our model and leaves us open to potentially being unable to raise money on the international financial markets.  If it were introduced, AIB and Bank of Ireland would find their ability to raise money would evaporate in the morning.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I would like to raise a number of questions with the Minister for Finance on behalf of business people trying to plan their survival in the real economy.  I would be obliged if the Minister when he replies to the Second Stage debate would address these acute concerns of people who are trying to stay in business and retain their workers in employment.  The debate for the past number of weeks has been dominated by property and, not surprisingly, the valuation of the properties, in whatever stage of development, that underpin the loans being transferred to NAMA, but what about the real economy?The banks have frozen credit.  They may be advertising "business as usual" but all they are doing is advertising.  Small business owners have been hanging on waiting for the Government.  They have been borrowing from relatives; they have not been paying or are delaying paying their creditors; they have been using up their savings; and their overdrafts have been cut back or eliminated.  The banks do not tell the truth.  Whatever the Government was to come up with almost a year after governments in the UK and the US took decisive action, it was hoped it would inject liquidity into the system and normal business could resume.NAMA is the Government's response and, although speaking the language of compromise, the Government has set its face against any other response.  No mechanism in this Bill offers any confidence to SMEs and business generally that the taxpayer-guaranteed ECB funding will ever get to small business.  There is no mechanism and there are no guarantees.  The chronic, if not technically insolvent, condition of our banks together with the impact of the 30% discount makes it probable that the banks will cash in the taxpayer's IOUs to correct their loan-to-deposit ratios.  At all stages since July 2008, the banks have been economical with the truth and, on occasion, downright misleading.  If the 30% discount is applied to the truthful balance sheet realities of the banks, they are most likely to use the ECB funding themselves rather than start lending again in the normal way.The banks will revert to doing what they do.  They will act in the best interests of their shareholders first.  Twelve months ago we were all agreed it was the end of the new banking model and the end of enormous salaries and obscene bonuses.  Let us have a look at what is happening on Wall Street and in the City of London.  President Obama, of whom the Minister for Finance is so enamoured, and Prime Minister Brown have both publicly expressed their bitter frustration and disappointment that the old practices are creeping back.  It was cringe-making to hear the Minister plead with the banks yesterday after the biggest bailout in history.  He stated:The banks should be extremely grateful for the continued support and forbearance extended by the citizens.  In return, the Government expects the banks to play more than their part in the economic recovery of the State by providing appropriately risk adjusted credit to businesses to protect and create jobs.  Our citizens deserve nothing less.The Minister is too clever a man to believe that the banks will pay the slightest attention to his pleading.  As far as being grateful to the citizens goes, what a load of nonsense.  Sean FitzPatrick told RTE he was grateful for the guarantee of 29 September 2008 but he said Anglo Irish Bank was a thriving bank in an over-regulated environment.The two Brians become incandescent if reminded of the organic links between Fianna Fail, developers and the banks.  They can relax because I will not go down that road.  Their only motivation, they say, is to fix the banks and get them lending again but will NAMA do that?  If that is the main purpose — I agree it should be — why are we imposing a mortgage of, according to Deputy Bruton, €34,000 on every family in Ireland unless we are certain that normal lending will resume?The evidence is that the Irish banking model has failed.  The model developed in recent years involving the lending of money based on security.  The traditional banking role of lending money to businesses where a view must be taken on the strength of the business and the acumen of the business people involved essentially no longer exists.  Current bank management and senior staff are not equipped in today's market to lend to businesses on this basis.  The banking system needs a fundamental overhaul and the introduction of experienced businessmen and the reintroduction of traditional banking skills to equip the banks to lend into the real economy in the current Irish economic situation.It is not only SMEs who are sceptical about normal lending being freed up by this Bill.  I refer to the verdict of the financier, Mr. Dermot Desmond.

Regarding this legislation, he stated:Nama as conceived will do untold long-term damage to Ireland Inc. It will result in paralysis for decades to come. Ireland's key focus must be to get the economy moving again and start to promote the real economy. Without this tax revenues will continue at the current low levels and unemployment outside the public sector will continue to grow. Everything must be done to avoid ongoing stagnation.If I had the same antipathy to taking the banks into public ownership as articulated by the Government, I would burn the midnight oil studying Mr. Desmond's proposals for an alternative to NAMA.  Mr. Desmond acknowledges where the blanket guarantee has landed us.  He points out that the shareholders of the banks and their bondholders should suffer the cost of failure.  These bondholders are private institutions, including hedge funds, which took a calculated business risk in subscribing to these bonds.  Why should they not be required to share the cost involved?  I do not believe that forcing these institutions to engage in such a renegotiation of their bonds will cause difficulty to Irish banks raising funds in the future.We cannot further recapitalise the Irish banking sector without first entering into discussions with these bondholders to agree a significant write-down in the amount of moneys owed to them for which they might be compensated in terms of equity if that was considered appropriate.  I am not advocating defaulting and do not want to be construed as advocating it but they should take their share of the pain.  It was a calculated business risk on their part and we should enter negotiations to cause them to write down the moneys owing to them and take their share of the pain.

It was remarkable.  It was picked up very shortly afterwards on these benches by my party leader, Deputy Gilmore, and my colleague Deputy Burton, but we have never had an answer as to why subordinated debt was included.Mr. Desmond's proposals at least contain a built-in incentive to get credit flowing again.  He said:The Government could achieve exactly the same impact by €60 billion of bonds issued by the banks themselves, with the Government underwriting them.  The Government can then charge a completely transparent fee for the use of this guarantee.  This leaves all the risk of the existing loans with the existing capital providers and could be implemented in the morning without quangos, complicated legislation or additional risk.If Mr. Desmond was handling this himself I doubt if he would settle for a transparent fee, but we could deal with that.  The taxpayer would have to get a substantial equity position in return for the substantial risk that they would be taking in guaranteeing this new debt to be issued by the banks.If it is true that Mr. Desmond's input has been with the Department of Finance for a number of months, as Deputy Kenny said this morning, it bears out that once the Government settled on the NAMA approach it would not entertain alternative proposals, contrary to the public protestations of Ministers.  Instead the Minister embraced a proposal from a private consultant with no particular qualifications in banking.  However, he did have experience as a stockbroker and as a director of a development company.The process has legal advice from a company of solicitors which is also advisor to one of the banks and several property developers, and the valuation process will be guided by an advisor whose previous role was selling property to and for developers.  NAMA is a particularly Irish solution.  A Government which says it is opposed to nationalisation establishes a State quango on the advice of a former developer and stockbroker which will be advised on valuation by a man who helped create the bubble and advised by a company of solicitors with so many Chinese walls that their offices should be ringed by rickshaws.Whatever the differences are in the House between the parties, there are some questions to which we need answers.  We need answers on what the plan is for Anglo Irish Bank and who will write the cheque to whom on the interaction between it and NAMA.  Is one wing of the State writing the cheque to the other wing?  How in the name of God was it permitted for a small bank, captured by friends of Fianna Fáil, to grow and grow like Topsy until it threatened the entire banking system?We have never had an explanation——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I will leave that out.I also wish to raise a question under section 218, which concerns the Minister for Finance trying to insert himself between the Comptroller and Auditor General and his reporting to the Committee of Public Accounts or to this House.  I remind him that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional office and I do not understand how the Minister can bring in a provision that permits him to censor the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It is a breach of the constitutional convention and makes the Comptroller and Auditor General an agent of the Executive rather than the Dáil, as the Constitution envisages.I also wish to raise the question of democratic oversight of this proposal.  It is one of the areas in which the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has used his conciliatory skills.  He said he would agree to many things before the debate started.  It is plain he has no intention of agreeing to any of them, but he has the public convinced that if only the Opposition would come into the parlour the problem would be solved and that we have no idea how agreeable a chap he is.  I want to hear the Minister's views on democratic oversight.How did he manage to convince the public that he would support the Honohan amendment?  He did not do anything of the kind, but Patrick Honohan is now Governor of the Central Bank and, as such, is muffled and cannot speak out for himself.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, persuaded the members of the Green Party, who are gullible enough to swallow anything to try and stay where they are, that he would support the Honohan amendment, which has been explained in the House.  Both payments envisaged by the Minister are going to the banks and not the shareholders, which keeps more risk on the balance sheet of the banks than is desirable.Deputy Ardagh referred to the experience of the DIRT inquiry, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator and, ten years later, we do not seem to have learned anything.  Fianna Fáil will say it learned something.  I heard my constituency colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, telling RTE radio about how much he enjoyed the DIRT inquiry when he was on it and all he learned.  He was not within an asses' roar of the DIRT inquiry and never had anything to do with it, but that did not stop him.Whatever the difference between the parties about our respective approaches, there is no doubt, as Deputy Deenihan said earlier, about the momentous character of the decision that has to be made.  No budget that has ever come before the Oireachtas and no economic plan or debate in this House has ever compared in significance to the NAMA initiative, as the Minister of State, Deputy Power, has said.  It is the biggest gamble ever sponsored by an Irish Government.There is enormous risk attached to whatever we do and the comprehensive all-embracing character of the blanket guarantee into which the Government was railroaded on 29 September last means we are already monstrously exposed.  Therefore, there is risk attached to whatever course is taken.  The main issue to which the House must turn its attention is how to minimise the cost to the Exchequer while at the same time ensuring that the banks begin to lend again.It is probably the case that the financial and banking crisis has changed the rules of the game even if we do not yet recognise it.  We have probably reached a juncture that threatens fundamental structural change in politics.  The coping classes have never felt so challenged, bereft of leadership and disillusioned with politics.  Retired people have watched their savings evaporate and their pensions threatened.  Many homeowners are in negative equity and more and more face repossession.  Professionals are losing their livelihoods as never before, certainly not since the 1930s.  Small companies are struggling to stay in business.  Banks are not lending and jobs are being lost.These people have no confidence in this Government.  They do not trust the members of the Government, as they believe Ministers coasted in the good times and are now paralysed in the bad times.  The people have made up their minds.  They agree that the same faces in the Government are directly responsible for the fact that more economic damage has been done to Ireland than to any comparable country.  Our Ministers lived on the back of the hog during the boom times, but they headed for the bunker when the bubble burst.  They were asleep at the wheel.  A small bank was captured and allowed to grow until it threatened our entire banking system.  No one shouted stop.  The economic crisis had taken hold before the Government woke from its slumber.  It has failed to explain the dimensions of the crisis to the people.  It is paralysed by the knowledge that it is directly culpable for the fact that the recession is worse in Ireland then anywhere else.  The rules have changed.  People are looking for leadership and engaging with politics once more.  They want to know there is hope for the future.  They are sick of stroke politics, golden circles and hereditary seats.  They may not yet be persuaded that either or both of the Opposition parties have earned their confidence, but they are certain they want shot of this Government.There is a structural shift taking place in Irish politics.  The old paradigm has broken down.  Fianna Fáil believes that if it can survive the next 100 days and keep its head down thereafter, economic recovery elsewhere in the world will eventually restore its God-given mission to govern.

Similarly, any sensible person will accept that the first myth propagated by some of our opponents — that this country's recession is an entirely Irish creation — is a load of rubbish, given that Ireland exports over 90% of its produce and therefore depends greatly on world markets.  The Government's response to this severe crisis has been sensible, steadfast and mature.  If it had not introduced the bank guarantee scheme on 29 September 2008, there is no doubt that there would have been a run on the banks the following day.  While Fine Gael had the courage to support that scheme, the Labour Party, as usual, flunked it when the heat came on.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 provided for the banks to get some support in the form of a financial injection.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 facilitated certain emergency reductions in public expenditure.  This Bill — the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 — represents the Government's latest response to this crisis.It is fair to say that the Government, through the Oireachtas, has put in place a comprehensive legislative package in response to this serious crisis.  With the exception of Fine Gael when it supported the bank guarantee scheme, the Opposition has been most unhelpful at every stage in this process.  It has been destructive of the national interest.  Opposition Deputies have consistently talked Ireland down, in comments which have been reported by financial media throughout the world.  One has the impression that they are so desperate and hungry for power that they would say anything, even if it damages Ireland, if it increased their chances of getting into power.  I do not think that is how one would describe a responsible Opposition.I do not shirk from saying that the Bill discussion has had to be introduced because the banks and the financial regulators failed their shareholders, their customers and Ireland as a whole.  Opposition Deputies constantly accuse the Government of having embarked on some kind of spending spree during the term of the last Administration and up until this crisis.  They do not seem to remember their own speeches, even though they are freely available on the record of this House.  During the debates on successive budgets, the Opposition berated the Government and the Minister for Finance of the day for not spending more money.  They always wanted more to be spent.  If one examines those budgets, one will find that when the current Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he put the brakes on Government expenditure.  The large capital sum that was built up by successive Governments since the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was available when it was needed to rescue the banks.  Is there anyone in this Chamber who would prefer if we had spent the moneys in the fund several years ago?  One of those who thinks the funds should have been spent on more schools and hospitals, etc., happens to be the finance spokesperson of the Labour Party.

Our education system is the envy of the world.  We have a set of highly talented people, many of whom are unemployed at the moment, unfortunately.  We have the English and Irish languages.  We have a stable society with a well respected legal system.  We have a vastly improved infrastructure.  There are many positive things in Ireland.  If we are to achieve NAMA's primary purpose, which is to restore growth to our economy, we have to take toxic debt from the banks and ensure it is properly managed by a professional agency.It does not suit Opposition Deputies for us to free up the banks to provide money to business, commerce and industry and get employment going again.  They would prefer high unemployment and civil discontent, so they could get up on every trailer to slag off the Government.  Deputies on this side of the House want banks that work and industries that grow.  We want a successful economy and to restore the full employment that existed a mere two and a half years ago.  We believe it is possible to achieve those goals.The Opposition has failed to realise that NAMA has the support of the European Commission and the IMF.  In June 2009, the IMF noted that the policies were right but that determined execution of NAMA and the Government's budget plans were required for recovery.  That is a ringing endorsement of the NAMA project.  I would like Opposition Members to work with the Government to restore our competitiveness and balance the budget but whenever we ask them for concrete plans for savings, they are short on answers.

If Opposition Deputies were willing to engage in proper and meaningful debate, they would acknowledge that fact.  I commend this Bill to the House.

In fairness to the Labour Party, over the past decade it has devoted significant time and effort to examining the problem of housing affordability and has put forward a number of commendable solutions which would have addressed some of the problems we now face if they had been implemented in a timely manner.The problems which NAMA is intended to solve are complex and deserve detailed examination.  The booming Celtic tiger economy contributed significantly by creating an upwards spiral in expectations, wages and house prices.  In the white heat of that period, it was difficult to speak about the need to dampen down house prices.  The demographic changes in the population contributed to price inflation in that an extraordinary bulge of young people reached the stage of home ownership.  Indeed, the boom in birthrates which occurred last year may lead to a similar problem 20 years hence.The ready availability of 100% loans from financial institutions contributed hugely to our difficulties.  Our entry into the eurozone was also a factor.  It is difficult for Ireland to act alone to dampen credit availability but we need to put the genie back into the bottle somehow.I also wish to discuss the hype generated by the property pages of national newspapers.  Property supplements were occasionally as large as the main newspaper.  Some of us drew attention to this extraordinary development but too few saw the writing on the wall.Tax breaks for developers contributed significantly to our current difficulties.  Since they were first introduced in 1985, property-based tax incentives contributed substantially to the rise in property values.  Corruption also played a part.  The extraordinary emphasis on property and land rezoning by the two major parties during the boom years did not lead to significant social gain.We are moving towards a planning Bill which will address the increase in the price of building land by implementing one of the measures recommended in the Kenny report.  This report, which was published in 1973, makes for good reading because even back then there was disquiet over the major increases in the price of land and a strong belief that something had to be done.  It is a reflection on successive Governments that we have had to wait this long before strong action was taken.It is interesting to have a debate on the right price for building land and housing.  Some would seek a return to the boom years of double digit increases, although I am not among them.  Others hope the price of property will fall to half its current value but I am not convinced that would be in Ireland's best interest.  Stability would certainly help, particularly for the younger generation.  We have to find easier ways for young people to access the menu of housing options.  However, we must also be careful not to see home ownership as the be all and end all because that attitude also contributed to house price increases.Green Party members held a fascinating meeting in Athlone last week in which we discussed these issues.  One of the participants at that gathering noted that we were holding our debate in a hotel which is 12 stories high and sits atop a four story basement car park.  In the context of a debate on the planning we want to see in the future, it would be interesting to ask whether that kind of development represents what we want for our medium-sized towns.  One of the results of the boom years was that a town such as Athlone contains a massive oversupply of hotels because of the overzoning carried out in the expectation that the goose would continue to lay golden eggs for generations to come.  We have a few tools with which we can move away from that attitude.  NAMA may well be one of them.  We also must put in place much more rigorous and stronger planning policies, and that is a debate where there is not complete buy-in from all parties in the House.  In the interventions that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has made in the development plans of some counties such as Monaghan and Mayo, I saw consternation from the elected members in those areas who felt that we should be having a considerable amount of land rezoned and should allow housing in most locations.  That is not right.  We must suck the development into the right areas, we must review the national spatial strategy and we must have more concentrated development of a much higher design quality.  That is part of what must be done.We also must put planning more closely at the heart of the NAMA legislation.  There is a reference in the legislation to zoning criteria.  We must move beyond that.  I would like to see the phraseology in the preamble to the 2000 planning Act, which states that it is founded on the principles of proper planning and sustainable development, incorporated into part of the National Asset Management Agency legislation because planning criteria must be at the heart of the various criteria at which the new agency will look.It is also crucial that we have the best international advice.  I get a shiver down my spine when I see many of the agencies that were the poster boys for bad behaviour during the boom years in property sales being mentioned in the context of assisting NAMA in its endeavours.  I would much rather have a dour Dutchman throwing up his hands in despair at the amount of rezoned land under the control of NAMA and telling us we must reduce this than have some of those names that featured on the front of the property pages suggesting to us that the price increases will start again and all will be well.

#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	218	That is correct.There has been some comment, in various radio interviews I have done and elsewhere, that the suggestion has been made on the Government benches that I, in my former capacity as economics editor of RTE, was somehow in favour of the Government's NAMA proposal, and I want to take this opportunity to put the record straight.  In April last when there was an appendix to the budget with a summary of a Government plan on the banks and I was asked what was the story with the plan, I said a plan is better than no plan and that, ultimately, we would have great arguments on the valuations of this and it would not help lending in the short term and possibly in the medium term.  That has been interpreted as some kind of an approval for the Government's approach.I want to make clear that, in terms of what we knew in April last, a great deal of detail was left out.  Up until April last the Government had been running around like a headless chicken with no plan whatsoever since the beginning of the credit crisis, which started in August 2007 and became a disaster and crisis from September 2008.  Any plan sounded like a good idea to the people who were panicking over the chaos which had ensued and a brief outline of a plan was probably welcomed in financial circles, but what has unfolded as the details have been filled in makes clear that what we have in front of us is not a good plan.  It is a nightmare for the taxpayer.  It may be a dream plan for banks but it is something which will leave us, if we pursue it and if we carry on along this route, with untold long-term economic damage.There was no suggestion in April last when this was produced that we would be paying over the odds for these assets.  There was no such thing as this invention of "long-term economic value", whatever that is supposed to mean.  There was no suggestion either that the taxpayer would be taking so much risk.  There was an expectation, surely, that the banks would take many of these losses themselves — nothing like what we have in front of us — and there was no suggestion whatsoever that the plan would not include any commitment to ensure that the banks engage in new lending.  As it contains none of those elements, it is clear that this is not a good plan.  It is something that we should not proceed with at all.If any evidence was required that this is a dream solution for the banks, one need only look at what happened with the stock market reaction where the share prices of banks went through the roof this morning.  Last night the former chief executive of Bank of Ireland, on the television programme, "Tonight with Vincent Browne", stated that those who do not like NAMA should go out today and buy bank shares, and that way they would get part of the coming party.  If anybody wants to know what this plan is about, that answer should suffice.  This is a plan which may well fix up the banks, but it stitches up the taxpayer.  That is for sure.This Government plan is full of holes.  It means that we will borrow €54 billion for an indefinite period and take a significant amount of risk.  We have been told not to worry about the borrowing of that money, that we are borrowing it at a 1.5% interest rate, we should be delighted with the opportunity and that it will be a great assistance to the economy.  I had been wondering for a period, as most people had, exactly how this would work until we heard the Minister for Finance this morning on the radio explaining it.  He stated that NAMA will issue six-month bonds at 0.5% above the European Central Bank rate.  The difficulty is that every six months these bonds must be reissued at 0.5% above whatever is the new relevant ECB rate.  This is a variable rate mortgage, which the Minister is asking us to take out for an indefinite period, for €54 billion.The worse aspect of this mortgage is that it is an interest-only variable rate mortgage.  As these are Government bonds, there is no way we are paying back any of the principal.  This is like a child asking his or her parents to go guarantor for a borrowing of €54 billion, with the child getting an interest-only mortgage at a low interest rate that would go up in time.This is the lowest possible point in the interest rate cycle.  This interest rate will go up.  We have been given no indication of how long this commitment will be for.  We can only assume it will be at least a decade.  The economics of this plan will fall apart as a result.  A 1% increase in the interest rate by the ECB will mean a €540 million additional bill for NAMA.  As those interest rates go up one can be certain that the income from the loans which the Government states are providing some income will go down because the interest rate will go up in line with mainland European economic performance and our economy is bound to lag behind that given Ireland's present position.  Therefore, there is no way that the supposedly performing loans are likely to be able to live up to the pressure, and I will come back to that.  This is madhouse economics which will unravel as those interest rates rise and it is a big, big mistake.We are being asked to catch a falling knife.  We are told that for this €54 billion mortgage we will get all of these assets at a 30% discount.  When one really looks at the figures, that means we are paying €54 billion for what we are told is a €77 billion banks' asset book of loans most of which are not delivering according to their deeds.  Of the €77 billion, €9 billion is rolled-up interest.  It is interest on loans which just cannot be met and it will be given over to this public organisation to take on board as some kind of an asset.  These developers are already in trouble.  These loans are already impaired.  This interest is not being paid.  It is not an asset.  The Minister must take away that €9 billion and look at what he is buying.  He is buying a €68 billion book for €54 billion.  When one looks at that, it is not a 30% discount.  That, for starters, at best, would be a 20% discount.It is, however, worse than that because we are told that the value of these loans is €47 billion, as they are in mid-fall.  We are being told to stick out our hand and catch that value — €47 billion.  That value will go down.  We have very good evidence historically and otherwise that suggests the value of those loans could be down by as much as two thirds by the time they hit the bottom.  If they were to decrease by two thirds, we would end up with a loan book we should have paid €25 billion for and for which we are paying €54 billion.  We are paying more than twice what we should and we are being told it is a great deal.It is not a good deal, whatsoever.  We are being told there is some type of level 15% above the market value we are going to pay for these loans.  It is nowhere near 15% above market value, but rather 100% or more.  That is what the Government is asking ordinary people to pay, and there are enormous risks as regards the risk sharing we are speaking about.  When one considers the risks associated with these loan books, they would make one's toenails curl.  Some 2,000 customers are involved in all the loans being taken over, but there are 21,500 loans.  This means that for every one customer there are more than ten loans.  If one of those loans goes down, ten of them will go down.  That makes it extraordinarily risky, much riskier than any normal loan book and nowhere in the communications or legislation is that risk discussed or acknowledged.  This is a far riskier proposal than it seems at first sight.As regards the estimate of €54 billion it is asking us to accept, every single estimate the Government has produced in recent years has been so far wrong.  It has had four budgets in ten months because the estimates are wrong.  Every estimate on the way up in the economy is wrong.  All the advisers who helped it get those estimates are the same people working on these estimates.  It is an enormously risky process, on which we are taking a €54 billion interest only variable mortgage.  There is nowhere near a 5% risk sharing appropriate in this.  I heard the Green Party suggest it should be 50:50.  It should be more, in my view — the banks should take on all of this risk and the taxpayer should take on none.  There is a 5% risk element in this and for all of those risks I believe that is an enormous gamble.Take AIB, for example, as per the data given to us in the documentation yesterday when the legislation was introduced in the House.  AIB, for every one impaired loan, has two others which are vulnerable or on watch, an enormously risky banking situation.  Bank of Ireland, for every one impaired loan, has another one that has passed its due date, but has not yet been classed as impaired.  Anglo Irish Bank has 10,000 impaired loans and another 13,000 that are past due.  Irish Life & Permanent has six past due for every loan that is impaired.  Therefore there are enormous problems in relation to this.The ECB said that it had reservations about NAMA.  It said the reservations were that the banks have a self-interest in not lending this money.  It said there was a problem in relation to the risk sharing and that it preferred market value as opposed to this long-term economic value.  None of those complaints has been properly addressed.  There is no way, when €54 billion is given to our banks, that they will lend that money out into the economy.  They have borrowed the money from international banks in the first place to lend and as a result that €54 billion has to go back to pay the loans they got in order to give the money to our developers.There is one final issue as regards the choice being made by the Government.  The Government has an enormous obligation because it encouraged people to buy houses at the top of the market with 30-year and 40-year mortgages.  It must deliver economic growth.  It is faced with an economic problem which it divided into three.  It has given one part of it, Government cutbacks, to one consultancy group, a second part to the Commission on Taxation and the third part, fixing the banks, to a third consultancy group, Peter Bacon.  Each group has produced a solution to its particular part of the problem, but nowhere is the solution joined up.  Nowhere is there any suggestion that we should be looking at promoting economic growth rather than solving individual elements.  The thinking should be joined up and the economy needs a stimulus.  There is, however, no hope of stimulus in this bank plan for at least two years, and the Government is ignoring the idea of Fine Gael's "good bank", which would provide that stimulus immediately.  It has rubbished Fine Gael's proposal because it said we spoke about subordinated bondholders taking on the chin their responsibility and their losses.  When it comes to risk sharing, however, it says that subordinated bonds are the way forward, so that these will not have to be paid.  The inconsistency and hypocrisy speaks for itself.This is a really bad plan and the Government is wriggling and squirming and trying to sell it and shove it down people's throats.  It is a big mistake that will come back to haunt us.  It will not be this Government that has to fix up the mess, but other Administrations after it.  God love the people when this particular chicken comes home to roost.  It is a €54 billion variable interest rate interest-only mortgage for which in the end we are going to have to pick up an enormous tab.  It is a disgrace.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	219	It was important that Deputy Lee was able to get in the points as regards current mortgage holders and I am delighted he has put that on the record.The Taoiseach and the Government seem to believe that the challenge is to restore the banking system, whereas we on this side of the House want to change it fundamentally.  We want to change the way banking is practised and the way regulation is supposed to be done.  Anyone who believes this NAMA legislation will change the culture of banking is either naive or gullible.  The Taoiseach said at the IPA national conference on 9 September that we have to restore our banking system to full functioning so that credit is available to businesses and households, trade and investment and the jobs depending on them can proceed.  I take issue with the "full functioning" aspect.  Is that a declaration that the banks were fully functioning prior to the banking crisis?  I disagree with that initial premise because I do not want the banking system to go back to the way it was, giving out free money, 100% and 110% mortgages.  The banking system as it operated has crippled my generation, a generation of people with nooses around their necks with €500,000 to €600,000 mortgages, and people are absolutely frightened to death to hear reports that the French and German economies are coming out of recession because they know that interest rates will go up.  That is why I am delighted Deputy Lee raised the point about mortgage holders because there is nothing in the NAMA plan to give them protection.At the Fianna Fáil think-in this week the Taoiseach said we must fix the banks as quickly as possible and get them back lending.  Where was the decisiveness 12 or 18 months ago, when small businesses were going to the wall and there were articles about high street businesses in Letterkenny, Drogheda and other major towns where the blood was being sucked dry from local economies and the only businesses surviving were Lidl, Aldi, Tesco and Dunnes Stores?  That is the reality of what is happening and that decisiveness was not there.The Tánaiste referred to the "gratefulness" of the banks and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday that the banks needed to be grateful as regards the job we are about to do in relation to the NAMA legislation.  This was like parents telling a delinquent teenager that he or she better be grateful for the sacrifices they made in raising him or her into the twilight teenage years.  The banks are the delinquent ones, however, and delinquent teenagers or delinquent banks do not do grateful.  There is no point in the Minister imploring the banks to be grateful because it is like water off a duck's back.In Britain the debate has moved on from recapitalisation.  Already there is controversy over bankers receiving bonuses again.  The old culture is back and old habits are finding it very hard to die.  As regards the political debate that is not happening in this country, the discussion now taking place post-capitalisation in the UK and America has changed from the question of whether it is a socialist or capitalist model that is in place.  Here the Minister for Finance is about to inject the socialist ideal, getting every single taxpayer to bail out the banks.  Once they are bailed out they will revert to the capitalist model and the old culture that was in place as regards protecting the banks, their shareholders, the brokers and the bondholders.The Minister for Finance told a Sunday newspaper last weekend that throughout this banking crisis the onus is on the banks to attract private investment.  This is on the record.  The Minister said they had not been able to attract private investment and that he could not wait forever.  How does the Minister know the banks have not been able to attract private investment?  How do we know banks have not been offered fresh capital for some of their toxic loans in the past 12 to 18 months?  Does the Minister have access to information showing that banks were prepared to negotiate with potential investors in the past 12 to 18 months or were the banks just waiting for the NAMA train to come along?  Given the 50% drop in property prices, including commercial property and development land, would it not be prudent for an international investor to look at Ireland as a good investment?In order to justify this legislation, the Minister should provide evidence of banks having negotiated with potential investors.  I believe a sinister vacuum has been created by banks through lack of transparency and honesty.  The Minister needs to back up his statement that they have not been able to attract any private investment.  Does he mean there is no evidence of any type of international investors or bidders interested in some type of property having approached banks?  The Minister needs to clarify that statement, which is very dangerous, based on his communications with the banks.  He said that they have not been able to attract any private investment and that he cannot wait forever.  Let the Minister stand over that comment by coming in here and stating that neither AIB nor Bank of Ireland has had any approaches from international investors for the purchase of any property in their toxic balance sheet.  He should produce that evidence because it could raise a few issues.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	222	We are coming to the end of what has been an extraordinary 12 months not just in the life of the country, but also in the life of the world.  Last Monday marked the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, bringing with it the oil that for whatever reason was powering most of the international banking system.  That in addition to our own domestic issues has led us to the situation facing us today.  The accusations that the Government has not responded or has not responded quickly enough are unfair.  This House came back early last year to deal with the bank guarantee scheme, a scheme that was supported by the other side of the House and which has been renewed.  The House came back early once again in January to deal with the issue of Anglo Irish Bank and the impact its potential collapse would have had on the economy.  On the other side of the balance sheet, we have introduced a range of fiscal cuts — all opposed — in order to show that as a country we were gearing ourselves for the downturn ahead.NAMA and the proposals outlined in detail yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, provide us with a direction and purpose for how we will proceed.  I agree with much of what Deputy McHugh said about restructuring the banking system.  We are going to do that.  Yesterday, the Minister made a commitment that this would now be the focus of his work in terms of how the banking system operates here.  We cannot really do that unless we are in a position to provide capital to the banks.  I have no doubt that the Minister will respond to Deputy Joe McHugh's comments — I will draw his attention to them — about the banks being able to access cash.  One of the critical reasons they have been unable to provide funds to small businesses or mortgages is that they have not been able to access lending cash on the international markets or access it at a rate that could be passed on in a commercial way.  That is what NAMA is intended to rectify.It is not a write-off of €54 billion as many on the other side of the House will say.  That €54 billion is firstly an estimate that will be backed up by each and every loan that is being transferred into NAMA being examined and assessed.  Every loan is backed up by security for which we will get a real and proper value and not some type of inflated value.  That is another guarantee for the taxpayer in terms of the detailed approach being taken.It is unfortunate that Deputy George Lee has left.  I believe he used the term "mad economics" — he could look in the mirror himself.  To suggest a figure of €25 billion on that book is ludicrous.

Loans will be followed up.  Those who have the loans will still be followed up in the same fashion as they were previously.  While NAMA will ultimately solve the fiduciary and monetary issues facing our system, much work remains to be done on other responsibility issues.  I welcome the appointment of Dr. Patrick Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.  He brings international skills and experience and is not coming from the usual clearing house for Central Bank of Ireland governors, the Department of Finance.  That in itself is a major break with tradition and a major signal on the part of the Minister that the regulatory environment will change.I also welcome the commitment by the Taoiseach this morning that we will have a new director of financial regulation, somebody of high calibre and experience.  If the appointment of Dr. Patrick Honohan is anything to go by, we can look forward to somebody with real power and real teeth in order to ensure that we do not find ourselves in this situation again.  I also encourage the Deputies opposite to engage with the Minister given his commitment to discuss with them the appointment of people to NAMA so that they can be involved in that regard.However, other things remain to be done.  I agree with proposals floated this summer that we need a complete examination of the banking industry in Ireland and what went on particularly in the past five years.  The place to do it is in this House through the Committee of Public Accounts——

This morning Deputy Enda Kenny and this evening Deputy George Lee criticised the fact that bank shares rose this morning while ignoring the fact that the share price increase means the yield and return to the Government will increase through our shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB and that this value will assist us in the future.Since the legislation was published at the end of July, the Minister for Finance has shown himself to be very open to ideas and suggestions for improvements.  He has shown that he is willing to share and to take on board good ideas.Deputy Lee criticised the model on the basis that European Central Bank rates would increase, which is correct.  However, the Fine Gael model, of which he is a proponent, is built on €40 billion worth of ECB cash going into that bank.  So the same issue of rising ECB interest rates would apply to his magic bank, which we have already shown not to be properly funded, not to have an operating structure and certainly not capable of delivering a functioning banking system within seven weeks, which is what Deputy Lee has been promising.We have a chance to lead the debate in this House.  While we are not saying it is perfect, through NAMA we have a chance to complete the work that was started with the guarantee by sharing ideas and making suggestions.  I would love to see a response to the Minister's letter to leaders of the Opposition.  I hope they will take on board his invitation to submit changes.  That would be to the betterment of NAMA and would reflect well on both Houses of the Oireachtas.One would like to believe that this is the final piece of the jigsaw.  Deputy Lee was probably right in suggesting there is a time for joining up the various responses.  That can be done properly and efficiently in the committee system.  Under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Ahern the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is doing wonderful work.  Perhaps it is time for that committee to combine the work of dealing with the McCarthy report, the Commission on Taxation report and NAMA to give us an overall map of where we are going.  I have no doubt the Minister has that in mind, and the input of the committee will allow great progress in this regard.NAMA will never be a popular project.  It is not something people will like.  However, it is essential to get money flowing in our economy again.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	237	——particularly in my short time in the House.  It is not just a debate about new legislation but about how we can reform our economy and our banking system.  It is also about the events of the past and the pivotal area of banking, development, housing and regulation, as well as the kind of society we want to create out of the embers of the catastrophic actions which have landed Ireland — our country, my country — in this situation.In 1973, the Irish Banks' Standing Committee told the Committee on the Price of Building Land, which produced what is known as the Kenny report:The member Banks fully support any measures designed to control for the benefit of the community the price of land for housing and other forms of development.  They wish to make it quite clear that it is their agreed policy, in conformity with Central Bank guidelines on credit, to refuse generally to grant advances for speculative purposes and to state that this policy is actively pursued whenever, in the particular case of land purchases, an element of speculation is involved or detected.If that was the guiding spirit of the banks back then, the successors to those heads of Irish banks have disgraced themselves again, to paraphrase W.B. Yeats.  The Irish banks have acted disgracefully in recent years and they should be ashamed of themselves.  Their practices must never be allowed to be repeated.  The recklessness, the facilitation of speculative land purchases, and banking which amounted to nothing more than gambling were at the heart of the events which have led us to discuss the NAMA legislation.  That is why my party and I see a need for a cleaning out of these banks' boards and a successful conclusion to the current investigations being undertaken by the Office of Corporate Enforcement.  Members should make no mistake about it; people want to see white-collar crime punished.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	239	We have all talked to people in our clinics — pensioners who have lost everything, young couples who cannot pay their mortgages, business people weeping in our offices because they cannot pay the faceless companies for rent hikes in shopping centres all over the land — all because the banks have now put the squeeze on or, in some cases, lent too freely and in a profligate fashion.  We want to see the Office of Corporate Enforcement bring a rapid conclusion to its study of what is to happen to those who brought this country to the brink of bankruptcy.Retribution alone will not lead to recovery.  NAMA is about ensuring that the Irish taxpayer — the householder, the small or large businessman, the farmer — can get access to credit again.  As someone from a background in the SME community I know the importance of credit, bridging loans, overdraft facilities, and lending power, which has dried up over the past year.  There are people in the private sector who are willing to take a 25% wage cut in order to support their employers who have given them jobs over the years, particularly in the retail sector, where there have been fall-offs of up to 43% in the book trade and the shoe and clothes trade.  The Government, as the Minister reminded us yesterday, has played its part this year with actions such as the establishment of the credit clearing group, the export stabilisation fund and the job subsidy scheme to help those who need credit and ensure banks are providing credit where it is justified.  The provision that will be introduced to ensure the banks lend a certain amount of money is vital, and is something the Green Party is pleased to have achieved in the legislation.  The amendment must be clear and offer relentless oversight of the banks in this regard.Amendments have been put forward to ensure transparency in the NAMA legislation.  The criminalisation of lobbying and quarterly reports to the Minister are important.  We have had light-touch regulation and seen the departure of the chief executive of the Financial Regulator.  We want to make sure these mistakes do not happen again.  It is difficult to be in Government at a difficult time, but we will not shirk the responsibility of doing the right thing for the country.  I would like to see the establishment of an Oireachtas sub-committee to monitor the work of NAMA and to scrutinise the Minister on those quarterly reports.We all know that planning reform and the social dividend are key to making sure we are not reduced to these circumstances again.  It is sad to see Deputy Rabbitte find one of the key Green Party components of the Bill so amusing.  It was perverse of him to be so amused that this legislation is being used for social gain and the common good, which I would have thought a core Labour Party principle.  This legislation will be used to help alleviate the cost and pressure on the State to provide land for our schools and land banks.  I do not think there are many people around the country who have waited for years to see schools built — waited in vain because of the punitive cost — who would share the Deputy's humour at this initiative of social dividend.The social dividend aspect of this legislation, combined with reforms in other areas, provides a real opportunity to address the issues of housing supply and demand and standards which plagued this country during the boom years.  It is an opportunity for us to undo the damage of a property market in which more than 41% of new houses were acquired as investments or second homes and now remain idle.  We all know them in our constituencies; they are the houses with piles of leaflets, advertisements for Lidl and Aldi and Deputies' newsletters in the doors.  This was a market in which the number of social and affordable houses slumped to less than 1% of total housing stock in 2007 — which is a scandal — and in which a shamefully high proportion of rented accommodation did not meet minimum legal standards.We need to return to a housing environment in which basic housing needs guide the market, not speculation and property investment, which puts developers and landlords ahead of access to affordable housing.  These are policies which need to be implemented in tandem with the NAMA legislation.  Let us not forget there are hundreds of thousands of young couples who might never be able to afford a house unless we do something about the housing bubble.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Deputy Rabbitte's party colleague said last week that the windfall tax to deter speculation was too late to be of relevance.  If that is the case, Deputy Burton should remind Deputy Quinn of the Oireachtas committee he established in 1983, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, to examine "possible legislative measures to deal, in the interests of the common good, with the supply and cost of building land".  When he established the committee Deputy Quinn said the problem of land prices had got worse and had not eased since 1973 when the Kenny report was submitted to Government.  Neither that nor subsequent Labour Party Governments addressed this issue.  We in the Green Party are ensuring, through this measure, that land speculation is controlled and an 80% windfall land tax is implemented.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	243	In our new Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 we will make sure planning is the most dynamic part of the new legislation.  We must also prevent such a situation from arising again in the property market.The Labour Party's red NAMA and Fine Gael's magic-wand blue NAMA do not compare favourably with the current approach, which balances asset management, tight controls and taxpayer protection with social opportunities and provisions for preventing mistakes from happening again.I recently read T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, which is a marvellous poem about the human condition.  It is a stunning epitaph to what has gone before us which has brought us to this day’s debate on the NAMA legislation.  The wasteland must not be revisited except in the poetry books in our homes and libraries.  T. S. Eliot’s stark words about what happens to a greedy population should be read by everybody in the House.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	244	John Steinbeck wrote quite a bit about hardship as well.  The wasteland was described by him very clearly in the Grapes of Wrath.  It behoves us all, as we are in a poetic mood, to read all that he wrote about how those circumstances came about.  The one lesson to be learned from that, as the Acting Chairman and I well know, is that nothing has changed.  That is the sad part of it.  Unfortunately, many people on the opposite side of the House who recently spoke believe what they said.  They believe it on the basis that they have been told that this legislation is the solution to the problem.  As the Acting Chairman could tell the House, a former Committee of Public Accounts inquired into the activities of the banks fairly thoroughly and it identified all the issues that have come up to bite us again.  Following the DIRT inquiry, the banks gave a firm undertaking that they would never go down that route again, that they would attend to their fiduciary duties in an open and clear way, that there would be good governance and regular and independent audits and that they would in no way manipulate the finances of their respective institutions in a manner that would undermine the State and the interests of its citizens.  As was mentioned, despite all our efforts at that time, the late chairman of that committee lost his seat in the subsequent general election.  The Acting Chairman was a member of that committee, as were Deputy Rabbitte, myself and one or two others.  The one lesson we learned from dealing with that kind of organisation or group of people involved in big business is they do not care.  They could not care less about legislators.  To show their contempt for legislators, they embarked on the same course that they were on before.The Financial Regulator, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance said in the past six months that they all spoke out, but how did we not hear them?  How did the general public not hear them?  If they spoke out, why was Government policy not adjusted in accordance with their concerns and views?  All that happened in the past seven or eight years was that the people who did speak out and who raised concerns about the issues were ridiculed.  The people on this side of the House and the people outside of this House, a mere handful, who spoke out, raised questions and wondered what was going on were ridiculed.  They were told to get lost, they did not know what they were talking about, they were being unpatriotic and were undermining the economy.  It was such a stupid way to carry on, blindfolded and lemming-like.  The population were led over the edge of the abyss.  I can only conclude, and I may be wrong, that if all the people who did that to this country are not guilty, then the people who gave direction, instruction and were in government are guilty.  One way or the other, it is important that this nation finds out because if these crimes, which is what they are, go unpunished, I guarantee that in ten years time somebody will be sitting in this House reviewing the same old story again.Deputy Lee made an interesting comparison when he referred to the 15% market value upgrade to compensate the people who are to guide the economy forward.  It will be a type of bridge to help us move from the desperate position we are in now on to dry land, which the Government and the architects of this plan hope will happen and that we will be overtaken by inflation and positive measures in this economy and the worldwide economy.  The worldwide economic problem is totally different from the one that affects this country.  While there is a worldwide economic problem, we have our own self-invented one imposed on the people of this country by the State, the Government, the banks and the so-called experts.  Deputy Lee said it was more like a 100% mark-up because it was tied to the valuation and he is right.During the past five or six years we all heard that the cause of the economic bubble in the construction sector was the granting of 100% loans, but it was not because 150% and 170% loans were offered.  All one had to go was to search for a loan on the Internet or look up houses for sale on the various building sites.  The first two houses on a site advertised in a morning were offered for sale at €200,000, by that evening the price had increased to €250,000 and by the following day it had increased to €300,000.  It was a crazy situation.  Deputy Gogarty will be aware that in his village houses increased in value by €80,000 over one weekend.  How in God's name could that be tolerated anywhere?  Who was going mad?  The banking sector got into business with the construction sector and they decided to screw the whole population and to offer more and more money to each person competing in the market for a basic house, but they eliminated the first-time buyer from the market.  The first-time buyer was not required.  They decided to form companies, buy their own property, set up a management agency and rent property to the unfortunate potential first-time buyer at a rent that precluded him or her from ever being able to afford to take out a mortgage.  Stupid notions were put forward by various well-meaning people to the effect we should have a savings scheme for these people, that we should not help them out except by way of a savings scheme over a number of years as we all had to save hard when we were younger.  How in God's name could people take out a mortgage if they were already effectively paying a high mortgage by way of rent?  I could never conceive how people did not understand that.During the 1980s when, allegedly, things were bad in this country every Member at the time would have had regular meetings with their constituents, particularly first-time buyers.  There was never was a time, even in the bleakest of those days, that it was not possible to encourage a potential first-time buyer towards acquiring his or her own house.  All a person needed was a job or even the potential of getting a job and that person would be able to hold on to his or her house.  All the criticisms that were levelled at people at that time who were unemployed to the effect that they were not willing to work and so on was rubbish.  Those people proved that as soon as soon as the opportunity arose.I do not know if anyone else interpreted a reference in the Taoiseach's speech this morning that way I did, but I found it alarming.  In the second paragraph on page 5 of his speech he said:The Government's existing recapitalisation package includes a number of measures to boost lending and underpin economic activity.  These measures include a commitment by the two main banks to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises in 2009 by 10% over the 2008 levels . . .He said to increase lending capacity; he did not say to increase lending.  Lending is currently zilch and I do not know what the lending capacity is because nobody knows that.  Lending is zero and one can increase on zero by any percentage and it will still be nothing.  The Taoiseach went on to say, ". . . and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers [in 2009]."  He again used the word "capacity".  He did not say to provide an additional 30% in lending.  In other words, the banks and the lending institutions will have the potential to lend an extra 30% to first-time buyers over their capacity to lend in 2009.  Nothing is being loaned currently.  Nobody cares about first-time buyers.  What NAMA proposes to do, sadly by one means or another, is to once again make first-time buyers shoulder the burden, which has been dropped on them and the rest of the population, by having to pay increased prices for their houses.  It is incredible.Up to recently, the maximum loan available through the various local authority shared ownership schemes was €185,000.  That is ironic as it could be a saver for them.  Then, all of a sudden, when the country went bust it was increased to €250,000.  I never heard the like of that in my life.  I do not know how something like that could happen.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, who is sitting opposite, understands.  He deals with that kind of situation himself.  I had occasion to argue with various financial institutions in recent years.  I could not understand what they were trying to do, but now I know.  I can see it all now.  The Taoiseach continued in his speech to say:The Financial Regulator is monitoring compliance with these lending targets.  Furthermore, AIB and Bank of Ireland have each created funds to support projects which have a positive impact on the environment or will provide innovation in clean energy and have committed to seed capital funds, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland, to support further the creation and development of new enterprises.That is the bit to appease the Greens to which various other speakers referred.  If the Green Party Members across the Chamber believe that, they will believe anything.  I have to hand it to the Government in general and Fianna Fáil in particular.  Their antics in the past 12 months would make a pet fox look dull.  They knew full well what was going on.  They know that the culprits who created the economic situation in this country should be before the courts.  Is that not a fact?  In any other country they would be.  They do not care because there is no chance of that happening.  The Greens and everybody else can talk as much as they like about it but if it was a business person or a householder falling behind in their mortgage he or she would quickly be before the courts.There are plenty of such people before the courts at this moment.  I heard somebody from the Government side of the House say in recent days that there is no evidence of that.  They had better believe there is evidence on a daily basis of people coming before the courts.  I have been there myself to speak on behalf of constituents who find themselves in that situation.  Other Members of this House have done so as well.  For God's sake, we need to recognise what is going on around us.  We are in a serious situation.It has been suggested that no rules nor laws have been broken by the institutions.  Then why do we have the Companies Act 1990?  Some of us spent six months in Kildare House on Committee Stage of that Bill.  We were buried alive while going through the legislation in detail.  What were we there for?  What about the procedures relating to persons found guilty of malfeasance or a failure to uphold the good conduct of the company?  What about the sanction of them being banned from ever holding office?  What about them being discharged dishonourably from the office they held?  In spite of that, what do we do in this country?  We say, "Sorry, you're nice guys.  You made a bit of a mess of it and we have to give you a different job.  Here is a little golden handshake as you go out the door.  We do not want much to be said about it.  There might be some hassle about it.  Let us be clear, you did well".That is what the public is concerned about.  That is what makes people angry.  The Government has managed to turn that anger on the Members of the Oireachtas and the institutions of the State.  For their own reasons some media outlets want to do the same thing.  It is now commonly recognised that it was the institutions of State that were wrong.  Let us not forget some of what is being peddled in the context of the Lisbon treaty emanates from some elements in Whitehall.  They say the political classes have lost their touch.  I thought we got rid of the political classes in 1922.  What is happening now is that public confidence in the Oireachtas is being undermined.  That is a serious issue and will have widespread implications in the short term as well as the long term.  This is a serious issue as when it happened previously in Europe there were disastrous consequences.I say to those who say that such things cannot happen again to read back on what the people who spoke about those issues said in the 1930s.  The first thing that happens is that public confidence in the institutions diminishes and then they have to be replaced.  It is the replacement that always worries me.  One of the stories being peddled will suit the Government at the moment, but it will not always suit the Government that the Opposition can do nothing either, which means nothing can be done.  That is the first sign of despair and that is the first danger of society breaking down.  It may be all right for political reasons to castigate the Opposition but its Members are the people who have asked the necessary questions.Six or seven months ago I heard the presenter of a radio show inquire about how the Opposition had never said anything about what was going on.  He never heard the Opposition ask any questions.  Where was he?  He was on the tiger's back racing for the line as if his life depended upon it.  There is no use in people blaming the Opposition for the situation that is now unfolding.  The Government was running the country and it had absolute responsibility.  The sooner people realise that the better for themselves.  I will not criticise the Green Party for going into Government in the past two years.  To quote another party leader who went into Government in the not too distant past: "These are people we can do business with".  Unfortunately the Green Party is doing business with Fianna Fáil now and there will be consequences for both parties.The current situation requires fairly substantial retribution against those people who caused the problem.  In any other jurisdiction they would be before the courts.  I cannot understand why they are not.  Everybody else is subject to the rule of law and to punishment, but in this country they have decided to punish the institutions of the State and the Members of the House, reduce their salaries on the basis that they did something wrong and create the impression that everybody is crooked.  That is a great way to undermine public confidence in everything and there is where the danger lies.Deputy White referred to an issue previously.  Dr. Bacon made many recommendations on the survival package.  He also produced three reports on the housing sector.  It is extraordinary that the same artist comes back to visit the scene of the crime with a view to addressing the problems he originally created.  That is ironic.There is a notion abroad that if the cost of building land is reduced that will solve all of the problems.  It will not, because even if the building land was given to the developers for nothing it would not affect the price of houses because of the role played by greed.  The same thing would happen if development land was given free to the builders in the morning.  It is a myth that the provision of land to developers for nothing or half nothing would result in a reduction in the price of housing.  If one needs proof, one can check on some of the lands that were sold for exactly that before the boom started and see what became of them very quickly without ever a sod being turned.The Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, knows I could talk for a lot longer.  He could talk for a lot longer also.  He and I were together on an inquiry that relates exactly to the issues we are now talking about, which are seen to be causes of the damage to the economy.  Nothing happened although we made the sacrifices.  We took a lot of abuse at the time but we have not forgotten.

An overwhelming case can be made to ensure that those at the helm during the crisis in the banking sector get punished where the law has been flouted.  The problem is that in many cases the law was lax.  There was not enough regulation or enforcement.  No more than in a murder or criminal investigation, one cannot bring a matter before the Director of Public Prosecutions until one has evidence to prosecute the case.  My party colleagues and I — and I am sure all Members of this House — would be abhorred if a high flying fat cat executive, who profiteered from a loss making situation at the expense of the taxpayer, were to get off on a technicality.  We do not want that to happen.  I am reassured by the commitment of the Minister for Finance to my party and others that the issue is being followed up and that the full rigours of the law will be brought to bear.  Time will tell.  I share Deputy Bernard Durkan's sentiment in this regard.Deputy Durkan also mentioned that banks went into business with speculators and the construction sector, which is true.  Those comrades also went into business with councillors throughout the country.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, spoke earlier of a number of think-ins held in Monaghan where he altered the development plan.  Tracts of land in other places across Ireland were rezoned not alone by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, but by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, land that did not need to be rezoned because it far exceeded the demographic requirement for the area.  In this case, through legitimate political donations which all of the major parties readily accepted, the business contract was signed, the land was delivered, the developers had it rezoned and made a profit and were able to borrow from the banks on the back of that speculative process.  The banks fed into this; they also donated to political parties.

The beginning is the legislation before us and where we go from here, how we protect the Irish taxpayer and how we bring liquidity back into the system.  As a Member of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I must point my party's disagreement with the concept of the need to get back to economic growth.  In the narrow economic thinking, the voodoo economics under which the global system operates, we may need to do this, but long term one cannot have unbridled economic growth because one of the main factors of production is scarce.  The resources of this planet are scarce.  We cannot continue producing as if there is no tomorrow.  We must find a different, more sustainable model.

It was based on money that at the time was related to the gold standard.  That no longer applies.  The lending process now requires a certain amount of deposits going through the system and is dependent on channelling debt throughout the system.  When a person puts approximately €1,200 into a bank, this eventually leads to approximately €1 million worth of money floating through the system, money which does not really exist and which, if some of loans are overspread or if people start trading in loans as they did in the US leading to the creation of this whole problem, results in the collapse of the system.

That is why, in the short term interests of this country, the economic interests of ordinary people being obtain loans for home improvements, business or in order to have their wages paid, we must get the banking system working again.  That is the reason the Green Party is supporting this legislation.  If we had our way we would change the whole global system of economics.  Unfortunately, we cannot do that; it is beyond even our reach.

A number of varied proposals have been put forward.  On the Labour Party nationalisation scheme, Deputy Eamon Gilmore said it is not nationalisation because it is only for a temporary period.  However, as Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve in the US suggested recently, if a government does go down the temporary nationalisation route, there is no guarantee that it will not be medium or long term.  He said: "If the government takes over a bank, the taxpayers tacitly acquire the assets, thereby inheriting all the uncertainties over valuation."  If a bank has a negative net worth when it is nationalised, it is the taxpayer who will fill the hole.

We in the Green Party contend that NAMA, if done properly, will cost the taxpayer less than nationalisation.  Nationalisation will lead to an outflow of investment in the country and there is no guarantee in terms of how long that would last.  It also raises issues in regard to the 85,000 ordinary decent people employed in the banking sector in this country.  I am speaking not of the individuals I referred to last year as scum — those who messed it up for all of us — but of ordinary workers.  I apologise to any bank worker who thought I was referring to them in that way.

It has received more than €4 billion in capital funding to date and has lost approximately €15 billion in deposits.  The Central Bank has had to make up the majority of the difference through a €10 billion liquidity injection.  If the State were to wind up Anglo Irish Bank, the cost to the taxpayer would be in the region of €64 billion.  The same would apply in respect of the larger banks if nationalised, even on a temporary basis.  In that context, it is riskier to go down that route.

Nobody denies that such risks apply.  It is akin to a Jehovah's Witness being told that his or her child requires a blood transfusion but there is nevertheless no guarantee the child's life will be saved.  My party does not accept corporate donations and abhors the system of backslapping and the culture of corruption that has prevailed.  We have reservations about the NAMA proposal.  However, having searched our collective conscience within membership discussions, of which there will be more in due course, we realised that something must be done.  Our membership recognises that NAMA with improvements is probably the least worst option.  Many good people in our party have fed into the process of consultation in their efforts to improve the proposal.The idea of an 80% windfall tax on rezoning was proposed in the Kenny report decades ago and will now finally be introduced within two years of the Green Party entering government.

There were some significant achievements during the ten years of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government but there were many follies too.  Instead of dwelling on the past, the Government must proceed with clearing up the mess, hopefully with the constructive support of the Opposition.  That is what we are trying to do by, for example, including a social dividend element in the legislation.

I am merely pointing out the reality in some areas.In regard to NAMA, there will always be something of a guessing game in regard to the valuation issue, and there has been much talk of risk-sharing.  The estimated valuation draw-down has been put at €47 billion, with the €54 billion being paid representing a premium of €7 billion.  Some €2.7 billion of that is incumbent on the banks to cover, with the rest incumbent on the State.  It is reasonable to argue that this does not represent a fair sharing of the risk element.  I expect my party members to have strong views on this.  However, it has also been widely acknowledged that the capitalisation of the banks will not be complete even at these calculations and it may well be that further investment in either or both of the two major commercial banks will be necessary.  I heard a suggestion on "Drivetime" this evening that a stake of 40% in AIB is likely.  It could well be 60%, which would amount to nationalisation without the drawbacks.  We do not know precisely what is going to happen but it is clear that the State's take-up of the banking sector will increase, which means the risk is then shared on what would work out at a 50:50 basis, primarily because if the banks benefit, the taxpayer, via the State, will also benefit.  It is a no-brainer in one sense but highly risky in another.  There is no way around the taking of that risk.I acknowledge that Fine Gael's proposal was diligently researched and put forward in the best interests of the State.  The same is true of the plan put forward by the Labour Party.  I do not accept for one minute that either party is motivated by blind ideology or pure populism.  I accept that a case can be made for nationalisation on a temporary basis, as proposed by the Labour Party.  However, a consideration of the risks and drawbacks of each of the proposals makes clear that a finely honed version of NAMA is the least risky of all.  This is not to say there is no risk involved.I will conclude by referring to an e-mail received from one of our members pointing out the similarities between NAMA and a story he proceeded to relate.  He spoke of a friend who put a younger brother through university, providing accommodation in his family home and subsidising his expenses as he studied for his doctorate.  The young man went to on graduate and a week after securing employment asked to borrow his older brother's car.  The latter's car was being serviced so he allowed his younger brother to borrow his wife's motor.  The next morning the keys appeared on the hall table with a note apologising for scratching the car which had been left at a local garage to be repaired.The correspondent's friend apologised to his wife and promised to sort out the damage.  However, he received a telephone call in work later that day explaining that his younger brother had also caused serious damage to a neighbour's car.  The man promised to reimburse the neighbour and proceeded to lodge €3,000 to the latter's account as settlement of the damage.  At this stage it would have been cheaper to claim on the insurance but once the money was handed over it was too late.  The damage to the spouse's car was also greater than first reported.  The man was not sure whether his younger brother qualified for open driving because he was 30 years of age and the policy specified that the driver must be over 30.  Savings for holidays were now committed to the neighbour.  When the repair estimate came in at €7,500, the man's wife was furious and demanded that his younger brother be reported to the Garda or thrown out of the house.  The brother showed little remorse, merely shrugging his shoulders and mumbling a half-hearted apology.  This immediately calls to mind the comment by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the banks should be grateful for the help they are receiving.  Will they be grateful?  To paraphrase the Bailey brothers: Will they damn.There was no question of the correspondent's friend securing the money from his younger brother because the latter had huge debts for which the former was guarantor.  Moreover, the younger brother was on probation in his new job.  Throwing him out of the house would only delay any chance of repayment.  Involving the Garda might endanger the new job and the bank might call in the loan for which the older brother was guarantor as they were rolling over the debt at student interest rates — something similar to the European Central Bank rate of 1.5% — but with an option to terminate.  If the bank called in the loan to the younger brother, it would have tipped the family finances deeply into the red as a result of the punitive interest rates.  The correspondent's friend is still seething over the situation, suffering bad feeling from his wife, children and neighbour and a lack of meaningful compensation from his brother.  The latter has as yet no resources worth speaking of.As a nation, we have a similar problem with banks and developers.  The Government acted on insufficient information, as provided by the banks, and made promises in the form of guarantees to deposit and bond holders.  Nationalising the banks would be the equivalent of throwing the younger brother out of the house.  It might make us feel better but would probably cost more in the long run.  Reneging on promises would cause the bond markets to charge higher interest assuming we were even able to obtain loans.  NAMA is essentially unfair in this respect but the reality is——

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application from the individual concerned on 10 August 2009.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. In this case further information is required and the claim cannot be further processed until this information is received. This is causing a further delay in paying the applicant, in addition to the delays being experienced arising from the unprecedented high volume of claims on hand.

Children will qualify for the free preschool year where they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at the start of each academic year.  The application of age range is being interpreted as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  In September 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2006 or on or before 30 June 2007 will qualify, and so on in subsequent years.  Each qualified child will be eligible for one free preschool year.Services participating in the scheme will be required to provide the pre-school year without charge.  Full and part-time services may charge parents for additional services provided they are clearly optional and children not availing of such services continue to receive an appropriate programme based provision.Also, services may include additional hours.  For example, a full daycare service which operates for 50 weeks of the year must provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day free under the scheme, but may charge parents for additional hours availed of.  A sessional playschool open 38 weeks of the year may offer parents an additional 30 minutes per day in return for additional fees, as only 3 hours per day will be free under the scheme.  It is, however, anticipated that the majority of places availed of under the scheme will be of the standard 3 hours duration, and no charge applying to additional hours will arise in these cases.

The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) subsidises childcare costs for low paid and disadvantaged parents in community based, not for profit childcare facilities.  Funding for CCSS services increased from €37 million in 2007, to over €50 million in 2008, and has substantially reduced the fees paid by most parents using these facilities.  The CCSS will continue to support community based, not for profit childcare facilities in 2010.  Consideration will be given to the design of a successor programme to the CCSS between now and the end of 2010, when the scheme is scheduled to conclude.

While the advice being provided is focused on the Transport 21 programme, the contract is not limited to advice on capital projects only.  As part of an out of court settlement of a High Court case taken by Digital Messenger, trading as Swords Express, my Department undertook to pursue an inquiry under Section 25(2) of the Transport Act 1958 in relation to a decision to note the re-routing of the Dublin Bus 41X service from Swords to Dublin City via the Port Tunnel.  The terms of the settlement made it clear that the pursuit of the inquiry would be supported by the engagement of consultants.As a result my Department engaged Booz and Company to a carry out a review of its decision. The arrangement with Booz and Company was pursued as part of the overall engagement with that company as referred to above on the understanding that an additional fee would be made available to them. The report prepared by Booz was made available to Digital Messenger and Dublin Bus who were invited to make submissions before I made the final decision.Before the engagement with Booz and Company was finalised, the company was required to propose a project plan to the Department, which included the identification of the staff that would be assigned to the task, the approach to be taken and the estimated fee. Fee levels for different staff members had been set in the Department's main contract with the company.   Booz and Company can call upon the expertise of a range of transport experts, including transport planners and economists.  The lead consultant for this review was a transport planner and engineer with 17 years experience as a consultant.  The cost of this review was €23,110.A subsequent submission made in June 2009 by Dublin Bus to make a further amendment to the route of the 41X service was also referred to Booz and Company in view of their prior engagement in relation to the consideration of the original re-routing of that service. The same project manager took charge of the project and the cost of that task was €2,526.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 43, 46, 52, 53 and 56 together.In 2008, Ireland spent €920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA). This represented approximately 0.59 % of our Gross National Product (GNP).  For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach €696 million. €571 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Aid, with the balance of €125 million being contributions to development co-operation by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget. To date approximately 75% of the 2009 funding allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs has been disbursed to partners and programmes.  Based on current projections, ODA this year will represent at least 0.48% of GNP. This means that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis. This is an enormous achievement in the context of the current economic circumstances and one of which we should all be justifiably proud.The Government very much regrets having to make the decision to reduce the 2009 development assistance budget. However, it must be recognised that this necessary decision was taken in the context of the economic situation facing the country. Its sole objective is to assist in stabilising the public finances. This is a fundamental prerequisite for the resumption of economic growth, which is the only sustainable way Ireland can meet future ODA commitments.  The Government recognises that the reduction in the ODA allocation for 2009 was significant. However it follows a period of unprecedented growth. The figures speak for themselves. At the start of this decade, Ireland's ODA stood at €254 million — by last year it had reached €920 million — more than trebling in volume. In the same period, our percentage share of GNP spent on development assistance increased from 0.30 % to 0.59% — effectively doubling.The Government also recognises that it will now be more difficult to achieve the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. Nonetheless we will continue to work towards that target, and will make a full assessment of our capacity to achieve it in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget. It is important to note that Ireland is still significantly ahead of all but a few EU Member States in making progress towards achieving the broad EU target of 0.7% for ODA by 2015.While the Government is very much aware of the implications of the recent budgetary revisions for our own aid programme, increasing volumes is only part of the story of development assistance. Spending aid effectively, while meeting the needs of the world's poorest, is an essential characteristic of a quality programme. The OECD DAC peer review, has described Ireland as "champion in making aid more effective" and that "Irish Aid is a strong cutting edge development programme". I will ensure that these high standards are maintained.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The formal framework for members of the Government to meet members of the Northern Ireland Executive is through the North-South Ministerial Council as provided for in Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement. They meet, however, also in other contexts.  There have been forty-four ministerial meetings of the Council, including in plenary and institutional format, since restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions in May 2007. Since 1 April 2009 there has been one plenary meeting, one institutional format meeting and ten sectoral meetings of the Council. The ten sectoral meetings covered Health and Food Safety, Aquaculture and Marine, Inland Waterways, Language, Special EU Programmes, Trade and Business Development, Agriculture, Education, Tourism and Transport. Each of these sectoral meetings involved a Government Minister and his or her Ministerial counterpart in the North, as well as an accompanying Executive Minister.I hosted the fourth meeting of the Council in Institutional format at Farmleigh on 28 April 2009. This meeting was attended by the First Minister, deputy First Minister, Junior Minister Donaldson and the Minister for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie MLA. We had a broad discussion of the economic downturn and the budgetary challenges facing both jurisdictions. We also had a good exchange on EU issues and on practical measures designed to promote greater cross-border mobility.At the plenary meeting of the Council in Farmleigh on 6 July, the Government delegation was led by the Taoiseach and the Northern Ireland Executive delegation by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. We reviewed key developments in the NSMC since the previous such meeting in January. This included the close cooperation between relevant authorities North and South following the recent swine flu outbreaks and a cross-border agreement on the removal of waste illegally dumped in Northern Ireland. The Council also discussed progress on the A5 and A8 road upgrade projects.The meeting also included a wide-ranging examination of the current economic challenges. The Taoiseach briefed the Council on the Government's plans to restore competitiveness to the economy and to return to a path of sustainable public finances. My colleague the Minister for Finance briefed Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive on the proposed establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and its implications for the property sector in Northern Ireland. We also discussed some of the budgetary challenges likely to be faced by the Executive in the coming years and examined where there might be potential to expand our co-operation in areas of mutual interest.Members of the Government have also met their Northern Ireland counterparts during meetings of the British-Irish Council. The Council meets at Summit level and, more frequently, at Ministerial and official level, to discuss matters of mutual interest. My colleague Mr. Micheál Kitt T.D., the then Minister of State for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, attended the BIC Environment Ministerial meeting in Jersey on 17 April. The Northern Ireland Executive was represented by the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Sammy Wilson MP MLA, and Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Conor Murphy MP MLA.  As North-South contact has become part of routine Ministerial business in both jurisdictions, meetings also take place outside those frameworks. Most recently the Minister for Finance met his northern counterpart on 8 September to discuss issues related to the National Assets Management Agency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I condemn the criminal actions of those responsible for the bomb discovered last week in south Armagh. The lives of local people going about their everyday business, in their homes and in the wider community, were put at serious risk by an unrepresentative few who have no support for their actions.  I wish to pay tribute to the security authorities on both sides of the border who worked together to secure the area, render the device safe, and in the process averted an appalling tragedy. Their work underlines the close cooperation which exists between the authorities north and south, and the notably effective coordination between the PSNI and the Gardaí.Those who made and planted this bomb attempted to undermine the remarkable progress on this island in recent years. It is clear that the vast majority of people irrespective of their political views are determined that they will not succeed. The relevant authorities will continue to cooperate to ensure that these criminals are brought to justice.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	340	As recommended in the 2006 Government White Paper on Irish Aid, an independent Management Review of Irish Aid was carried out by consultants Farrell Grant Sparks. The Management Review of Irish Aid examined the governance, management and capacity requirements needed to ensure quality and accountability in an overseas aid programme including in the context of the decentralisation of the Irish Aid programme from Dublin to Limerick. The Review was overseen by a Steering Committee composed of senior officials representing the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance. The Review was the most comprehensive examination to date of the Government's overseas aid programme structures and systems.The report emphasises that the Government's overseas aid programme is an integral part of foreign policy and, as such, that the aid programme is an integral part of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Government has approved the Report's recommendations regarding enhanced governance arrangements aimed at ensuring a more effective integration of the programme within the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The report recommends inter alia the creation of a small new, expert body made up of national and international expertise, to advise the Government on the aid programme. This body would report on an annual basis to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development.With specific regard to oversight within the overseas aid programme, the report concluded that there is a rigorous process of internal checks and controls at field level and at headquarters level operated primarily through the Management Information Framework (MIF) and through the financial and internal audit systems. In the last year a number of new specialists have been employed to further enhance monitoring and evaluation capacity.  Earlier this year, the Irish Aid programme was the subject of a comprehensive Peer Review process under the auspices of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. The Programme was endorsed strongly for its quality and effectiveness. The Review Team acknowledged the focus on accountability and oversight within the Programme.  I have arranged for a copy of the report of the Management Review to be forwarded to the Dáil Library and for it to be published on the websites of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 to 51, inclusive, and 60 together.Ireland has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad, as well as the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Secretariat in Belfast and the North-South Ministerial Council Joint Secretariat in Armagh.  The Irish diplomatic network provides essential consular services, diplomatic representation and commercial services overseas. A number of missions also play a key role in the delivery of Ireland's development aid programme. Our network is modest in scale when compared to other equivalent European States; three quarters of our missions consist of only two or three diplomatic officers.The size and scale of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, and as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, any expansion can only be undertaken having regard to clear national priorities and available resources. The significant budgetary pressures currently being faced by my Department, as is the case for all Government Departments, means that any decision to open a new Mission overseas must be on the basis of an anticipated significant return for the State.  The United Arab Emirates was identified as a country where increased diplomatic representation would offer significant potential economic value to Ireland. Accordingly, and in order to take advantage of this potential, the Government decided to establish an Embassy in Abu Dhabi, which will open this Autumn.  In addition, the Strategic Review of US-Ireland Relations was launched by the Taoiseach in March of this year. The Review recommended the opening of a Consulate General of Ireland in Atlanta. The implementation of this recommendation is currently under consideration.In light of the current challenges in the public finances, the Government is examining all areas of expenditure to identify where savings can be made, while minimising the impact on front-line services provided to the public. Any consideration of possible Embassy closures will be made in this context, such as the recent decision to close the Consulate General in Cardiff.  I understand that the submission made to the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes by the Department of Finance set out a number of scenarios for mission closures to include the possible closure of Consulates and Embassies in North America and also Embassies in Asia and Europe. My Department also made a submission to the Special Group which is available at the following link: http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/dfa.pdf .The report from the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made some recommendations relating to my Department, including the reduction in the size of our diplomatic network. However, it did not specify particular missions for possible closure but rather gave a proposed saving of €14 million which the group believe could be achieved through the closure of 20 missions. These recommendations, along with all the recommendations set out by the Special Group, will be considered by Government as part of the Estimates process.In the Government's "Smart Economy" document, published at the end of 2008, my Department committed to reviewing its network of Missions abroad in order to ensure that they are operating at an optimum level of efficiency, are delivering tangible services and outcomes for the benefit of Ireland and its citizens, and that resources are aligned with our strategic objectives. The review, which is ongoing, is all the more important in the light of current budgetary pressures.  In carrying out this review, full account will need to be taken of both the operational and reputational costs and the potential financial savings of Embassy closures.  I can assure the Deputy that my objective, to the greatest extent possible and within the limits of available resources, is to maintain the capability of Ireland's diplomatic network overseas in order to promote our key objectives abroad, particularly support for our economic recovery.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States.  We have emphasised our strong support for the undocumented in all our engagements with the US Administration and Congress, including during meetings earlier this year with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and key Congressional leaders.As the Deputy will be aware, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, the Government has been actively pursuing a bilateral approach, aimed at facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. The approach has had three core objectives: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term E3 working visas; and a solution for our undocumented.  While the inclusion of Ireland in an expanded version of the E3 programme would provide extensive new opportunities for Irish people to work in the United States and help ensure that a new generation of undocumented Irish does not develop, our friends on Capitol Hill have been clear that the status of the undocumented Irish cannot be addressed in isolation from other ethnic groups, including by way of an E3. Their advice is that the best prospect for a solution for the undocumented continues to lie with comprehensive immigration reform.In June, President Obama met with a range of key Congressional figures, including supporters and opponents of reform, to discuss this issue and identify how to begin fixing what he has described as a broken immigration system. His statement, following the meeting that his "Administration is fully behind an effort to achieve comprehensive immigration reform" was welcomed by the Taoiseach in a personal letter he sent to President Obama in July, which outlined the Government's strong support for the undocumented.  As President Obama has noted, immigration remains ‘a sensitive and politically volatile issue' in the United States. Bi-partisan support is considered vital to the success of comprehensive reform and our friends on Capitol Hill have made it clear that progressing legislation will continue to present significant challenges. The challenges the Administration is experiencing in progressing its immediate legislative priority of healthcare reform may also delay action on comprehensive reform.With the passing of Senator Edward Kennedy, Ireland and Irish-America has lost a great friend and leader. An embodiment of the Irish immigrant story, he was a champion of many causes, including, of course, comprehensive immigration reform. His strong support for the undocumented, his understanding of their plight, was unwavering. While the immediate prospects for immigration reform remain uncertain, the Government is determined to build on Senator Kennedy's legacy by working closely with our many friends in Congress to find a solution for our undocumented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Unfortunately, no part of the world is totally free from human rights abuses.  As has been stated on previous occasions, in response to similar Questions, it is not the policy of the Government to draw up a ‘league table' of countries deemed guilty of the most serious human rights abuses.  The complexity and specificity of individual country situations could render such an exercise difficult and probably of little value.  Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, the Government closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations.We have a number of channels through which we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question: either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, including, in the case of the latter, through the new Universal Periodic Review process whereby the human rights performance of each UN State is reviewed.  Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. At these UN bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions and introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe provides opportunities for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.  The extent to which individual States comply with international human rights standards and obligations varies.  Ireland urges all States to comply with their international obligations and in this regard stands ready, if requested, to assist States in complying with their obligations.The risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak.  Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and this concern is at the heart of Ireland's development co-operation programme.  Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including by strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Support is also provided for legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses.  Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The EU is closely following the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as that country recovers from the effects of the brutal 1996-2003 civil war.  While much of the country has achieved a degree of stability, several localised conflicts have continued, most notably in the east.  These conflicts have in many cases been characterised by an appalling degree of brutality, with large-scale attacks on the civilian population and widespread sexual violence.At present, the security situation in the North and South Kivu provinces in Eastern DRC is precarious. This region was recently the scene of serious fighting between ethnic Tutsi militias and the armed forces of both the DRC and Rwanda. The humanitarian fall-out of this insecurity is immense, with reports of a massive increase in violence against the civilian population. Current estimates place the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region at 1.6 million. I am greatly concerned by reports that the work of the international humanitarian community has been impeded by the worsening security situation. I strongly urge all parties to protect the civilian population of North and South Kivu and to allow MONUC, the UN mission to the DRC, and humanitarian organisations there to carry out their work without interference.The EU is working to promote a negotiated end to the conflicts which persist and to develop the capacity of the Congolese state to protect its people. It fully backs the work of MONUC to which Ireland contributes three members of the Defence Forces as military liaison officers. The EU's Special Representative for the Great Lakes region, Mr. Roeland van de Geer, leads the Union's efforts to promote the stabilisation of eastern DRC. The EU also has two ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) missions in the country, which provide assistance to the DRC authorities on security sector reform and police reform.The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to the DRC, and in 2009 has allocated €45 million to address the needs of vulnerable populations there. The UN also plays a major role in addressing humanitarian needs in DRC. For our part, Ireland has been able to respond quickly to the humanitarian dimension of the crisis in DRC. An airlift of emergency relief supplies was made to eastern DRC in December 2008. Thus far in 2009, Irish Aid has allocated more than €3.7 million in humanitarian funding to the DRC through UN and NGO partners, bringing our total humanitarian support to the country since 2006 to over €26 million. We also have two members of the Rapid Response Corps on 6 month deployments with the UN in the DRC.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid, is recognised internationally for its lead role in ensuring the effectiveness of development aid. The report of the peer review of the aid programme, which was published in April by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, described Irish Aid as "a strong, cutting edge development cooperation programme" focused on delivering results. It stated that "Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective". In the face of global economic crisis, when aid budgets internationally are under pressure, we owe it to the people of the developing world to redouble our efforts to ensure that international development assistance is clearly focused on achieving results for the poorest people and communities in the world. Ireland will continue to play a strong international role in this regard.Ireland's development aid programme provides assistance to over ninety developing countries. It has a particular focus on nine programme countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic support. These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Malawi, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia. In our Programme Countries, development strategies are agreed in consultation with national Governments in support of their own poverty reduction strategies. These agreed strategies outline the areas where Irish Aid will provide support over a three to five year period. They contain monitoring frameworks with indicators and targets against which to measure improvements in basic services. The promotion of good governance is an essential element of all our country strategies. Irish Aid also works in cooperation with other international donors to strengthen public financial management systems and institutions of Government, such as the Auditor General function, in order to eliminate waste and corruption.In addition, Irish Aid supports a number of initiatives at international level which are helping to improve governance. This includes assistance towards the work of the leading anti-corruption NGO, Transparency International, which is helping to fight corruption globally, and the Association of Western European Parliamentarians for Africa which is helping to build the oversight capacity of Parliaments in Eastern Africa.The Government has put in place rigorous accounting and audit controls for Irish Aid, to ensure its programmes are regularly audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid's own Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs. This is essential in order to ensure that funding is directed to those areas most in need, is used for the purposes intended and represents the best value for money. We will continue to deliver on our commitment that all aid funded by the taxpayer will benefit the poorest and most vulnerable in the countries with which Irish Aid is working.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The crime of genocide, as defined in international law, involves the commission of acts with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.  These acts may include killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.Situations which fully meet this definition are thankfully extremely rare.  Nevertheless, there are a number of current situations in Africa which give rise to extreme concern.  The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide is mandated to alert the international community to the potential of genocide in a particular country or region.  The mandate of the Special Adviser requires him to focus on prevention, and specifically excludes him from making a determination of whether genocide has already occurred or not. In his most recent annual report of February 2009 the current Special Adviser, Francis Deng, described specific situations of concern in Africa including DRC, Kenya and Darfur.I support the work of the Special Adviser as I do the recognition by the wider international community of its responsibility to work to prevent genocide.  In this regard, it is notable that the Constitutive Act of the African Union expressly endorses the right of the AU to intervene in a member state in respect of grave circumstances, including genocide.  In addition, the 2005 World Summit of the United Nations acknowledged that the international community has a responsibility to protect against genocide, while nonetheless recognising that each State bears the most fundamental responsibility to protect its own population against serious crimes of this nature.  This was reaffirmed in 2006 by UN Security Council Resolution 1674.The international community also has a responsibility to ensure that serious crimes, including genocide, do not go unpunished. It was for the purpose of ending impunity for such crimes that the international community, by adopting the Rome Statute, created the International Criminal Court.  Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC, recognising it as an essential means for bringing to justice those responsible for the most serious international crimes.Tackling serious abuses of human rights, including genocide, in Africa are among the most important tasks facing the international community in the 21st century.  These problems have many causes and manifestations, but poverty, inequality and lack of opportunity have all played a significant role.  The risk of such abuses is greatest where political, economic and administrative systems are weak.  Ireland is committed to addressing these underlying problems.  In our dialogue with partners in the EU and the UN, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace, human rights and tolerance.  Africa is, of course, at the heart of Ireland's programme of official development assistance.In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of human rights abuses in general and the crime of genocide in particular African leadership and responsibility are crucial.  This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African states and the African Union to respond to these challenges.  Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to the challenges of poverty, conflict and security stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The priority for the EU and the international community in the Middle East right now must be to continue to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to engage in a viable peace process with the vision of a settlement which will result in two sovereign States, Israel and Palestine, coexisting side by side in peace and security.  The EU fully supports and is actively cooperating with the current US-led mediation efforts aimed at achieving a settlement freeze and resumption of negotiations.  In addition, the EU is also considering what specific measures it can take to buttress and support a solution, when and if an agreement is finally reached.  I feel strongly that it is only through the establishment of a viable independent Palestinian State that the root causes of the conflict can be adequately addressed and I will ensure that the Government will contribute in whatever way it can to help achieve this goal.It is clear that the situation in Gaza remains very serious.  On the humanitarian level, insufficient amounts of aid are reaching the people of the territory.  Recent reports have painted a bleak picture of life in Gaza, with critical shortages of basic supplies and an increasing sense of despair amongst its people.  Israel also continues to largely refuse the entry of raw materials into Gaza, preventing any substantial progress being made towards the reconstruction that is so badly needed following the Israeli military offensive in December 2008 and January 2009.  This status quo is simply not sustainable and I am concerned about the potential for a further deterioration in the situation in Gaza and the spectre of a possible resumption of large scale violence.Fundamentally, the situation can only be reversed by an immediate and unconditional reopening of the territory's crossing points without restrictions on the normal movement of persons and goods.  This is a point that I and other EU colleagues have made repeatedly to the Israeli authorities.  As I have stated many times, I consider the continued blockade of Gaza by Israel to be both morally unacceptable and politically mistaken.  It serves not only to radicalise the people of the territory, but also inflames tensions across the Occupied Palestinian Territories and indeed the Arab world.  It also undermines moderates on both sides while strengthening the hands of extremists.  The blockade of the territory has persisted for too long and must be brought to an end.  I will continue to press this point in any contacts I have with the Israeli authorities.  While it is heartening that some progress is being made towards the resumption of peace negotiations, we simply cannot afford to neglect the situation in Gaza and the effect it has on both its people and the wider peace process.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Ireland, together with its EU partners, attaches great importance to achieving stability in the countries of the Western Balkans.  The December 2007 European Council reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies within the European Union.  Progress on a range of fronts by countries of the region is discussed regularly at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.The European Union's Stabilisation and Association process for South-East Europe aims to bring the countries of the region closer to EU standards and principles.  The process involves the negotiation of Stabilisation and Association Agreements with each of the countries.  The Agreements focus mainly on trade liberalisation in goods and other economic and trade-related issues, political dialogue and cooperation in a range of sectors such as industry, environment and energy.  Agreements have now been signed with all of the countries in the region with the exception of Kosovo.In terms of EU enlargement, Croatia is at an advanced stage in its accession negotiations and hopes to bring them to completion as soon as possible, but it needs to address some outstanding issues, including full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.  The EU continues to work closely with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as it works towards opening EU accession negotiations. In March, elections were held there and in Montenegro.  The conduct of these polls was largely in line with accepted international standards.  On 15 December 2008, Montenegro submitted its application to join the European Union, which the Council has referred to the European Commission for a formal opinion.  Albania, which formally applied to join the EU on 28 April 2009, awaits discussion of its application at the Council.Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to monitor developments in this region closely.  The EU is also providing financial assistance in support of the reform process and the overall development of the Western Balkans, most notably through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA).  This funding has underpinned the strengthening of the rule of law, good governance, judicial and administrative reform and the development of civil society in the countries concerned.  The average annual allocation for the Western Balkans for the period 2007-2011 is approximately €800 million.  This is by far the highest per capita amount provided by the European Commission to any region in the world.In our contribution to EU discussions, Ireland will continue to support the reform process across the Western Balkans as this represents the best way forward for these countries and for the future stability and prosperity of the region as a whole.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The situation in Sudan, in particular the resolution of the ongoing conflict in Darfur, progress in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the humanitarian consequences of the expulsion of thirteen international humanitarian agencies from the country, continue to be the focus of international concern.  Recent months have seen considerable engagement on these issues by the United Nations, by Sudan's regional neighbours through the African Union, by the US Government and by the European Union.The persistence of the conflict in Darfur despite a number of ceasefires and peace agreements, coupled with the ongoing suffering of the people of the region, is a matter of grave concern.  International efforts to bring an end to the conflict are being led by the joint AU-UN chief mediator, Djibril Bassolé, whose work Ireland fully supports.  The "Agreement of Good Will and Confidence Building" was signed in Doha in February by the Sudanese Government and the JEM rebel group.  The AU has established a High Level Panel on Darfur, under the chairmanship of former South African President Thabo Mbeki, which has undertaken four missions to the region and is due to report by the end of this month.  EU Special Representative Torben Brylle has also been active in efforts to bring peace to the region, including current efforts to expand participation in the next round of talks, which will be convened in Doha on 28 September.  Ireland supports progress made on the CPA through renewed international efforts and urges the parties involved in the Doha talks on Darfur to continue their efforts to reach a resolution.The Government remains extremely concerned at the kidnapping in Darfur of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki and is making every possible effort to ensure their safe release.  To this end, I visited Sudan on 6 and 7 of September to discuss with the Sudanese authorities the efforts that are being made to ensure their safe return to their families and to impress upon the Sudanese authorities the serious concern with which the Irish government views the situation.Ireland, in common with the international community, fully supports the complete implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which brought an end to the north-south conflict in Sudan.  There have been some positive developments in implementation in recent months, including the renewed engagement of the US and the ruling on the Abyei region in the Hague.  The two unresolved issues that remain are the census and the referendum; however, there is cautious optimism that these issues can be resolved.  Ireland welcomes the recent progress on the CPA and urges the parties involved to fulfil their outstanding commitments.Ireland has played an important part in the international response to the humanitarian situation in Sudan, providing over €50 million in funding for work in Sudan, including Darfur, since 2006.  Along with our EU partners, we fully support the fundamental role played by the ICC in the promotion of international justice.  Continued progress towards the full implementation of the CPA is imperative to avoid the risk of a destabilisation in Sudan and its impact on the wider region.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	350	In our bilateral contacts with both Israel and the Palestinian authorities, the Government regularly raises human rights issues, including the implications of respective Israeli and Palestinian security policies, and the importance of full compliance with international humanitarian law.  In particular, Ireland and the EU have serious concerns about the practice of administrative detention, whereby Israel holds Palestinians indefinitely without charge or trial. Ireland has been to the fore in ensuring that these concerns are addressed in the EU's political contacts with Israel, including at meetings of the EU-Israel Association Council.  We have also raised this issue in other fora, including at the United Nations.  Last year, through the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review process — a mechanism through which specific human rights concerns can be raised with UN Member States — Ireland specifically asked Israel to review its use of administrative detention.More broadly, both our Representative Office in Ramallah and Embassy in Tel-Aviv closely monitor other issues relating to prisoners' rights.  They do so in cooperation with a number of Palestinian human rights organisations that benefit from Irish Aid funding.  I am especially aware of the difficulties that ordinary Palestinians face in visiting relatives and friends who are held in detention facilities in Israel proper.  Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement and other bureaucratic obstacles can often make these visits extremely difficult to undertake.  The EU-Palestinian Authority Sub-Committee on human rights has addressed this issue in detail and it remains an active and important item on their agenda.  The overall issue of Palestinian prisoners is certainly of significant importance to the peace process and we will continue to follow developments closely.Ireland also regularly discusses with Palestinian interlocutors the importance of full Palestinian compliance with agreed international standards when it comes to treatment of prisoners held in the West Bank.  The fair and proper treatment of prisoners is a hallmark of democratic government and we will continue to encourage the Palestinian authorities to uphold the highest standards in this regard.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.  The IFB, with overall funding for 2009 of €21.8m, continues with its key role of developing and supporting film production in Ireland.  The provision in its current allocation facilitates the IFB in marketing Ireland as a film location and, in particular, in raising the profile of the Irish audio-visual industry abroad.The capital funding provided to the IFB has ensured support to meet the demands of the industry in the areas of project and talent development, training and indigenous film and television production and enables the IFB to fulfil its aim of sustained growth of the industry — increasing the number and quality of films produced in Ireland each year.In tandem with supports from the IFB, my Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the Section 481 tax relief scheme.  This scheme is kept under regular review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any enhancements necessary to retain or regain competitiveness are addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate.  The scheme was amended and enhanced in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and most recently in 2008.  The amendments in 2008 extended the scheme for a further four years until the end of 2012, increased the overall ceiling on qualifying expenditure from €35m to €50m, increased the individual investor cap for those wishing to invest finance in film in Ireland under Section 481 to €50,000 per annum from the previous limit of €31,750 and increased the relief on that investment to 100% from 80%.  Approval from the European Commission to introduce these changes was secured in March and the Minister for Finance subsequently signed the Commencement Orders on 16 March.  Clearly, this shows a long-term commitment by the Government to the Irish audiovisual industry.I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be articulating the benefits to Ireland of having a vibrant film industry and that the proposals in the Report of Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (McCarthy Report) have not been adopted by the Government as policy but will be considered in the context of the 2010 estimates debate.

The FSA budget for 2009 is €35.707 million.  The Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme is operated by the Family Support Agency. There are currently 107 Family Resource Centres (FRCs) nationwide. The total budget for the FRC Programme in 2009 is over €18m.The aim of this Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The emphasis in Family Resource Centres is on the involvement of the local community in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned. FRCs assess the needs of their local communities and ensure that there are services and supports in place to address these needs. They involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made a range of recommendations relating to the Department of Social and Family Affairs including recommendations relating to the Family Support Agency and its programmes.   The Department will consider, as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010, the Report’s recommendations and decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for Government. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The unprecedented increase in the claimload at the Clondalkin office in the past 18 months (claimload increased by 8,825) has put a lot of extra pressure on the service at the office. The office has limited public space and counter space is very restricted.  Urgent efforts continue to be made to reduce queuing times and to alleviate congestion both outside the building and on the public floor. The office opens at 9.30 a.m. and the opening hours have been extended at lunchtime to provide more access for customers. Extra seating was provided recently in the public area and additional signing sessions have been arranged to alleviate congestion on signing days.The office is scheduled to undergo significant renovations in November 2009. New interview rooms and additional public floor space with seating will be provided on the first floor. These renovations will also facilitate the introduction of an appointment system for customers making new or repeat claims. These customers will be given a designated time, date and hatch to have their application processed.  The Department is also giving priority to the provision of a local office in Lucan and efforts are ongoing to secure suitable accommodation there. Some 30% of the claimload at the Clondalkin office is from the Lucan area and the provision of a local office in Lucan will greatly relieve the congestion problems in Clondalkin.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  The legislative provisions for Disability Allowance are contained in Parts 1 and 3 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, and the Rules regarding the calculation of means are contained in Schedule 3 of that Act.The person concerned applied for a Disability Allowance on 24 March 1998.  He did not disclose any means and he stated on his application form that he had no property other than his own home. Based on the information provided by him he was awarded Disability Allowance with effect from 1 April 1998 at the maximum rate.  His claim was reviewed by a Social Welfare Inspector on 4 October 1999 and he did not disclose any means and his Disability Allowance remained in payment at the maximum rate.  The person concerned died on 2 December 2007 and the Solicitor dealing with his Estate forwarded a Schedule of his Assets to the Department. Under Section 339(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 the Personal Representatives are legally obliged to furnish this information. The Personal Representatives in this case are the daughter and son of the deceased person.Following an investigation of the assets held by the person concerned it was found that he had land which he had not disclosed when he applied for Disability Allowance or when his claim was subsequently reviewed in 1999. As this land was owned and not occupied the capital value of the property is assessable as means.  On 3 October 2008 a Deciding Officer reassessed the means of the person concerned taking account of the value of the undisclosed property and decided that he had no entitlement to Disability Allowance from 3 April 1998 to 30 November 2007 as his means exceeded the then limits for receipt of the allowance. The Personal Representatives were notified of this decision and of their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. They were also informed that arising from this decision a total of €63,597 Disability Allowance was paid to the person concerned to which he had no entitlement and that this amount is recoverable from the Estate under Section 335(b) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.The decision was appealed on 15th October 2008. The Appeals Officer upheld the Deciding Officer's decision that the person concerned was not entitled to Disability Allowance and a letter informing the Personal Representatives of this decision was issued by the Appeals Office on 24 June 2009.  No new relevant information has been supplied and therefore there is no change to the amount due from the Estate.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income below standard levels.Self-employed people may receive a back to school clothing and footwear allowance, provided they are receiving a qualifying social welfare or HSE payment or participating in approved employment or education/training and satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the scheme.  Any changes to the qualifying criteria of the scheme would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.

As regards delays in finalising appeals, I am advised that the average time taken in 2008 to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those average processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.There has been an increase of 32% in the number of appeals received so far this year compared to last year and, having regard to the current volume of appeals awaiting determination, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office earlier this year.  Furthermore, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

Arising from this, an additional 40 Inspectors are being assigned.  In addition, a number of process improvement initiatives have been introduced in Local Offices recently which will also improve processing times.  These include:a system which involves dealing with customers by appointment and deciding claims, where possible, when the customer attends for their appointment.  This initiative has greatly reduced processing times for a significant number of customers and will be in operation in 20 local offices by the end of this month.  It is intended to extend this system to other offices over the coming months.a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires anda streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years.The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible. All aspects of claim processing are kept under constant review and improvements are implemented on a continuous basis.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I am aware of the views of the Irish Campaign against Blood Sports in connection with hare coursing. Hare coursing in the State is administered by the Irish Coursing Club, a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  Statutory responsibility for the Act is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species.    Where a hunting licence under the Wildlife Act 1976 is required, each licence application is dealt with individually having regard to the conservation impact on the particular species in line with the provisions of the Act.  My Department recently issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club allowing its affiliated clubs to tag and net hares for the purpose of hare coursing for the 2009/2010 season subject to certain conditions.There is no current evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations and the decision to issue these licences took into consideration the report of the Status of Hares in Ireland — Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07.   The survey showed that the Irish hare is widespread, occurring throughout the entire country. However, population densities for the Irish hare were found to be highly variable and it seems that populations can rapidly increase and decrease in a short space of time.  The Irish Hare is listed in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).  Under Article 17 of the Directive Member States are obliged to report to the European Commission on the status of listed habitats and species every six years. In December 2007, Ireland submitted the first baseline assessments of conservation status for all 59 habitats and some 100 species that occur in Ireland.Each species was assessed according to its range across Ireland, the population, the quality of its habitat and its future prospects.  The reporting template requires the results of the assessment to be expressed as good, inadequate or bad status.  The range and future prospects of the Hare were considered favourable.  As the extent of population fluctuation between years is not yet understood, it was not possible to identify a specific favourable reference value for population, resulting in an "unknown" response to this assessment category.  The habitat was assessed as inadequate because there had been some loss due to urbanisation and agricultural intensification. Although only one assessment category reported an inadequate result the rules of the reporting methodology require that the overall summary position must then be described as inadequate. However, the species is not regarded as endangered within the meaning of the Habitats Directive.

A record 17,000 applications were received up to the closing date of 15 May for 2009, and further applications were received up to the time the Scheme closed.  The latter will be processed as applications for 2010.  Payments due to REPS farmers for 2009 will be the highest ever.  All participants already in REPS will continue to receive annual payments until their current contracts run their course.I plan to introduce a new agri-environment scheme in 2010 which will reduce compliance costs to participants and which will provide a menu of targeted actions from which farmers may choose.  Funding for the new scheme will include the additional modulation funds which I ensured will be retained for the benefit of Irish farmers in the negotiations on the CAP "Health Check".  It will also include additional matching Exchequer funding.The new scheme requires the approval of the European Commission.  An outline has already been sent to the Commission as part of a set of proposals for an amended Rural Development Programme following a consultation exercise on the use of the modulation funds.  The details of the scheme have yet to be finalised.  I invited submissions from stakeholders, the closing date for which was 4 September and the submissions received are now being examined and considered in my Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	376	On 15th July, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department's Local Office Network.  The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future.  This will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department.  While this will yield significant savings for the exchequer, no staff will be made redundant.In terms of the offices selected for enhancement as a regional office or selected for closure, no one single criterion was used.  Rather each decision was based on a combination of criteria including geographical spread, ownership of building, standard of accommodation, staff availability, opportunities for staff redeployment, potential alternative use for buildings and caseload/demand for services.  The decisions on which offices to enhance and which to close were not based on the performance of any office or staff, rather decisions as outlined above were made in relation to the overall strategy.  The Department is currently in discussion with other departments in relation to the redeployment of staff and transfer of buildings.

I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a MGLD.Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class.  This minimum was not fulfilled in six schools in the area referred to by the Deputy and therefore the schools no longer qualify to retain the six classes concerned.  These special classes which have closed pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.All children with MGLD who were in the classes that have been suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model.  Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature.  My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.The Deputy will be aware that my Department's policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system.  In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs.  The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer for North Tipperary has advised that an application for school transport has not been received for the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied.  The family of the pupil concerned should liaise with the Transport Liaison Office for North Tipperary regarding school transport provision.

Each year, the scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for grants purposes. The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions.  I understand the course referred to by the Deputy is provided by a private college which is not approved for grants purposes. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to such private colleges.  Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from the candidate's local tax office.

At the meeting on 4 June, the Taoiseach conveyed the views of the Government and this House, that further substantial contributions are required by way of  reparation and that these contributions need to be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the context of the costs of well over a billion euro incurred by the State.   At the meeting and subsequently in a press release, the congregations indicated their willingness to make further contributions.At the subsequent meeting on 24 June, the congregations reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial positions. The Taoiseach indicated that the Government would appoint a panel of three independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.The appointment of the three person panel by the Government to examine these statements was announced on 28 July. All of the congregations have submitted their statements and I understand that the Panel is well advanced in its work and expects to be in a position to report before the end of October. It is intended that the conclusions of the panel will be made public.  In its statement announcing the membership of the Panel, the Government indicated that while the Panel is carrying out its work, it expected that the congregations would be working to produce an offer of a substantial contribution by way of reparation for the suffering of children in residential institutions. The statement was circulated to the leaders of all the congregations and their attention was specifically drawn to this aspect of it.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.  This information has been circulated to all existing school Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of  existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required.  The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.Forward Planning Section is now in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.  When the detailed reports are completed for these initial areas identified the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.

The planning and Building Unit of my Department is working closely with the school authority to ensure that the transfer to this accommodation is as smooth as possible.  With regard to the school's application for a new building, this, in common with all such applications, has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.

The construction of a new headquarters building in Mullingar for the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with a new headquarters for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and a new decentralised office for staff of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Employment in Carlow was one of the projects given priority status.The proposed decentralised offices in the above three locations are being procured by means of a Public Private Partnership as a single Design, Build, Finance and Maintain contract.  Planning permissions have been received for the three buildings, and discussions are proceeding with the successful tenderer with a view to finalising financial closure and contract signing, subject to Government approval.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	390	My Department provides grant aid, under the home tuition scheme, to parents of children with autism who are awaiting an educational placement or to provide early education intervention for pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism. The grant provides for ten hours home tuition per week for each child with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age.  This increases to twenty hours per week on the child's 3rd birthday.  No funding is provided in respect of children with autism who have a school/early education placement available to them.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  The Deputy will also be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department's circulars for allocating such support.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  Combined classes are a feature of the majority of schools in the country and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.In terms of class sizes 80% of primary pupils were in classes of less than 30 pupils during the last school year.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will inevitably be differences in individual class sizes.  Some schools can have class sizes of greater than 28 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes.Where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.  In general, the view of my Department is that, where combined classes are formed, mixed-ability classes are preferable and my Department recommends random selection as a fair and educationally sound approach to the assignment of pupils to such classes.It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was originally established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria for appeal of mainstream staffing are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009 which is available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	392	In light of the Budget 2009 decision in relation to language support my Department has published a circular for schools which sets out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers from September 2009. The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation measures that were announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils. The alleviation measures mean that these schools can qualify for up to 4 language support posts with the possibility of additional posts also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism. Schools can now apply to my Department in the normal way for language support posts. These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support. It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be circa 1,500 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-17 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.I wish to reassure the Deputy that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  The Deputy will be aware that I have met with representatives of both the Church of Ireland Board of Education and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to discuss the funding position of Protestant schools and the background to the decision in the October budget to remove certain grants from fee-charging Protestant schools.I have emphasised that no changes have been made to the block grant, which is expected to be €6.5 million in this school year. It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  I wish to advise the Deputy that my officials have met representatives from the Secondary Education Committee to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools.  In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas.The October Budget implemented changes in how all fee-charging schools are treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated. With effect from 1 January 2009, teachers in fee-charging schools are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools.  In view of the challenging economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure. Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.  I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The circular in question predates the establishment of the NCSE which now has responsibility for deciding on the quantum of resource teaching and/or care supports to be allocated to individual schools to enable them to meet the needs of enrolled pupils with special educational needs.  However, professional reports are provided as part of any application process for support.  These should identify the frequency and extent of the child's care needs arising from the diagnosed disability. The SENO takes these reports into account along with other relevant factors such as the existing level of SNA support in a school when determining the level of SNA support sanctioned to a school.

The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

SENOs are deployed by the NCSE throughout the State to provide a nationwide service. Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs. The office location of each SENO is set out in the attachment and may also be accessed through www.ncse.ie.

Responsibility for the appropriate supervision of students is therefore a matter for the individual Board of Management.  While the Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision in the specific situations outlined by the Deputy, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the individual circumstances, including the age of the pupil.The question of the degree of supervision required in situations where pupils are attending sports events, school tours and other events outside of the school grounds, is a matter for determination by the Board of Management having regard to all the relevant circumstances concerned.
