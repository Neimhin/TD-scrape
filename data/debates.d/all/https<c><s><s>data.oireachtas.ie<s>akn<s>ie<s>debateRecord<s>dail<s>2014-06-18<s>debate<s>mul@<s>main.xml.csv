There have been three separate reports into this tragic accident. The air accident investigation unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport conducted an inquiry and published its report on 24 January 2012. A coroner’s inquest was held in May 2012 into the deaths of the two crew members. The third investigation was a military court of inquiry which was convened on 26 July 2012 and produced its report on 17 January 2013. The findings of the court of inquiry are consistent with earlier investigations held by the air accident investigation unit and the coroner’s inquest, namely, that the probable cause of the accident was the spatial disorientation of the instructor who was piloting the aircraft in conditions of poor visibility at the time. It is agreed in all of the reports that the cadet bore no responsibility of any kind for the accident. As the convening authority, the Chief of Staff has indicated that he is in agreement with the proceedings and findings of the court of inquiry and that it complied with the terms of reference set. Defence Forces regulations provide for military courts of inquiry. A court of inquiry may be convened to investigate any issue affecting military personnel, equipment or property which a convening authority considers necessary to have investigated. The primary duty and responsibility of a court of inquiry is to ascertain the truth concerning the matter under investigation. The members of a court of inquiry shall be held responsible for failing to report any irregularity coming to their notice in the course of their investigations. The findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry are confidential, in accordance with Defence Forces regulations. The Minister has discretion to direct that the full court of inquiry report be made available to interested parties. In this instance, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, provided the families with a copy of the report of the court of inquiry. The Chief of Staff, in the context of the report of the court of inquiry and in accordance with the provisions of Defence Forces regulations, can add any comments, criticisms or other remarks which, in his or her opinion, are relevant to the matter under investigation. The former Minister for Defence received a series of correspondence from the family in which allegations were made in respect of a wide range of issues to do with this tragic accident, including the conduct of the court of inquiry. Legal advice was sought from the Attorney General, and the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, having considered the matters in the context of that legal advice, was satisfied that further investigation into any issues relating to this tragic accident was not warranted.The family was informed accordingly. I have met the family on a number of occasions, as they are from my constituency. The previous Minister and officials from the Department also met the family to afford them the opportunity to discuss their concerns. At the most recent meeting between the family and both the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff on 6 June last, an approach to address concerns raised by the family was discussed. This matter is currently being progressed following the meeting. In this context the Taoiseach, in his role as Minister for Defence, has not arranged to meet the family. I would like to once again extend my sympathies to the families of the deceased.

He will be aware that the Jevens family has grave concerns about a multiplicity of matters surrounding the court of inquiry. They understand it was the third of three inquiries held into the accident but in numerous correspondences they raised serious issues relating to what they see, and which appear to be, significant breaches of military regulation. However, my clear understanding from them is that when they last met the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department in recent weeks, they were given an undertaking that the court of inquiry report, which they had previously understood to have been signed off on by the previous Chief of Staff but which had not been, would be the subject of an addendum by the current Chief of Staff that would take into account concerns the family had about evidence given by a civilian witness and a then serving member of the Defence Forces.

It is important to note that the court of inquiry is not being reopened, a point made to the Jevens family and confirmed by the previous Minister following legal advice that there had been three separate investigations into this tragic accident and that a further investigation was not warranted. That remains the case and has been communicated to the family. The Chief of Staff in the context of the court of inquiry, and in accordance with provisions in Defence Forces regulations, can add any comments, criticisms or other remarks which in his opinion are relevant to the matter under investigation. This matter is being progressed and will be communicated to the relevant parties in due course. The Deputy stated the family was told by an official that the court of inquiry report had been signed off. While the inquiry had been completed, it was not signed off on because the family had submitted correspondence raising issues regarding the court of inquiry. That is the reason the previous Chief of Staff did not sign off on the report.

He must be aware that there are serious concerns about a number of the contributions to the court of inquiry and there will have to be an addendum to the report with amendments. The record has to be corrected and that is the very least the family can expect. It is also my understanding that the Information Commissioner has agreed that the documentation withheld by the Chief of Staff from the inquiry should be released. Will the Minister of State ensure his decision is not appealed by the Defence Forces? An eight week period is provided for before the documents are handed over. Will he allow that to happen as a demonstration of goodwill in this matter?

The findings and recommendations of all courts of inquiry are confidential in accordance with Defence Forces regulations. The family received a copy and the Minister has discretion to direct the full court of inquiry report to be made available to interested parties and, in this instance, the former Minister provided the family with a copy of the report. Following on from that, he received a series of correspondence from the family in which allegations were made in respect of a wide range of issues relating to the tragic accident, including the conduct of the court of inquiry. Legal advice had to be sought from the Attorney General and the former Minister, having considered the matters in the context of the advice, was satisfied that a further investigation was not warranted into any issue relating to the tragic accident. The family was informed accordingly. A number of meetings were then held with the family at which their concerns were discussed. The Deputy will appreciate, given the sensitivities involved in such circumstances and the requirement to obtain legal advice, that the matter has taken some time to progress.

Will he also confirm when the report will issue with the agreed addendum? This will satisfy the family to some extent in so far as it will put on the public record their concerns about the reputation of their son, which, as the Minister of State said, is and should be untarnished by any suggestion that he had any responsibility in respect of the accident. Can he make that crystal clear to the House? I pose the question, notwithstanding the fact the family has raised a number of other serious concerns about breaches of military protocol and military regulations which arose during this case.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	Will the Minister of State also confirm, which he did not during the previous opportunity he was given, that the Information Commissioner has ruled that documents withheld by the previous Chief of Staff from the court of inquiry should be released and that the Department will not appeal the decision and will release the documents? This family has been through enough. It would be good to say that they will get the documents and, as Deputy Ó Fearghaíl said, that the addendum will be attached and the record will be corrected as necessary.

I have just taken over responsibilities in this area and, therefore, I will get back to the Deputy about his question in correspondence. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl is correct that all reports agree that the cadet bore no responsibility for this accident and he is correct about the meeting between the family and the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff on 6 June. The Department and the military will be in contact with the Jevens family on the proposals made by both gentlemen.

It was my understanding that, following that meeting, the family was content with some of the commitments given by both the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff. Those are being progressed.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	This is an issue that we discussed with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, on his last appearance here, where he told us that nobody in the Curragh would be rendered homeless and that the Department would engage with people there in order to look at alternative accommodation for them, yet, in the past two weeks, three eviction notices were served on residents there, including on a number of quite ill citizens. Will the Minister agree to honour the previous commitments made to engage with the residents to discuss so-called "overholding" in the Curragh?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I thank Deputy Daly for her question. As has been said previously, military personnel are obliged under Defence Forces regulations to vacate married quarters within 21 days of retiring or being discharged from military service. The term "overholder" is used to describe former members of the Defence Forces and their families who have refused to leave married quarters when obliged to do so. The situation of overholders continuing to occupy married quarters is no longer sustainable and measures to resolve this are being progressed. Properties located outside barracks are offered for sale to the occupants. Those located within barracks are not for sale, as the property is required to be retained for future military use and for security reasons. My Department is, therefore, in accordance with normal procedures, seeking vacant possession of married quarters which are being overheld and will continue to do so until the overholding issue is resolved. Any initiative to resolve overholding must support and complement the current policy which dates back to 1997 of withdrawing from the provision of married quarters.  In the period since January 2013, some 12 properties which were being overheld in the area of the Curragh Camp have been returned by the occupants. There are 28 overholders remaining at the camp. This represents a small group in relation to the large number of military personnel who occupied such quarters over the years but who returned the properties to the Department on their retirement, as they were required to do. Ten of the current group of overholders do not pay charges in respect of their use of the property, including in some cases charges for the use of electricity. Of the remaining overholder cases at the camp, the Department is aware that a small number of occupants may be particularly vulnerable due to their personal circumstances. In light of this, the Department has been examining what assistance it might provide in order to bring about a resolution. My officials will contact these individuals once the range of options open to the Department is determined. It is preferable not to have to use legal means to obtain vacant possession of the properties concerned. However, the ongoing illegal occupation of military property by those who have no entitlement to do so cannot be supported. It is important to remember also that the Department of Defence does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for former members of the Defence Forces or for the general public.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	The Minister's response is wholly inadequate. He has just rehashed information that has been given in this House many times and did not deal with the question. Events have moved on since the mantra that the Minister read out to us previously and there have been developments on the ground. Deputy Wallace and I met the property management section at the Curragh Camp a number of months ago. The residents also met representatives this week. The Minister has not addressed the fact that, in the intervening period, the Department of Defence has seen fit to issue eviction notices to a number of other people, which goes completely against what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said previously. He said that nobody would be rendered homeless on the basis of the manner in which the Department dealt with those issues. He acknowledged that there were a number of elderly and vulnerable citizens there. The Minister's actions contradict that.  The group which met the Department on Friday put forward the suggestion that O'Higgins Terrace might be renovated. That is an order which could be handed over to the county council because of where the terrace is situated in the camp. There was a suggestion that this would be given active consideration. Can the Minister confirm that is the case and that he will, as he said he wanted to, withdraw from legal proceedings in the meantime?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	A number of people who are in residence in the married quarters are vulnerable and the Department will examine their circumstances on a case-by-case basis. It is fine to live in the married quarters when one is a soldier, but it has always been the case that once one has retired from the Defence Forces, one vacates those premises. People have been under no illusions over the past number of years of the terms and conditions involved. The Department pays the property tax in respect of each house occupied by the overholder. Overholders do not have to pay for their bin collections. Bins are collected by the Defence Forces under the general bin collection contract to the Curragh. Some overholders do not even have to pay for their electricity. Deputies here represent struggling people in their own constituencies, yet there are people in the camp who do not have to pay property tax nor pay for their bin collections and electricity.  A number of legal proceedings have been commenced and they will continue.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The Minister's comments are derogatory and inaccurate and he has not moved on with developments. It was agreed with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, that there would be a technical assessment of the properties in the Curragh Camp. A limited technical assessment was done on Pearse Terrace. I would like to see the outcome of that, because, on the information which the Minister, Deputy Shatter, gave us, it is possible to renovate some of those dwellings for accommodation use, which in the current climate of a housing crisis is something that everybody should be concerned about. The Minister said that he was looking at the circumstances of some residents on a case-by-case basis but then slandered everybody who lives there and tried to make out that none of them pays their bills. I put it to him that Department officials met residents on Friday and discussed the possibility of renovating O'Higgins Terrace. If he is saying that no one will be made homeless and that vulnerable people are there, what alternatives is he putting in place to deal with that? Is the O'Higgins Terrace proposition being considered? In the meantime, will he withdraw from legal proceedings and discuss this matter rationally with the families and individuals who served this State so loyally as members of the Defence Forces over the years?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	We will not withdraw from any legal proceedings and those will continue, because this situation has been going on for quite some time. It is my Department's policy to review each overholder's situation on a case-by-case basis. As each case is different, I cannot pre-empt how overholders that the Deputy has grouped together will be dealt with. As I have already mentioned, both the cost of renovation of the properties and the security issues surrounding civilian occupation of quarters within the military barracks present problems which are difficult to overcome. However, I have taken the Deputy's views on board. There has been a huge amount of consultation between the Department and the residents in the Curragh. Numerous meetings have taken place over quite some time and I understand that Deputies from all sides of the House have been in contact with the Department raising the concerns of some of the residents there. This question goes back to the fact that it has always been a condition that when one retires from the Defence Forces, one is no longer a resident or entitled to a house. That has been the case and it has never been hidden from any member of the Defence Forces who had the right to a property.

Recently, there is renewed speculation about the LE Eithne amid reports that up to 150 military and civilian personnel may have been impacted or exposed to the asbestos material. We seek to establish the position from the Minister of State.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	At the outset I would like to assure the Deputy that the safety and well-being of all individuals involved in the Naval Base is of primary concern. I am advised by the Naval Service that it is following all Health and Safety Authority, HSA, guidelines while dealing with the current situation. Earlier this year while work was being carried out on both LE Orla and LE Ciara material which was suspected as being asbestos was found on both ships. Both Cork Dockyard Ltd. and the Naval Service called in external expertise to carry out a full survey and analysis of the ships which confirmed that the material was asbestos - a particular type of white asbestos called chrysotile.  The Naval Service contacted the HSA and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The HSA has launched its own investigation into the incident and this is ongoing. I am advised that the HSA has visited the Naval Base a number of times and has served the Naval Service with an improvement notice under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. All staff on board LE Ciara, LE Orla and in the Naval Service dockyard, including the civilian workforce, have been briefed on the situation to date. All Naval Service personnel who may have come into contact with asbestos have been screened by the Naval Medical Officer. Medical screening of civilian employees by an occupational health practitioner has commenced and will be completed in the coming weeks. Since the discovery of asbestos, air sampling and monitoring has been conducted by an external contractor on both ships and in the transport workshops and the samples taken were found to be safe. As part of the requirements under the HSA improvement notice, the Naval Service has engaged an external company, Abestaways, who are specialists in asbestos removals, to undertake the deep "environmental clean" of the two ships. This clean-up commenced on 26 May and is estimated to take a number of weeks. On completion of this process an independent asbestos consultancy company, Phoenix Environmental, will carry out air monitoring, analysis and third party assurance and reissue a re-occupational certificate as required by the HSA. I am advised by the Naval Service that a full asbestos audit of all ships in the fleet will be carried out and in the interim a full asbestos risk assessment will be carried out prior to any work commencing. As I mentioned previously, this matter is being treated with the utmost seriousness and attention by the Department of Defence and the Naval Service. The Naval Service will be launching a formal accident investigation team to investigate all aspects behind this occurrence and to ensure that there is no repetition in the future. I understand that the HSA investigation is likely to take some time to complete. The Department will ensure that any recommendations emanating from the HSA findings will be acted upon immediately.

Will he further confirm that consultants were engaged previously by the Naval Service to assess the fleet and that the consultancy found that asbestos was not a problem aboard these vessels? The Minister tells us there has been screening of those who potentially may have been exposed to the asbestos, asbestos dust being the major difficulty. What arrangements has his Department put in place to ensure there is ongoing screening of people so exposed because there is a risk for people exposed to asbestos that they will develop pleural plaques? As we know, that can lead to the development of asbestosis, which is a particularly nasty condition to say the least.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The Deputy asked about the fleet and the operational duties. The Naval Service is currently operating with six ships, which is 75% of allocated resources. It is inevitable that a lower level of operational output will continue over the coming months until the fleet is fully operational again. Where the Naval Service would on occasion visit harbours, specifically over the summer months, that has been curtailed and the remaining vessels put into operational duty because some of the vessels are tied up for examination. The Deputy referred to personnel. All staff aboard the LE Ciara and the LE Orla and those in the Naval Service dockyard, including the civilian workforce, have been briefed on the position to date. All Naval Service personnel who have come into contact with asbestos have been screened by the Naval Medical Officer. In addition, health surveillance is being offered to all staff in accordance with regulations. Medical screening of civilian employees by an occupational health practitioner has been offered in accordance with regulations to all staff. Medical screening of civilian employees by an occupational health practitioner has commenced and will be completed in the coming weeks. An occupational health practitioner in asbestos has been briefed also. I assure the Deputy that this medical screening will be continued if needs be to make sure there are no dangers in place for staff.

The Minister has not clarified the position on the LE Eithne. Is it tied up as a result of concerns about asbestos in her forward pump room? Also, can the Minister tell us if it is the case that consultants in the area of asbestos were brought in by the Minister's Department and the Naval Service, that they examined these ships and told the Naval Service that everything was fine? If such consultants did so report, what will his Department do about that? The Minister listed at least two other consultancies that he intends bringing into play in this process but if a previous consultant gave inaccurate and erroneous advice, what is to be done about them?

Off the top of my head I cannot tell the Deputy the year but I am almost sure, and I can revert to him by way of correspondence, that consultancy is no longer in business.

It could have been early 2000 or a little later, but I am not certain on the date. The Deputy asked me about the LE Aoife-----

By way of a brief reminder, on 27 April 1981, in Dyar Ntar, a village in south Lebanon, two privates in our Defence Forces, Hugh Doherty and Kevin Joyce, were killed by unknown forces at that time. The body of Private Kevin Joyce was never recovered and returned to his family. Private Hugh Doherty is from Letterkenny, in my constituency. I have met his family and members of the Defence Forces who served that day. There is a commitment to meet with them and I ask the Minister when that will happen.

The case to which the Deputy refers relates back to April 1981 in Lebanon when a UN observation post manned by Private Hugh Doherty and Private Kevin Joyce came under attack. Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing. Some equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown. Earlier this year during parliamentary questions the then Minister for Defence indicated that he had received a request from the Doherty family for a meeting.Officials of the Department of Defence intend to meet members of the Doherty family in the first instance, at a mutually convenient time and date, to gain a clear understanding of their concerns. In this regard, the Department of Defence has been in contact with the family and they are aware of the current position regarding a future meeting. I understand officials have been in contact in the past 24 hours because I specifically asked them to make contact. It is important that we have dialogue with the families involved, and specifically in this case.

When I met the family, I also met a number of members of the Defence Forces who served in Lebanon at that time. They have a detailed understanding of the issues involved in terms of the initial investigation by Colonel Savino. The colonel did not interview any of the team on the ground, bullet casings went missing and there were issues regarding the isolated nature of the observation post. There are a number of issues that the family, as lay people like me, do not understand. It would be only fair to the family if two members of the Defence Forces who served on that day would also be permitted to attend so the meeting can be constructive. Indeed, as I suggested previously, they would be happy to submit an agenda to the Minister and his departmental staff in advance of the meeting so they can see and prepare for the issues they intend to raise. Will the Minister allow two members of the Defence Forces who were there that day to accompany the family? It would assist in making the meeting constructive. I know the Minister wishes to get the answers as to what happened as much as anybody else.

My Department's officials can consider any requests from the family. This week, both the Lebanese authorities and the UNIFIL personnel were made aware of the Irish Government's desire for closure for the family of Private Joyce. During a visit last Monday with me to Lebanon, the Taoiseach asked for the assistance of the Lebanese authorities. He also raised the murders of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne while noting that the alleged perpetrator is currently living in the United States. Irish officials are in close contact with the authorities in this regard. The Taoiseach stated there was a clear need for closure and for the alleged perpetrators to be brought to justice. He sought the support of the Lebanese authorities. We will tease out further the contribution the Taoiseach made during his recent visit to Lebanon with the Lebanese authorities.

That will be immensely helpful to the family. I appreciate that if that is what the Minister has agreed. Second, and this is an issue on which I will probably follow up in correspondence, there were ongoing efforts over the years to try to engage with the authorities in Lebanon and with the Palestinian authorities to see if they could assist in locating the body of Private Joyce. There was an initiative in 2001 in which Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, representatives met the then Minister for the Displaced in Lebanon, Marwan Hamadeh. He is still alive and is a very much respected figure. Would there be some benefit in asking our Defence Forces representatives to re-engage with them? I appreciate that it is an extremely difficult and challenging task after all these years, but I can assist with any re-engagement in terms of the personnel who met the Minister at that time. He appeared to take a great interest and to wish to pursue the matter vigorously.

To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce. However, I am advised by the military authorities that even though it is now 33 years since this tragic event happened, the case remains open and efforts are made from time to time in Lebanon to establish the location of Private Joyce's remains. If located, efforts will be made to repatriate them. The Department of Defence will continue to make every effort to bring this tragic case to a conclusion. I will take on board the Deputy's comments and will talk to the officials who are dealing with the Joyce family to ensure that every assistance is given to them. If anybody has any information about this case, I ask them to come forward.

Will the Irish Defence Forces be participating in commemorative events and, if so, will the Minister outline those events?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The development of the commemorative programme for the centenary period, to include the First World War, is being co-ordinated on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan. I understand that arrangements to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War are at an advanced stage and officials from the Department of Defence are liaising closely with colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in supporting commemorative events in Ireland and abroad. In common with the many nations who share the history of the First World War, it is appropriate that we acknowledge the service and loss of Irish soldiers in that conflict. This was reflected in the significant support that the Defence Forces provided in Messines in December 2013 when the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister laid wreaths in remembrance of the Irish who lost their lives in the First World War. The Defence Forces have been active in acknowledging service and loss for many years. They already play a central role in the annual commemorations at the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge and in the National Day of Commemoration ceremony in Kilmainham and will do so again this year, in July. Furthermore, on 31 July next, a Cross of Sacrifice will be unveiled in Glasnevin Cemetery which will be dedicated to the Irish soldiers who died in the First World War. The Defence Forces will provide significant ceremonial and logistical support for this event. Members of the Defence Forces will also attend First World War commemorations being held across Europe, including the Somme ceremony in July and centenary commemorations marking the start of the war in early August. In addition to the support and representation provided at national and international commemorations to mark the First World War, requests for Defence Forces participation in events organised by local authorities and community groups are also received and, where appropriate, representation is provided.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I welcome the involvement of the Defence Forces in the commemoration of the First World War as we approach the centenary on 28 July. I acknowledge the sacrifice of 754 men from Galway and 720 men from Mayo who died in that conflict. It is only in recent years that there has been an attempt to remember the sacrifice that was made and the different reasons people fought, including for the rights of small nations following the invasion in Belgium. The Minister mentioned the peace park in Messines and I was delighted to be able to visit it a number of years ago. There is also a nice exhibition in Galway City Museum. It is a poignant tribute to those who died and fought in the war. The Minister mentioned the events planned and I have looked at a number of the websites, including the decade of centenaries website and the websites of the Department of Defence and the Irish Defence Forces. I am not saying there is nothing on the Defence Forces website, but it is hard to find it. There should be some acknowledgement of the events. Also, on the decade of centenaries website, the First World War section is blank. The home page provides a list of what has happened over the past number of months but little information on what is planned. The Minister might be able to ask his Department and the other Department to examine that.

Like him, I recognise the great sacrifices made by a significant number of people across our small country during wartime. I assure him that the Department of Defence will assist in any commemoration with which it is asked to be involved, and not only in Ireland, as seen earlier this year alongside the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	There are four such barracks. One has been sold and another is in the process of being sold, but considerable money has been expended on them. My question relates to the remaining two barracks, in respect of which approximately €500,000 has been spent on security, etc. Could we put them to more productive uses?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I thank the Deputy for her question. During the term of this Government, four barracks have been closed: Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, O'Neill Barracks in Cavan, Columb Barracks in Mullingar and Mitchell Barracks in Castlebar. The closures were effective from March 2012. Agreement in principle has been reached on the sale of Kickham Barracks to Tipperary County Council. The council is developing a masterplan for the entire barracks in consultation with some State bodies that have expressed an interest in the site. O'Neill Barracks in Cavan was sold in 2013 to the then County Cavan Vocational Education Committee and is being used for educational purposes. Columb Barracks in Mullingar remains the property of the Department of Defence and is being used by the Garda and the Customs Service for training purposes. A large part of the barracks has been leased to the Westmeath GAA board for use as a potential centre of excellence. Mitchell Barracks in Castlebar has been sold to Mayo County Council. That sale is expected to close in the coming months. The Deputy will appreciate that many of the former barracks are or will be used for community, educational and sporting purposes.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I am aware of that, but I am also aware that well over €500,000 had been spent on security. While some movement has occurred, it is not enough in the case of Columb Barracks. We could do much more. The idea of using the barracks as a national emergency training centre has been raised. It is not true to say that it is being utilised. The Reserve Defence Force unit is renting premises at a cost to the Department of Defence of approximately €30,000, Westmeath Civil Defence operates from leaky prefabs in another area and the Garda uses the shooting range, but none of this is enough. Will the Minister of State consider developing the site as a national emergency training centre? All of the State's organisations could use it, the local Reserve Defence Force unit could act as its staff, training could be undertaken during the summer, a crash training centre of excellence could be developed there and it could be used for water rescue training as well as rail disaster training, given its proximity to a disused railway. There is also an airfield. I would like the Minister of State to consider this suggestion as a better use of funds.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	Following the closure of the barracks, the Department invited Departments and other public bodies to express an interest in the property. None did. In the meantime, a one year lease was signed with the Westmeath GAA county board for the use of part of the former barracks as a centre of excellence for the development of Gaelic games in the county. Subsequently, agreement has been reached in principle on a long-term lease by the board for the whole of the barracks. This will be put in place shortly. The barracks is also being used for training purposes by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners' specialist dog unit. I am unsure of whether there will be space left after the GAA board takes the longer-term lease. If there is, I can contact the Deputy directly.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I am aware that the GAA is using a small part of it. As Deputy Wallace just called it, it is really the "Grab All Association". If the Minister of State is telling me that it will take over such an enormous site, I will be shocked. I would love to know what the GAA is paying for it. The Department's remit covers a national emergency training centre and is spending tens of thousands of euro on renting out facilities that could be utilised in that respect. It is also spending €180,000 on security for the site. If it was being used, the same level of security would not be necessary. Will the Minister of State confirm that the GAA will take over the entire site? If so, I would like published the figure for how much is being paid for it.

I am surprised that Deputy Wallace called the GAA the "Grab All Association". I appreciate the work the GAA has done in my county, as I am sure is the case for every Deputy.

It has been recommended in many reports in recent years and is the Government's main consideration when addressing the issue, as releasing personnel for security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained, notwithstanding the fall in strength. While it has been necessary to incur costs in the provision of security to prevent vandalism and in maintenance to protect the fabric of the buildings, it should be noted that such costs are considerably lower than the cost of keeping the barracks open. Military personnel occupied in a security and support function when the four barracks closed on 30 March 2012 have been released for operational duties, leading to an efficiency gain of approximately €5 million per annum. In addition, direct cash savings of approximately €1.3 million per annum arise from utilities maintenance and security duties allowances in the four barracks. A longer-term lease for the whole of the site will be signed shortly by the Westmeath GAA board. I will find out whether any accommodation will be available and will let the Deputy know directly.

The people are proud of our Defence Forces and we owe them a great debt for all they have done for us. The least we can expect is for members of the Defence Forces to have the ability like any other citizen to make direct representations to their public representatives.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I thank the Deputy for his question. For the most part, there is no impediment to members of the Defence Forces making representations directly to their elected representatives. The only restriction in this regard relates to service matters, including postings, transfers, promotions, overseas service and other matters connected with service in the Defence Forces. Paragraph 27 of General Routine Order 43/1955 prohibits Defence Forces personnel from making representations directly to their elected representatives in respect of service matters. Paragraph 27 prohibits unauthorised communications by members of the Defence Forces and provides that all communications regarding service matters must be transmitted through the recognised official channels and that communications or requests addressed to Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, public bodies or the press are expressly forbidden. In cases where representations on service matters are made directly by or on behalf of individual members of the Defence Forces, those members are deemed to be in contravention of paragraph 27. There are no plans to amend the provisions of paragraph 27.

That should be a matter for the command structure, based on merits and so on. There is a perception among members of the Defence Forces that they cannot make any representations to public representatives and there is a huge fear around that. It is important to make it clear, for example, if they are allowed to express their concerns around the impact on their families of travelling significant distances because of the re-arrangement of the brigade structure in the State. Are they allowed to talk collectively about the impact of closures of barracks on their communities and make representations on that? It is important it is clarified what matters are appropriate, and what are not, on which members of the Defence Forces can make representations. The AGSI, Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, recently won a case in Europe to give it trade union rights. In keeping with this, does the Minister believe PDFORRA could establish the same rights, make direct representations to public representatives and its members could come directly to Deputies on matters such as those of the impact on their families and collective impact on communities?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	If a member of the Defence Forces came to the Deputy complaining about the distance they had to travel, I would think the aim of the question would be about seeking a transfer. That is not prohibited by the Defence Forces regulations. Any member of the Defence Forces can go to a representative organisation such as PDFORRA and state their concerns. PDFORRA will then make a case with Defence Forces personnel. I know that with the closure of some barracks the lives of some members of the Defence Forces were upset. All in all, most members have been accommodated in the best possible way either by their line manager or PDFORRA. However, there are no plans to amend the provisions of paragraph No. 27 of general routine order 43/1955 which prohibits Defence Forces personnel making representations directly to their Deputies and elected representatives on service matters.

Under Defence Forces regulations, personnel are obliged to vacate married quarters within a specified period of being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force. The term overholder is used to describe former members of the Defence Forces and their families who have refused to leave military married quarters within 21 days of retiring or resigning from military service. Currently, there are 28 overholders remaining at the Curragh Camp which represents a small number of those who over the years occupied married quarters but who vacated the properties on retirement or resignation from the Defence Forces, as they are required to do. Some ten of the present group of overholders do not pay charges in respect of their use of the property including for the use of electricity. As a result of the Department’s actions since January 2013, 12 of the properties which were being overheld in the area of the Curragh Camp have been returned by the occupants. The situation of overholders continuing to occupy married quarters is no longer sustainable and measures to resolve this continue to be progressed. My Department is, therefore, in accordance with normal procedures, seeking vacant possession of married quarters which are being overheld and will continue to do so until the overholding issue is resolved. Of the remaining overholding cases at the camp, the Department is aware a small number of occupants may be particularly vulnerable due to their personal circumstances. In light of this, the Department has been examining what assistance it might provide to bring about a resolution to their status as overholders. It is important to remember, however, that the Department of Defence does not have a role in the provision of housing accommodation for the public. It cannot provide housing for people who have no entitlement to such from the public purse and who may well have the means to supply housing for themselves.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	The former Minister for Defence was not noted for his softly-softly approach to issues. Accordingly, I am disappointed the Minister of State seems to be adopting a more hard-line approach and rejecting some of the progress achieved by people such as Deputy Clare Daly in raising this matter. In the course of the past month, I was struck by the plight of a family of a serving member of the Defence Forces whose wife approached me on such a matter. They had lived in Army accommodation for many years and he had over 20 years of service. They had cause to leave their Army accommodation because they had raised serious concerns with the Department of Defence about the quality of it. They had gone into private rented accommodation but it was then offered for sale, meaning they found themselves almost on the verge of homelessness with two young children about to undertake State examinations. When they went to their local authority, they were told there was nothing it could for them because they were not on its housing list. Instead, they were informed they were the responsibility of the Department of Defence. The Department has allowed this family become homeless. It has failed to step in and come to their aid at a time when it had accommodation that could have been made available to them.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	It is important to remember the Department of Defence does not have any role in the provision of housing accommodation for the general public and cannot provide housing for people who have no entitlement to such from the public purse. People are under no illusion that when they retire from the Defence Forces that they must give up their accommodation as well. They understand they are given accommodation for the duration of their service in the Defence Forces. I feel sad for any family that has to vacate a property because of this rule but they can be under no illusion that this would be the case when taking up such a tenancy. My colleague, Deputy Martin Heydon, has brought several such cases to me and there has been much dialogue over the years regarding this issue.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	The overholders can take very little comfort from what the Minister of State has said, irrespective of who may have been brought to him by Deputy Heydon. I have given the Minister of State the example of someone who is not a member of the public who is not outside the Defence Forces; I have given him the example of a serving member of the Defence Forces, who has served this country with distinction for more than two decades, and who, at a time when his children were undertaking State examinations, was caused to leave Army accommodation because the HSE was concerned about its quality. He was then made homeless as a result of having to vacate private rented accommodation. The local authority could do nothing for the family because it was not on its waiting list. One met a callous response from the Department of Defence which failed to house a serving member of the Defence Forces. If serving members of the Defence Forces cannot meet a positive response, what chance do the overholders have?

If he furnishes me with the particular circumstances, I will bring it to the attention of the Department of Defence. He stated the family went to the HSE to report the conditions of the house. My understanding is the family would have assumed the accommodation was not fit for purpose so there must be other circumstances. When a person goes to the HSE and states accommodation is not appropriate for his or her family, I am not sure whether the Defence Forces have alternative accommodation. We must take into consideration the financial constraints on the Department of Defence. If it renovates one house, many other houses would also have to be renovated to be deemed suitable for accommodation.

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, which in practice means assisting An Garda Síochána when requested to do so. There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces regarding security matters. The Defence Forces have deployed personnel to Shannon Airport in response to requests for support from An Garda Síochána since 5 February 2003. The Defence Forces carried out 32 security deployments at Shannon Airport in April of this year, 35 in May and 16 up to 12 June. The length of each such deployment and the number of relevant aircraft that land and take off during each deployment can vary. For example, if a single aircraft is on the ground for an extended period, perhaps overnight or over a number of days, this would involve more than one deployment of troops as each shift is generally of 12 hours duration. The Defence Forces have no responsibility for searching foreign military aircraft that land at Shannon and there is no record kept by the military of the country of origin of each aircraft. I understand these records are kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as foreign military aircraft are provided with diplomatic clearance to land in Ireland by that Department. With regard to inspections of aircraft being carried out by An Garda Síochána, I would advise that this is a matter that should be addressed to the Minister for Justice and Equality, but my understanding is that An Garda Síochána does not carry out searches of foreign military aircraft.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	The number of flights works out at one a day and I find it hard to credit that we are so lax about what goes on down there. As the Defence Forces have been there so often, did they take any steps to establish whether the military aircraft were transporting weapons or munitions to one or other of the belligerents in the civil wars in progress in Ukraine, Syria and Iraq? If not, why not? Will the Minister of State comment on the presence of a US Government jet with the tail number N977GA at Shannon airport? This jet was previously used by CIA rendition flights, as recorded at Shannon Airport a number of times by the Shannonwatch group. Recent media reports stated that the jet left Washington on the same night that Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong, with the hope of picking him up in the event Russia did not grant him asylum. Does the Minister of State agree that simply relying on diplomatic assurances from the US with regard to rendition flights is not sufficient to comply with the State's obligations to prevent torture, prohibit ill-treatment taking place in its territory or airspace and ensure its territory is not used to facilitate extraordinary rendition?

Security assessments are carried out by An Garda Síochána, which determines whether Defence Forces assistance is required. We only provide assistance. I am not sure what date the Deputy referred to with regard to searching aircraft. He should raise this issue with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, or the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. As I stated, the Department of Defence only assists An Garda Síochána at Shannon Airport.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	It is appropriate to the Minister of State because if it was not it would have been ruled out of order and moved by the Ceann Comhairle's office. The Minister of State does have a role in this regard. The figures he gave are absolutely shocking. At least once a day Army personnel are involved in protecting US aircraft. The Minister of State told us to ask the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade where the aircraft are from but I am sure this is the answer. I have not noticed any Russian planes stopping at Shannon Airport. What does the Minister of State think all of these aircraft, which must stop and refuel, are doing if they are not carrying munitions or engaged in any activity? It is a hugely costly effort to move military aircraft particularly these ones. Considering that Defence Forces personnel are not bothering to examine what they are doing, but are there on practically a daily basis, what does the Minister of State think the US authorities are doing by moving the aircraft on such a consistent basis?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	In March, a report in The Guardian newspaper stated the US had delivered 100 hellfire missiles, along with assault rifles and ammunition, to Iraq at the beginning of that month. It is ridiculous the House cannot confirm that none of these weapons transited through Shannon. Iraq is falling apart at the seams because of the US's warmongering efforts there and we are facilitating it. We do not seem to have any inch or issue with what goes on at Shannon Airport.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, to delete lines 5 to 37, and to delete page 7.When Members were discussing this Bill on Committee Stage, I made the point that only a few days had elapsed between the conclusion of Second Stage and the beginning of Committee Stage. If my recollection is correct, I recounted at the time that on the first day of the Second Stage debate, I received an urgent communication from the Bills Office to submit my amendments for Committee Stage. This is despite the Government's specific commitment in its programme for Government to allowing at least a fortnight to elapse between Second and Committee Stages to give Members a chance to reflect on the Second Stage debate, on their amendments and so on. This appears to me to be fairly fundamental and the Minister's excuse was there was a deadline it was necessary to meet. However, the bottom line is Members would have met the deadline, with the appropriate gaps, had the Second Stage debate been introduced earlier. One week later, having barely finished the Committee Stage debate, Members now have been shunted into Report Stage, have been told it will conclude today, that this will be it and to get their amendments out of the way. I have asked the Taoiseach a number of times in this Chamber about that specific commitment in the programme for Government. I have been asking him about it for four or five months but each time I do so, he laughs it off. He actually told me on one occasion that the Chief Whip's wife had a young baby and he had other things on his mind. He had some other half-cocked excuse last week. This is pretty fundamental to the way in which business is done in Ireland and to the functions and operation of this House. It is fundamental to the manner in which Members hold the Executive to account, which is their responsibility. While a constitutional revolution was promised, it is absolutely appalling to think that 75% to 80% through the lifetime of the current Administration, legislation still is being shunted through in this fashion. I consider it to be a disgrace that gives the lie to all those promises of fundamental change, constitutional revolutions and so on. In respect of amendment No. 1, I made the point on Committee Stage that the post office network is vital to the country's social fabric. The moves that are being made to cannibalise the current post office network represent another nail in the coffin of rural Ireland. If one looks around the countryside, one sees shops, local Garda stations and bank branches closing down, as well as a countryside ravaged by emigration. The Government has now set itself on a path that, if this process is followed, will result in a majority of rural post offices closing down. The Government states it is operating in accordance with market forces and while market forces may be one thing, social responsibility also must be taken into account and comes into the equation somewhere. I would have thought it was of particular importance to the Labour Party but obviously, I am mistaken. Section 3 of this Bill sends out a definite signal. The Irish Postmasters Union has conducted a high-profile nationwide campaign to save the post office network. It has made points that have not been answered satisfactorily by the Government and has indicated ways in which the business of post offices could be improved both to the benefit of the Exchequer and to the social benefit of the country because they would help to retain the remaining element of life in remote rural areas in particular. I represent an area that is largely urban and which has experienced a few post office closures. The communities in these areas have not yet recovered from the loss of those post offices, albeit there are other places to which they can go and which are a distance away that would appear to be hardly anything in the countryside. Half a mile in the city literally is over to the other end of town, whereas it is a very small distance in the countryside. However, even urban communities have been undermined by the closure of post offices. The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is the basic legislation pertaining to social welfare and a part of that Act deals with service provision in which An Post is mentioned specifically as the service provider. Under the provisions of this Bill, An Post is being removed by something called "the service provider", which literally could mean anything, be it An Post or anything else. Consequently, it is opening up the possibility that An Post might even lose the social welfare contract, which of course would be absolutely devastating. In so far as I could understand the Minister's reply on Committee Stage the last day, she stated that unless she brought about this change, the contract that An Post has won to provide social welfare payments might be challenged. I cannot understand this particular reason. I acknowledge there was a court case in 2007 in which this system was challenged and in which the High Court decided there must be a fair competition. However, a fair competition took place and An Post won that competition fair and square. Moreover, that competition happened while the legislation still specifically mentioned An Post. If the competition took place against a background of legislation that specifically mentioned An Post, how then can the legal situation be changed by changing the legislation now? It happened and were someone to challenge the veracity of that contract tomorrow, he or she would be able to challenge it on the basis that An Post was specifically mentioned in the legislation that was operable at the time. Consequently, it appears to me as though changing it now makes absolutely no difference with regard to a challenge to the contract. This smacks of simply throwing out answers for the sake of being able to state one responded to the debate although one really has nothing to say. The Minister will be aware that her colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has stated several times, both in this House and outside it in meetings with the Irish Postmasters Union and so on, that the Government is firmly committed to the future of the post office network. However, this legislation and this provision tell another story. While I wish to give other Members a chance to speak on this matter, my point to the Minister is it makes absolutely no difference to the legality of the competition that has been contested and won by An Post that this change be made. It does not help it or detract from it in any way. However, it sends out a bad signal that the Government is not genuine about what it says, is not sincere and really has in mind a situation in which the post office network will be further and further diminished.That would be disastrous for the country both socially and economically. As a gesture of goodwill to the postmasters' union and to the hundreds of thousands of other people throughout this country who rely on the post office and who want the post office network to be preserved, I ask the Minister to change that section along the lines suggested. I am not demanding that she accept my amendment which perhaps is badly drafted - I am not sure - but there are a number of amendments or she could instead introduce an amendment. The main issue is that the deletion of An Post as the service-provider for the post office network should be changed and An Post should be restored to the position it held in 2005.

My amendments have the same intention which is to ensure that the current position, at the very least, remains, that An Post as the service-provider is written in the law and this gives it a greater standing and perhaps greater protection against the opening up of the An Post network of shops or cash points to privatisation, open competition, call it what one may. I concur with Deputy O'Dea's point about the process for dealing with Bills in general. Second Stage was a rushed affair. The Bill had been published the week before it was taken in the House. The day before it was taken in the House, the officials helpfully provided advice to our parliamentary assistants to allow them to work through the details of the Bill. Most of the issues are not overly contentious and some of the provisions are quite technical. That briefing and advice was most helpful in efforts to clarify the provisions in the Bill. It can be a difficult process because even though all social welfare legislation was consolidated in the 2005 Act, two to three Bills are published every year and one needs to refer to all of them. My advice to the Minister would be that if the Department is working on the basis of a consolidated Bill, this should be made available to the public or at the very least to Members. It would make our work a lot easier when preparing for a debate. I suggest this should be the practice with every piece of legislation from every Department. The Finance Bill is a classic example where a principal Act is constantly being referred to. It would make life for everyone a lot easier. The Government has promised on previous occasions that it would consider my request that at the very least the explanatory memorandums to Bills would be published as Gaeilge. If I wished to contribute to a debate on a Bill as Gaeilge I would be able to do so using the same terminology as in an explanatory memorandum and in the final Bill when enacted. The Minister herself suggested the compromise of publishing explanatory memorandums in 2011 because the Government did not intend to publish Bills bilingually. To return to the point about the procedure, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made great play of the democratic revolution and changes in the House. When the first proposals for Dáil reform were made, we were promised that there would be no guillotining and that sufficient time would be allowed to debate legislation. While this legislation is not being guillotined there is less than a week between the Stages of the Bill which does not allow sufficient time. I was first elected in 2002 and the convention since then was to allow two weeks between Stages of a Bill. This legislation is not generally contentious and it does not require immediate passage. According to the Minister the only section that requires immediate passage is that which is bound by an EU directive which was first passed in 2010. The Government at the time sought a period of two years' grace before implementing the directive. However, in 2012, it was decided that the issues contained in the directive had not been fully addressed and the Government sought a further delay. The Government asked the EU for a two year extension before transposing the directive into Irish law. That was four years ago and two years ago a further two year extension was sought. Now we are landed with it in a rush because it has to be passed into Irish law by August or there will be a fine imposed on the State. Leaving this matter to the last minute is bad practice. The main issue in these amendments is that An Post is mentioned in the legislation as being the service provider. I refer to the sections in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 where An Post is mentioned. Section 5 refers to any expenses incurred by An Post under Part 2. No other provider is mentioned. The section states that the Minister shall make payment out of the Social Insurance Fund to An Post. Section 242 refers to the payment of specified benefits through An Post. In section 274 "specified agency" means An Post or a person authorised to carry on banking business. There was a reason for the reference to An Post throughout the 2005 Act and the intention of my amendment is to revert to that position. I was even willing at one stage to contemplate An Post or another service provider, but at the very least An Post is mentioned because that gives it some protection in law. The Minister stated on Committee Stage that it was not her intention or the Government's intention to undermine An Post and the post office network and that a new contract was in place. There is nothing to protect against another Minister for Social Protection or another Minister for communications deciding that this is not to be and that magical term would be used that this would be contrary to the market - that great market everyone talks about - and An Post would lose that contract, the consequences of which would be very significant. Over the years, many Deputies have been lobbied by the Irish Postmasters' Union, individual postmasters and postmistresses and post office workers about the dangers the loss of the social welfare contract would present for post office services. Such is the value of the social welfare contract that its loss would result in the immediate closure of post offices not only in rural areas, but also in Dublin. This fact was recognised in the reference in previous legislation to "An Post". I cannot understand the reason for the Minister's decision to provide for the deletion of all references to "An Post" from the legislation. She has argued that the public service card is an ideal mechanism for addressing fraud and achieving what are known as control savings. Having all social welfare transactions made via an anonymous bank will create a problem because it will be possible for all payments to be withdrawn via automated teller machines, thereby limiting engagement between the recipient and a public servant or an official. This will preclude recipients being challenged and having their public service card checked to ensure the correct person is claiming the allowance.  I suggested previously that all social welfare payments should be collected in person from a post office. While I am no longer inclined to support that position, the vast majority of able-bodied recipients of social welfare payments, specifically jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, but also other State payments made to people in employment and the unemployed, should be made via An Post. In recent years, social welfare officers have encouraged people to have payments made through their bank. Anonymising the system in this manner increases scope for fraud, which defies the logic of introducing the long-awaited and expensive public service card, the purpose of which is to ensure social welfare recipients' identification will be checked at some point. People who receive payments via their bank will not be subject to identity checks and will be able to withdraw money from a bank anywhere in the world.  If An Post were to lose its contract for social welfare payments, we would lose a vital part of the fabric of society. Many people in Dublin do not understand the vital role post offices play in rural areas. In many small villages, the only services available are a grocery, pub and post office. If they lose their post office, the other two institutions immediately close, which creates a ghost village or ghost town. I urge the Minister to accept the amendments or at least the spirit behind them and ensure An Post is afforded preferred bidder status. She argues it is not possible to do so under European competition law. It could be done under EU social law on the basis that the objective of affording preferred bidder status to the post office would be to protect the social fabric. Public service obligations apply to other aspects of life and could apply in this instance if the purpose is to allow for the retention of post offices. In addition, An Post would not benefit from any grant or subsidy from the State but from a decision on the part of the State that, in the interests of society and communities, it proposes to channel moneys through the post office network. Such a decision would send out a good signal.  On Committee Stage, the Minister argued that no other institution could deliver the contract for social welfare services because any payment service provider bidding for the contract would have to be able to deliver it in a similar number of locations as it is currently delivered by An Post through its network of post offices. A number of entities could put together a bid for the contract. For example, if a large number of bookmaker offices, petrol stations or publicans came together, they could deliver a payments service. It is also foreseeable that large retail chains such as Tesco or SuperValu could submit a bid on the basis that they have outlets at locations nationwide. If the Minister moves in the direction proposed, multinational or indigenous companies could bid for the business currently provided by An Post. The contract for the provision of social welfare payments is lucrative because it involves a large number of transactions. The current trend is towards locating post offices in retail outlets such as SuperValu and Tesco stores. The only reason such companies agree to have post offices located in their stores is that it encourages social welfare recipients to spend some of their payment in the store. Many people are concerned that they are, to some extent, being forced to shop in the location in which they receive their blind pension, children's allowance or jobseeker's payment. I accept that this matter is not covered by the legislation. The Bill creates the possibility that An Post will not deliver the financial transactions that take place between the State and social welfare recipients. 
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I support the principle behind the amendments. We discussed these issues on Committee Stage. An Post should continue to be enshrined in the Act as the named service provider for a number of reasons, including fraud. As I noted on Committee Stage, I suspect that if an analysis were done of fraud, it would show there is much less fraud associated with the sub-post office network than the other payment mechanisms the Department has introduced. Perhaps the Minister has figures that will confirm my view. Last year, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister stated that control measures had achieved savings of €632 million through the identification of fraud, client error, departmental error and refunds from estates. This is a significant sum, especially as people must dig deep to fund the social welfare system through the universal social charge, property tax, income tax, increased VAT rates and, from next year onwards, water charges. This is how the system is bankrolled. On the one hand, we have in place an extensive national network of sub-post offices while, on the other, An Post continues to squeeze local post offices. A case in point is the post office in Cappataggle in my constituency where, at a large meeting last Monday night, the local community expressed serious anger about the potential loss of its post office, particularly as a family member of the previous postmistress is willing to take over the business.One cannot look at the sub-post office network in isolation. In many communities, it is maintaining the community as a whole. It is maintaining some other business, whether it be a shop or a petrol pump. In many cases, it is the only premises left in the village as everything else has closed. The Minister will come back and provide reassurance stating that, as part of the contract, there is a condition that the service provider must be able to provide a service to 95% of the population within a 15 km radius. As I pointed out to her, that would involve a 19 mile round trip which would be significant for many, particularly the elderly in isolated rural areas. It could be a much greater distance if the local sub-post office closed, with residents having to travel multiples of that distance. In that context, it is important to remember we are talking about a country where one third of pensioners live on their own, many of them in isolated rural situations. Many of them have little contact with any form of civilisation from one end of the week to the other, except for the local postmistress whom they visit in the post office to collect their pension. The Minister is trying to provide us with reassurance about 95% coverage. After the committee meeting, I thought that sounded familiar. It was bugging me all week. Then I realised it is the same story that is trotted out in relation to broadband, that 95% of the population is covered by broadband. The difficulty is that one has better broadband coverage on the moon than one has in some parts of Ireland. Is the Minister saying that such is the type of service she wants in place for the collection of social welfare payments through the post office network? I would remind her that a large number of these payments - probably the biggest cash payment made - are social assistance payments. These are payments that are made to those who cannot make ends meet from one end of the week to the other without this basic payment from the Department of Social Protection and who have to eat into that basic payment to pay for the taxi to go to collect their money. The Minister's party colleague, Deputy Brendan Ryan, put forward an alternative on Committee Stage and she dismissed it on the basis that An Post is written into the statutory instrument. The Minister might think that some members of the Government parties will swallow that hook, line and sinker, but she will not pull the wool over our eyes on this side of the House. As she knows well, a statutory instrument can be changed at the stroke of a pen, laid before the House and become law overnight. An Post can be taken out of the statutory instrument at the whim of the Minister or a future Minister at some future date. I presume Deputy Burton will not be in this Department too much longer and while I have a lot of time for her and respect her, I would not necessarily trust some of the other suspects who might end up in this Department after her.

Whether an endorsement from me will be of assistance or not is another matter. I made the point on Committee Stage that An Post staff, particularly the postmasters and postmistresses throughout the country, can play a far more valuable role because they have signed the Official Secrets Act 1963 while many of the other service providers, those that are being considered by the Minister, have not. From a social point of view, I would have concerns in that regard. First, as I stated, if one knows the rate of social assistance payment that someone is getting, one knows the total household income. One can tell a lot from a person's payment. Also, there is a role that those staff can play in sub-post offices in assisting the public in submitting applications online which would make the processing of those applications far more efficient for the Department. The Department's Secretary General, and every other Secretary General within Government, would be delighted if every application they received were submitted online because it would streamline the process. The difficulty is it involves closing the door to those who do not have access to electronic communication, who are not able to use computers and who are not IT literate. An Post and the sub-post office network could fill that void. One example I came across during the week relates to four individuals, from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and my constituency, who have had their beef genomics scheme application refused on the basis that they could not provide evidence that the application was received by the Department. Why not have An Post, through the sub-post office network, working to provide that service to the public in order that such applications could be submitted electronically? The Minister also makes the argument that she cannot force social welfare recipients to collect their payments at a sub-post office because they have built up an entitlement and there is flexibility of movement throughout the European Union. She is perfectly correct in relation to benefit payments where recipients have made a contribution or there is an automatic entitlement, and one cannot take that away from them. However, social assistance payments are completely different. Social assistance payments are based on one's address and one's means. There is no reason social assistance payments, particularly unemployment assistance or, as it is now called, jobseeker's allowance, should not be paid through post offices. There are many other payments that could be made that way that would address the issues of client error and fraud and would identify some of the issues of departmental error. I believe that the benefit to the Department would far outweigh the potential cost savings that are being thought about within the Department by squeezing An Post by bringing in another service provider. Those aspects could be tied in to a social provision that would be allowed within EU competition rules. If some other service provider can provide the same level of service in this jurisdiction, so be it. I very much doubt it. We should look to see how we can sweat the existing assets to greatly improve efficiency and error detection within the Department and make far greater savings than the couple of pence that can be saved by closing the local sub-post office and forcing the elderly into taxis to travel 20, 21 or 22 miles to pick up their old age pension.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I will begin with an apology because when I finish here, I must return to a committee meeting. Apologies to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister. If this Parliament were a board of directors of an entity called Ireland Inc., we would probably examine the Bill under a number of headings. We would try to ensure we had the right mix and type of services, allowances and pensions. Obviously, we would look at the cost of providing those services. We would look at how streamlined and accessible the services are for those who need them. We would look to ensure the system was robust and trustworthy. We would look to see whether this system had a track record of meeting people's needs.In addition, we will be examining whether taxpayers' interests are protected in the process. Post offices and sub-post offices should be viewed as an extremely valuable and trusted network of public service outlets. In that respect, they are more than just post offices and can be easily accessed by all citizens. Most importantly, although it is not always taken into account, the post office has a hard-won reputation and brand that is highly regarded and respected. Yet that network will be at grave risk if the number of customers doing business in such outlets falls. The footfall will determine the network's sustainability and viability.  A recent Grant Thornton report on the future of the post office network found that if the social welfare contract was lost, over 550 post office closures could be expected. Even if the social welfare contract is kept at a reduced rate, well over 400 post offices would be at risk of closure. That is a stark figure, but we have a choice. We can do something to ensure that this trusted brand of accessible services can be sustained, or we can take an alternative decision which will damage the existing network beyond repair. There is a difference between pension or other social welfare transactions and buying bread, milk or petrol. The difference with post offices is that there is continuity of communications and a trust has been built up. The continuity of staffing is also a factor. The elderly, in particular, like to get to know the people they are dealing with over the counter and it takes years to build up that trust. Thankfully, we do not have a high turnover of staff in post offices or sub-post offices. The same cannot be said for other possible outlets. The quality of communications, confidentiality, trust and the sensitivity associated with pensions and allowances all need to be taken into account. Post offices have never let people down but the banks have. We should not even consider awarding social welfare contracts to any network other than post offices. Why change something that works and has been working so well for so long? As a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I was part of a group that drafted a report on the future of our post office network. That report made a number of recommendations as to how the network could remain viable. Given the social benefit of personal contact that exists between post office staff and their customers, the committee recommended that other Government services should also be made available through that network.  One must consider the isolation that exists in society today, even in inner city Dublin not to mention rural areas. It is particularly the case for older people living in rural areas, however. It therefore seems appropriate that Government services should be moved to a facility with which people are comfortable and in which they have confidence. These payments could include motor-tax renewals, hospital charges, business rates, rents and any other Government services. It is one thing to talk about putting new services into post offices but if we, as a board of directors of Ireland Inc., make a decision that will have the unintended - but very clear - consequence of removing social welfare payments from post offices, we may as well say that we will shut down the network. A number of amendments have been tabled to the Bill by my party colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, and others. They have highlighted the need for this social welfare contract to be maintained by An Post. I would passionately argue that those amendments should be taken on board due to their importance. It does not just concern the quality of services to the public, but also the existing trusted infrastructure involved.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	It is not so long since we last discussed the same issues with the Minister. As other Deputies have said, there is a problem with the time allowed for tabling amendments. Larger parties have a greater ability to respond and table amendments quite quickly, but it is difficult for individual Deputies to do so because they do not have the staff to assist them that swiftly. When discussing the Bill last week, the Minister said that An Post won the last tendering process because it was able to provide services through its network of outlets. She also noted An Post's 95% population coverage over 15 km in rural areas and 3 km in urban areas. An Post is thus able to provide the services and matched the criteria for the tendering process. In addition, the Minister said she hoped that would be enough to facilitate the post office network in rural areas.  However, the programme for Government specifically stated that it would support the post office network. By removing from the main legislation the provision that An Post should be included in the provision of social welfare payments, it sends a bad message to the post office network and the public that the Government does not have this matter on its agenda. Deputy Naughten said the statutory instrument can be changed at any time by future Ministers, so the provision needs to stay in the Bill. If the tendering process is correct, above board and facilitates the post office network in providing these services according to the tendering process, nobody will challenge it. Once we acknowledge that the post office can provide those services, the system cannot be challenged. Following last week's debate, I read an article about SuperValu priming itself to become a potential provider of services traditionally offered by An Post. SuperValu has many shops around the country in cities, towns and villages.  I wish to raise a question on the social aspect involved. If one is tendering to provide social protection payments, such as job seeker's allowance or carer's benefit, do the regulations governing the process state that service providers must be able to deal with customers individually and that workers in such places will have a certain wage? We are talking about servicing 3,000 staff who currently work in the post office network. What other measures are in the Bill to give An Post the ability to compete against super stores around the country?When the postmasters met us previously they spoke about how bad the situation has become in Britain, where many rural post offices have closed because they cannot compete against Tesco. All Tesco is interested in is getting footfall across the door and bringing more people to its shops in order to promote its own products. The service it provides is questionable and we should be aware of the potential for this outcome in Ireland. I suggest the Minister should include the words "and-or" in regard to An Post being the preferred provider for these services. There is a social weight to the services that the post office network provides to communities. We outlined the reasons last week and the Minister acknowledged that we are a concerned bunch of Deputies on this side of the House when it comes to the quality of services provided by An Post. We have to realise that the post office is a point of contact for many elderly people who receive services through An Post. Some 18% of Irish people do not have bank accounts and 23%, or almost one quarter of the population, do not have access to the Internet. Many people rely on the post office to pay their bills, paying €5 here and €10 there, because of austerity and the fact that they must count the pennies. We must emphasise the social aspect of the post office network as well as the economic viability of allowing, without undue favouritism, post offices to provide services to a wide range of people. The people who receive social welfare are not economic units or mere clients; they are service users who deserve respect from this State in terms of how they receive their social payments. We should do everything possible to ensure the EU cannot challenge us and, if it does challenge us, we should explain the social fabric of our nation and what the post office network provides. I supported the amendments tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh last week and I similarly support the amendments he is moving today. I urge the Minister to consider including the phrase "service providers and-or An Post" to allow the State to maintain its support for the post office network. Communities, postmasters and An Post will thereby see that the Government is serious about backing the network. The programme for Government specifically commits to protecting the post office network. How can that commitment be achieved if services are opened to SuperValu and other networks in the towns and villages? They cannot provide the same type of service or knowledge of communities that An Post has built up over the last 100 years.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I thank the Deputy. He is looking after both of us. I appreciate his interest as much as I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does. In regard to the general issue of the tight timescale for progressing Social Welfare Bills, which arises from the need to implement various budget measures, the submission from FLAC commented on this. However, FLAC's submission would have serious implications for already tight timelines. I recall that it took the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection more than six months to examine the transgender Bill under the new arrangements. Everybody in this House operates to tight timetables. I am glad that the heads of the aforementioned Bill were published yesterday and I thank the committee and its members for its deliberations over a protracted period. Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested that we make the in-house guide on the various amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act available to the public, subject to appropriate disclaimers. I would broadly favour that approach and I recognise it would be useful to Members, social welfare practitioners and the public in general. I will consider the suggestion. A certain amount of work may be required to prepare the guidelines for publication but I accept the Deputy's point and will revert to him. It is probably not something we can do immediately but I would be more than happy to consider it because I think it would be helpful to people. I thank him for the proposal. I do not propose to accept the amendments. I will explicitly address the concerns that have been voiced by a number of Deputies regarding the technical amendments set out in section 3 of the Bill. There is a misapprehension that the proposed amendments will in some way threaten the future viability of An Post or diminish its position in social welfare legislation. That is absolutely not the case. I want to reassure older people, in particular, because there may be an amount of campaigning type propaganda - not here but outside - which is giving rise to fear among elderly people that the services they receive from the Department of Social Protection are at risk. I would like to send the message that they are not at risk. The amendments are designed to achieve two objectives. They aim to protect the State and its contract with An Post from challenges by third parties. This is what happened with the previous Government. A challenge was issued in 1999 which ultimately wound its way to the highest European courts and which suggested that the contract would have to be put out to tender. That is the history of the matter. The core objective we are trying to achieve is to give An Post, as the Department's contracted payments service provider, the necessary authority to assist the Department with its fraud and control measures. As a number of Deputies have noted in their contributions, An Post is uniquely placed to assist the Department in fraud and control measures. That is probably a significant part of the reason for An Post's success in winning the contract. As Minister I have, for example, directed that jobseekers' payments should be collected in person because An Post is in a unique position to assist with verification and to ensure the people who receive the payments are who they claim to be and are in this country, as they are required to be unless they have otherwise notified their local social welfare office. These amendments support the contract I signed prior to Christmas and which is currently in place. This contract will maintain the continuity of cash payment services throughout the towns and villages of Ireland. As I indicated during our Committee Stage discussion, the contract has a duration of two years and will be renewable for a further four years. While I hope An Post will seek to renew the contract, that is a matter for the management of the company. Given that An Post gets a significant amount of valuable work through the Department of Social Protection, I am sure it will be in favour of maintaining the contract. I do not want these unfounded concerns to cause unnecessary anxiety among the clients of my Department. The amendments provide a solid legislative basis for the arrangements under which payment services are to be delivered by An Post as a payment service provider.Critically, they also enable An Post to carry out activities that will contribute to the prevention and deterrence of welfare fraud and enhanced control. That is very clear from the text of the Bill. In all procurements by the Department of Social Protection or any other Department, EU procurement rules must be adhered to and there is a host of legal provisions and case law to guide a Department's procurement processes. Of particular importance in this regard is the requirement that certain principles must be applied and be seen to be applied; these include non-discrimination, equal treatment and transparency. Non-compliance with these legal stipulations could render our procurements and the contracts arising from procurement competitions null and void. The contracts with An Post were legally contested and objected to during the previous Government's term by people entitled to do so. We must ensure we avoid the risk of contracts being open to legal challenge in the interests of the continuity of welfare payments. There are valuable consequences of An Post being a contractor for the company and postmasters, which people have mentioned, and it is also important for services to our clients. Transparency is of particular importance and the European Court of Justice ruling made it clear in a 2007 decision that any further contract without a formal and public competition would put us in breach of EU directives. Deputy O'Dea was a Minister at that time but the legislation was not amended after the court ruling, although arrangements were put in place for cash payment through An Post until 2013. In preparation for the cessation of those arrangements, my priority was on having a robust procurement competition and an open process. This procurement was the first full and clear specification of the scope and scale of services required to support cash payment services to welfare clients, with specific regard to issues around the prevention and detection of fraud and the enhancement of the control procedures. With regard to the work of postmasters, the business strategy of An Post is in the first instance the concern of the company's board and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. My officials and I will continue to work resolutely with An Post and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his Department officials to ensure a strong and vibrant post office network. I serve an urban area, although it has a rural hinterland, and the Deputies have mainly spoken about rural post offices. Small post offices and sub-post offices in urban areas are equally important to people living in urban areas. I am aware of the concerns aired in debates but as the Minister I must ensure the arrangements entered into can stand up to scrutiny, and neither I nor An Post can be exposed to risk with the existing contract won by An Post. In this respect Deputies must be careful what they wish for. Some people seem to suggest that people should not have any right to use any access to electronic fund transfers, for example. The An Post business case must be developed by the company but it should develop a capacity for electronic funds services either on its own or potentially in conjunction with another provider. It is a significant and important contract area. On Committee Stage some people veered almost to arguing that people should be forced to use their local post office. Would people put up their hands to indicate how many are receiving child benefit directly from a local post office? If somebody has a bank account, although people bemoan it the preference is to use the service for the sake of convenience; that is instead of going to queue in a local post office. The critical issue is the upgrading of services within local post offices to ensure they can compete with electronic fund transfers. I do not know how many Deputies would say to retirees in receipt of a pension from the Department of Social Protection that they should not be allowed the choice of putting the money directly into bank accounts but rather that they should have to queue at a post office. I am not sure that is what Deputies intend.

Government Deputies were the most vocal in their undying loyalty to the preservation of the post office network. All we were missing in some places was a stack of bibles, and if they were available every one of the Deputies would have put their hands on them and sworn eternal loyalty to the post office network. Today they are ready to come here to eradicate the one reference to An Post in social welfare legislation. The Minister's excuse for the short timeframe was that we spent six months dealing with transgender legislation. That was fairly well ventilated but surely it is no excuse for rushing social welfare legislation. How can such an unseemly rush be justified in that way? It is nonsense.

The competition took place and An Post won it. At the time, the relevant legislation was from 2005 and it specifically mentioned An Post. The Minister has now told us that somebody could now have a better chance of challenging the legislation if the proposed change is not made. It is a legal nonsense. The competition took place and if somebody was to challenge the validity of the contract with An Post now, that party would do so on the basis that An Post was mentioned in the 2005 legislation. Any change to it now will not alter that fact, as the Minister well knows.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	Yesterday, the Government accepted that it could no longer stand over cases of people with acute medical conditions and multiple disabilities losing their medical cards. It accepted that discretionary cards should be restored to 15,000 people in that category who lost them, until at least July 2015. Those people, however, will get no refund even though the Government has accepted that it wrongly took the cards from them and has inflicted considerable costs on them. The Carers Association yesterday estimated that losing the cards would have cost many families up to €1,200 a month. Young Katie Connolly’s condition would cost her family €7,000 a year but she lost her medical card. The Government caused that family considerable distress. This money should be refunded. Will the Taoiseach put in place a mechanism to facilitate that? I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the other 15,000 who had lost their medical cards. What is to happen to them? They will not get them back. Over 30,000 people lost their medical cards, according to the Government’s statistics. Only 15,000 are getting them back. Some were paralysed with fear and shock and were not in any position to respond to the infamous letters sent out over the past two and a half years.  Yesterday’s decision also creates further injustices. Thousands of people who since 2011 would have applied for discretionary medical cards, who have acute conditions and disabilities were governed by the same policy framework that governed the removal of the 30,000 cards. They have been refused and will get no medical card, although the Government accepts that the policy framework was wrong and is giving cards back to 15,000 people who lost them as a result. Anybody who receives a new diagnosis in coming weeks or months will be governed by the policy framework the Taoiseach said was wrong, an admission which occasioned his decision to restore the card to 15,000 people. The Taoiseach has to accept this is a shambles and is inconsistent and incoherent.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	The Deputy has asked a range of questions. The Government accepts, and the Minister for Health made quite clear, that it is completely unacceptable that families were put through the stress and strain that arose from the decision to centralise the assessment for medical cards. I pointed out to Deputy Martin yesterday that under the Health Act 1970 the cards are governed by the phrase “undue hardship” and circumstances that apply thereafter for access to medical facilities, as distinct from the particular kind of card. Yesterday the Government made a clear decision to make €13 million available to deal with the return of cards to people who had lost them since July 2011 on a discretionary basis. When a person applies for a medical card and is turned down discretion is applied and in many cases extended, depending on the range of medical circumstances that apply, the general income of the household and so on. When the review was carried out people lost their cards. The Government’s decision yesterday was very clear. It will cost €13 million to return cards to those who lost them on the review which began when centralisation started in 2011. One of the senior personnel at the Health Service Executive confirmed this morning that it is working flat out to ensure that within the next four weeks those cards will be returned to those 15,000 people, 13,000 of whom received a general practitioner card. The Deputy mentioned people who applied or were unable to respond because of their particular challenge, difficulty or medical circumstance. The HSE will of course take those circumstances into account because it has to. People can be stressed or under pressure, or for various reasons may not be in a position to respond in the way that one might expect. I know for instance of a couple of cases in which people with motor neurone disease were asked by the computer to respond. They were unable to speak and move and therefore could not respond.

My fundamental point is that there is inconsistency and incoherence at the heart of the decisions he has taken, particularly yesterday’s decision. A child born today with a rare syndrome will be subject to the framework under which 15,000 lost cards which are now being given back. That child will not get a medical card irrespective of the rarity of the syndrome. In 2013, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health signed off on the HSE service plan which said there would be policy changes that would bring discretionary medical card numbers down to approximately 50,000. There were 63,000 discretionary medical cards at the beginning of 2013, and 50,000 at the end of the year, as a result of the Government’s policy decisions. Anybody with severe conditions who applied from 2011 on was refused. Those people did not have cards before 2011. How will the Taoiseach rectify the injustice to those people? The Taoiseach mentioned motor neurone disease. How will somebody diagnosed with the condition in the next three or four months get a discretionary medical card? The same question arises for a child with multiple disabilities. There is a fundamental incoherence and inconsistency here and the Taoiseach needs to deal with that. What has been proposed to date is not satisfactory. Does the Taoiseach accept that his decision is inconsistent and incoherent?

The Taoiseach's reference to the centralisation of the processing of medical card applications is merely a smokescreen to cover the Government's embarrassment and hide its shame. The Minister, Deputy Reilly, indicated yesterday that he has received categorical assurances from fellow Ministers - he did not say "all Ministers" - that the €13 million projected cost of reissuing these cards would be new money for the health budget and would not result in cuts elsewhere across the health services. Who are these Ministers? Has the Minister, Deputy Reilly, received a full Cabinet assurance that additional moneys will be provided? Is consideration being given to not utilising this year the moneys that were set aside for 2014 to facilitate the roll-out of free GP care for everyone up to the age of six? Is it possible that some of those moneys will be employed in this regard? On "Morning Ireland" this morning, the director of primary care, John Hennessy, outlined three criteria that are being taken into account. The second of those criteria is a requirement for the person in question to have completed a review process during the relevant period. There is a huge discrepancy between the number of people in that category, which is 15,000, and the number of cards that have been removed, which is 30,000. There is no doubt in the minds of Deputies across this Chamber that many people who had their so-called discretionary medical cards taken from them looked at the situation and decided there was no point in proceeding with the review process because they could see nothing other than a rollercoaster of culling. Are people who validly held medical cards but did not proceed with the review process to be excluded from consideration now? If the criteria that have been laid down are used, their hurt will be compounded. The primary care reimbursement scheme, which is overseeing the reimbursement of medical cards-----

One of the issues that arose when the assessment system was centralised was the clear difference between what was being done at various locations throughout the country.

The centralisation of this process was not a smokescreen. It was designed to ensure the assessment would be fair for everybody. Clearly, there were enormous difficulties for some Members in that regard. It was not a smokescreen at all.

Many people felt intimidated by the entire barrage that came from the Government, which insisted that this cull must take place in the interests of so-called probity. I hope the door has been left open for such people. Will there be a process of appeal or review for those who have had their cards cut over the relevant period, but who do not receive a letter in the coming weeks as Mr. Hennessy has indicated? Will there be an opportunity for them to present again? What about those who applied for cards on discretionary grounds over the relevant period and had their applications refused? Given that the same criteria of assessment were applied to such people between 2011 and 2014, surely they are equally entitled to have their positions taken into account now. Those who were holding discretionary medical cards - many voices on the Government benches claimed that such cards never existed - were not the only people to be targeted. What about the over 70s who were targeted during the exact same period? I know of many cases of people over the age of 70 who have gone through undoubted anguish and suffering because they have lost their medical cards and have to depend on GP-only cards, which are very inadequate replacements for what they previously had great faith in.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	The Deputy has raised a number of questions. The Minister for Health requested a detailed examination of the status on 1 March of this year of the holders of the 78,000 discretionary medical cards that were in circulation on 1 March 2011. I will give the House the relevant information that emerged from that process. On 1 March last, some 33% of them - or 25,398 individuals - still held medical cards on a discretionary basis; some 49% of them - or 37,906 individuals - held medical cards based on assessment of means; and some 19% of them - or 14,621 individuals - no longer held medical cards. Within the latter group, some 2,521 people, or 3% of the total figure, were deceased; some 5,145 people, or 7% of the total figure, did not respond to correspondence from the HSE; some 1,522 people, or 2% of the total figure, initially engaged with the HSE did not complete the review process by providing all the required documentation; and some 5,433 people, or 7% of the total figure, completed the review process only to be found to be ineligible for a medical card. That is the current status of the 78,000 people who held medical cards on a discretionary basis in 2011, based on what happened them between 2011 and March of this year. Those who had their cards granted as part of the discretionary allocation, but lost those cards on review or assessment, will have those cards restored. That will account for a portion of the €13 million cost that the Cabinet approved collectively and unanimously yesterday in order to deal with this matter. I will not have time to deal with the other elements of Deputy Ó Caoláin's question.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	Yesterday, we listened as the Fiscal Advisory Council stated that we must plough ahead with a further €2 billion of adjustments in this year's budget, on the basis that economic growth is uncertain and the national debt is alarmingly high. The idea of a further cut of €2 billion will strike terror into those who have already been ravaged by years of austerity.With the national debt figure standing at €203 billion, it is the understatement of the century to say it is alarmingly high. It is very much the elephant in the room and until it is addressed, we will constantly be putting out budgetary fires. We are now into budget season, with departmental meetings under way and groups publishing pre-budget submissions. The Taoiseach will dismiss many of those submissions as fantasy economics. Talking of fantasy economics, my attention is drawn to one of the commitments he gave in the lead-up to this year's local elections, namely, that Fine Gael councillors would reduce the property tax by 15%. Given what the Government has done with the Local Government Fund, is that commitment actually deliverable? There are three main streams of local authority funding. The first of these, the general purposes grant, has been reduced from €999 million six years ago to €275 million in 2014, notwithstanding the subvention of €490 million paid to Irish Water last year. The fund has been decimated. The next stream is commercial rates, and Fine Gael gave a pre-election commitment either to keep those rates static or reduce them.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	Does the Deputy have a question?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	The third funding stream is the property tax, which is essentially being used to replace the general purposes grant and is estimated to bring in €290 million in 2014. In a recent Sunday Business Post article, Michael Brennan outlined in graphic detail how only nine local authorities will have the capacity to fulfil the commitment to reduce the property tax by 15%.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	The Deputy is way over time.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	What analysis was done prior to the Taoiseach giving his commitment that Fine Gael councillors would reduce the tax by 15%, and will he publish that analysis? What measures will he now introduce to ensure the 15% reduction is at least possible? It seems to me that the only thing that can be done is to reverse the cut in the general purposes fund. Will the Taoiseach agree to do it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	I thank the Deputy for her questions. The Government published an agreed economic plan which set out specific targets to bring the deficit below 23% by 2015 and eliminate it by 2018. By balancing the books in 2018, we will no longer have to borrow to fund the day-to-day services provided by the State. This will make Ireland far more attractive for jobs and investment and keep our debt very much under control. I welcome, as does the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the input from the Fiscal Advisory Council, which was set up by the Government for a particular purpose. We agree that meeting the deficit target of under 3% next year is critical, and Government policy will reflect that. The Minister has pointed out on many occasions that this is the target and that an adjustment is required to reach it. We cannot say now what that adjustment will be because we have no final view of the national accounts until later in the year. It is too early to make a decision as to what the size of the adjustment will be. It is a lever to achieve the target that has been set out, but 90% of the adjustment has already been made. The Government's fiscal adjustment plans are in line with the requirements of the new fiscal framework. I am advised by the Department of Finance that the Government is not going beyond the minimum requirements of that framework, and I understand the Department will specifically query the conclusion the Fiscal Advisory Council has reached. The rules of the EU fiscal compact treaty require Ireland to attain our medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget by 2018. Under the treaty, the European Commission - not the Irish authorities, as suggested by the advisory council - sets out what it calls the calendar of convergence. Like other member states, Ireland is obliged to adhere to the EU fiscal rules, the objectives of which are to prevent a recurrence of the extreme crisis we experienced in recent years and ensure EU economies can grow and jobs can be created. The commitment the Fine Gael Party gave prior to the local elections was that its elected members would not vote for an increase in commercial rates and would reduce the property tax where that was possible, with a clear indication given that it would not, however, be possible in all cases. The newly elected councils are getting down to preparing their budgets for 2015. The commitment the Deputy referred to was very specific, namely, no increase in commercial rates, the possibility of reducing property taxes where possible and a recognition that such reduction would not be possible in all cases.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	The Taoiseach is saying that it is too early to say what the budgetary figures will be, but this did not stop him from making a promise which people took at face value. If one walked into a shop advertising a 15% reduction on all goods only to find there was just one small rail where that reduction applied, one would be a disappointed customer and probably would not return to the shop. This is the kind of thing that gives politics a bad name. The reality is that people heard the commitment given that Fine Gael councillors would deliver a 15% reduction in the property tax. In the autumn we will see local government pitched against national government, and the Taoiseach holds all the cards in that situation.

The Taoiseach is not giving people at local government level the possibility of effecting that cut. I have asked the Taoiseach if he will reverse the cut in the general purposes grant. Will he also give an absolute assurance that 80% of property taxes collected will be retained in the areas in which they are collected?

Some of the parties over there would say that this is not the time to introduce these charges, even though they were very much in favour of them in the past. I agree fully with the Deputy that this kind of politics gives everybody a bad name.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	We were very clear with our members before the local elections that they would not be voting for an increase in commercial rates and would reduce property charges where that is possible, while setting out clearly that it would not be possible in all cases. The Deputy asked whether 80% of property tax revenues will be retained in the areas in which they are collected. The taxes gathered in different parts of the country are dependent on property valuations in those locations and there is a variation in that. We want to ensure that no local authority is in a worse position then it was before. I thank the Deputy for her comment about people on the other side of the House giving politics a bad name. I agree with that.

The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 has been renewed annually and only cursory attention has been paid to it despite the fact this Act, in its original manifestation, was intended to be temporary, as on each of the renewals since. The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 continues to infringe on the judicial rights of suspects, and I emphasise the word "suspects". It is very important the provisions of this Act are properly addressed by this House and a 45 minute period of time would not allow that, either in this House or at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. Ultimately, this has to be revisited. It should be repealed as it has no place in the Ireland of today. I urge Government to grasp the nettle and not be afraid to tackle what is involved. It has to be done. It is due to years of not being willing to face up to this fact that this Government and previous Governments have allowed this odious legislation to continue unaddressed. I oppose the taking of the motion in this way, which has applied continuously.

As the date of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 suggests, it is a full 16 years ago. The draconian measures deemed appropriate at that time, but with which I disagreed, have, even by the standards of the Government, long since passed. There should be appropriate time for a much deeper and more meaningful discussion on the dangers of having this type of repressive draconian legislation on the Statute Book.

There are very good reasons this should be renewed on an annual basis and the Minister for Justice and Equality has put forward the view that this should apply again. This debate takes place every year. I remind Deputies Higgins and Ó Caoláin that there are people living on this island who want to destroy this State. Many of them have acquired a capacity for destruction that warrants the continuation of this order should it ever be required and for that reason, the Minister for Justice and Equality has made this recommendation. It has been an annual issue since 1998 and I strongly support it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	Yesterday, the Government’s statement on medical cards referred to interaction with the Attorney General on the Health Act 1970. The director general of the Health Service Executive, HSE, is satisfied the announcement will allow him to return cards to persons with an acute medical condition. The Minister of State, Deputy White, made it clear that legislation would be needed for the provision of discretionary medical cards to those with acute conditions. He based that on a new interpretation that arose over the past year or two that a card could be only allocated due to financial hardship. Magician-like, that interpretation has been waived and put to one side, for which I am glad, and 15,000 people will get back their discretionary medical cards. However, in the meantime, there are another 15,000 in limbo.

The promise was that there would be legislation before the summer to deal once and for all with medical needs and conditionality in the awarding of discretionary medical cards. Will such legislation be provided? What timeline is the Government offering in the enactment of such legislation to provide for the awarding of discretionary medical cards to people with acute medical condition or has the Government resiled from providing any such legislation? With the recent revelations about mother and baby homes, there is a significant issue around adoption and the adoption (tracing and information) Bill and people’s rights to tracing and access information to medical histories and so forth. When can we expect that legislation?

We have had discussions about this before and it is quite complex. The Bill is expected before the end of the year and discussions are well under way. With regard to medical cards, the law still stands from 1970. The cards were removed on an administrative basis and will be returned on an administrative basis.

I raise these in the context of the lock-out - call it what one will - by the Greyhound waste collection company yesterday of some 60 workers while negotiations were ongoing. Will he indicate when these Bills will present? Will they offer protection for workers who find themselves in that most unacceptable of situations?

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to allow for the provision of a home care package to a person who qualifies for and is being offered long-term residential care in circumstances where a suitable home care package can be devised for that person and such package is less costly on the State than the long-term residential care being offered and to provide for related matters.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to bring forward this Bill today. State policy is that elderly and infirm people should be catered for, in so far as possible, in the comfort and security of their own homes. If someone reaches the point at which they are too old or infirm to look after themselves, or for their family to look after them without support, there are two routes open to them. The first option is the fair deal scheme where someone goes into a nursing home, they pay the appropriate contribution and are supported by the State. The second option is a home-care package. As the fair deal is on a statutory basis, people have an absolute right to it if they fulfil the relevant criteria. The home-care package, alternatively, is on a discretionary basis. Unintentionally, State policy has directed more people to the fair deal scheme than should otherwise be the case. In other words, the balance is incorrect. Another issue with the home-care package is geographical. It depends on whether the various ingredients which make it up are available in the locality where the patient resides. Local health officials may determine that, because the necessary ingredients are not available in one locality, they have no option but to opt for the fair deal scheme. Ironically, in the age of austerity, it costs the State approximately three times as much to provide a fair deal package as it does to provide a home-care package.There are exceptions, but generally speaking it costs three times as much. What I propose is that if the home-care package were put on a statutory basis, whereby people meet certain criteria and have an absolute right to it, then more people would opt for the home-care package with a considerable saving to the Exchequer. Existing home-care services are sporadic and inconsistent. They are not patient driven and there are significant geographical disparities in the availability of services. Often it depends on where one happens to live. There is no transparency in eligibility criteria and decision-making. It is entirely at the discretion of the health service. As a result, many elderly infirm people have little choice but to opt for nursing home-care at far greater cost to the Exchequer. The ultimate solution to this is to amend the legislation providing for the fair deal to have a similar set of criteria for a home-care package. Obviously the health criteria should be the same, but the financial criteria would be different to reflect the various cost structures of looking after somebody in a nursing home as opposed to at home. We are drafting legislation to encompass this. In the meantime the Bill would provide a temporary solution, whereby if somebody is assessed for the fair deal he or she would have a right to request that a home-care package be put together, the health service would be compelled to put the home-care package together, and the patient would be entitled to receive it, as opposed to the fair deal, if it is cheaper to the State to provide it. This makes perfect sense and I do not see how the Government can oppose it. The Department of Health should take measures to bring forward similar legislation if I cannot get this through the system soon enough. It would present a considerable saving to the Exchequer and enable more people to be cared for in the comfort, security and safety of their own homes.

Having cut back on various costs and expenses, the single cost it cannot cut back is that of the payment of rates to the local authorities. On the other side, the local authorities have a very inflexible system without any clear definition. The history of the legislation goes back to 1838, with the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, and 15 other statutes also deal with the issue. The Bill attempts to give an opportunity to newly established small businesses to pay a reduced level of rate to the local authorities to give them an opportunity to start up and allow the cost of rates to be at least somewhat flexible. It would clear the way for the subsequent occupier clause. Under the Bill the occupier in possession would be dealt with rather than the landlord in terms of the rates due to a local authority. It would also allow a local authority to pursue the matter further through the courts to collect any rate which might be outstanding. The Bill deals with the issues which have emerged for local authorities and the person or company paying the rates, who are on either side of the argument. Given the fact the current method of collection is based on legislation dating back to 1838, the anomalies which exist, the pressures for businesses and with regard to costs, the matter needs to be reformed. The Bill also provides for a coherent mechanism for reviewing all aspects of the rating process and for the collection of rates. It is in line with the requirements of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Bill contains a number of sections. I ask the Government to examine the contents of the Bill and, if it is not happy with it, to bring forward a different Bill or create debate on the matter in order that the issues facing the SME sector and all those paying rates can be dealt with in such a way as to give them a break and give local authorities the flexibility to reduce rates and allow a uniform system throughout the country whereby rates can be reduced in cases where not all of a premises is being used relative to the size of a commercial property being used. The Bill also deals with the issue of licensing authorities and properties which are not rateable. Should such a property get a licence it becomes a rateable property. Anomalies such as this exist in the current system and nobody is able to get over them. Dealing with this issue is not rocket science. It is not something which needs to be delayed in any way with regard to the income from commercial rates for the Exchequer or local authorities. A balance can be struck between collecting enough money to provide services while not collecting them to the extent those paying rates are penalised. It is the biggest issue in business and I ask that it be addressed. If the Government is not bringing forward its own Bill I suggest it uses this Bill, with amendments, and allow it to go through the House.

As I was at a meeting for most of the morning, I was not aware of the arrangements and I apologise for being late. I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue for my constituency. I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and thank him for his attendance. The Minister is both aware of the position and is supportive of what I am about to say but I acknowledge there are difficulties in arriving at the desired outcome. This issue concerns the road coming into Adare, the N20 from Limerick to Kerry. The road into Adare has been named by AA Roadwatch as one of the country's worst in terms of traffic tailbacks. It appears in the list of seven of the country's slowest roads compiled by the Automobile Association, AA, based on its own experience and information from the Garda Síochána and bus companies. That is no surprise to the people of Adare, because tailbacks have been experienced for a number of years, which has caused delays for traffic coming into and leaving Adare. During bank holidays, two-mile tailbacks build up on the approach into Adare from the Kerry side as a result of people returning from holiday periods after the weekend. It happens both ways, but the problem is very serious at weekends, especially on Friday nights. It is no surprise to the people of Adare that it is on the list of the seven slowest areas compiled by the AA. I believe the Minister has some personal experience in this regard from his journeys to the south west. I wish to highlight a number of issues. Obviously, commuters going west experience great frustration. Many commuters who travel through Adare morning and evening are from the west of County Limerick but work in Limerick city and its environs. There is also a serious problem on the small country roads because of what are often referred to as rat-runs. Some time ago, a total of 133 people signed a petition calling for a speed limit on those roads but the council is not prepared to concede this because it is not a 24-hour issue. There are serious concerns about the safety of children and at certain periods, people cannot walk those county roads because of the traffic going west avoiding Adare. This has been a problem for more than 30 years. Several routes for a bypass have been identified over that period but we were extremely disappointed that An Bord Pleanála turned down the last route the council proposed, using the excuse that the motorway from Limerick to Cork is being delayed and it was to be part of the programme to establish that motorway.I make the case for a bypass for Adare because many other towns have been bypassed. Deputy Griffin will know that the bypass of Castleisland was done as a single project. In my opinion the bypass of Adare should be regarded as a stand-alone project and should not be connected with any future motorway to Cork. I was informed recently that the project has cost more than €5 million to date in providing plans and identifying various routes. Adare is a premier tourist project in the mid west which has been described as one of the prettiest villages in Ireland. There is great potential for the development of the tourism business in Adare and in the mid-west in general if the bypass is constructed.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue. Members will know that as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in this case, Limerick County Council. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. Due to the national financial position, public funding for Ireland's national roads has fallen radically since reaching a peak of €1.75 billion in 2007. The allocation to the NRA for improvement and maintenance works in 2014 is €371 million, including recent stimulus funding of €23 million, which is comparable to that available for national roads in 1998. This is where we are in terms of funding. The reality is that the available funds no longer match the amount of work required. For this reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects, including Adare. The main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years. Only a small number of new public private partnership projects can be taken to the construction stage for now. Turning to the issue of the Adare bypass in particular, the N21 Adare bypass route was intended to run to the south of Adare. The compulsory purchase order and environmental impact statement documentation was submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval on 4 March 2010, but on 18 October 2012, An Bord Pleanála made a decision to refuse the proposed road scheme to bypass Adare. Principally, although not exclusively, the An Bord Pleanála decision was based on the fact that the Adare bypass route:[would] if permitted and constructed, constitute isolated infrastructure, would not represent a coherent approach to the provision of major roads infrastructure and, furthermore, would not have the potential to fulfil the functions envisaged for the scheme. The proposed development would, therefore, be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.While I do not think anyone would argue that traffic is not an issue for the residents and businesses in Adare, given the rejection by An Bord Pleanála of the preferred route, the NRA and the local authority must now assess options on the basis of that decision. The scheme will have to revert to route selection stage and I understand that Limerick County Council has removed any planning restrictions on the southern route. Limerick County Council has recently appointed engineers to examine the various options for better connecting Foynes Port to the wider road network. This route selection report is expected to be completed before the end of the year and its impact on Adare can then be assessed. As the Deputy knows, I am concerned about the situation in Adare. I have visited the town many times and I have met the Deputy and Deputies Patrick O'Donovan and Niall Collins, the National Roads Authority and Limerick County Council to see if a way forward can be charted, bearing in mind the decision of An Bord Pleanála. One issue raised at that meeting was the need for preplanning application consultation with An Bord Pleanála for major road projects so that major issues can be flagged before plans are submitted. At present, there is no provision in either the Roads Acts or the Planning Acts for the NRA or roads authorities to enter into preplanning application consultations with An Bord Pleanála in relation to proposed road developments. However, the Planning Acts make provision for preplanning consultation with An Bord Pleanála for various other strategic infrastructure developments, including transport related projects such as railways, prior to the submission of a planning application. I am considering the inclusion of a Committee Stage amendment to the Roads Bill 2014 which will enable the NRA and road authorities to engage in preplanning consultations with An Bord Pleanála in respect of proposed road developments. This will provide the NRA or the road authority, as the case may be, with a formal mechanism to obtain the preliminary views and attitude of An Bord Pleanála with regard to a proposed road development before submitting an application to the board for approval under section 51 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended.

The Minister has informed us of the difficulties associated with the preplanning discussions with An Bord Pleanála, and I welcome his decision to amend the Roads Bill 2014 as he promised. I wish to underline the urgent need for the project to be carried out independently of any other project, just as has been the case for many other projects. There is a serious situation with regard to commuter traffic in the village. I know that many Members on their way to Kerry, including Deputy Griffin, have experienced serious delays in Adare. It is very frustrating for those who want to develop the tourist projects in Adare and for the people who live in Adare because the enjoyment of their village is inhibited by the presence of the level of traffic passing through Adare. It is very difficult to understand that one of the most serious bottlenecks in planning is one of the prettiest villages in Ireland and that the tourist product and the businesses of Adare are inhibited from developing because of a situation that has continued for 30 years. We look forward to the Bill being amended and to engaging in preplanning discussions. As the Minister stated previously, we met the various authorities and my constituency colleagues to find a solution to what is a serious traffic management problem in my constituency.

I do not know the exact cost of the project to date but I will ask my office to contact the Deputy with the information. I share Deputy Neville's sense of urgency with regard to this project. Adare is a beautiful tourist village. It is a lovely place to stay and to stop and it would be even nicer if not for all the traffic going through it. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy. It would also be of significant benefit to people travelling to and from County Kerry if this bottleneck could be addressed. However, in my opinion it is right to carry out the study rather than looking at Adare in isolation because one of the reasons given by An Bord Pleanála for its refusal was that the bypass was considered as an isolated development. Therefore, to satisfy An Bord Pleanála we should not consider it in isolation but rather consider it in the context of other road projects in the area, including Foynes. Once that work is completed by the end of the year, we should be able to come up with a solution for Adare and at that point I will strongly encourage the NRA to proceed with planning so that if and when the money becomes available for construction, we will be ready to commence. That is my plan of action in that regard.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for discussion and the Minister for attending in person. I apologise on behalf of Deputy Joe McHugh for his absence; he has been unavoidably detained elsewhere. It would be remiss of me not to commend Deputy Dan Neville on raising a matter that is related to the issue I am raising to the extent that access to County Kerry is hampered by shortcomings in the road network. Bottlenecks in Adare, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale, for example, make road access to the county difficult and increase journey times. It is vital, therefore, that County Kerry retains its air link with Dublin, the main hub connecting us with the rest of the world. Similarly, Donegal does not have a great road network and needs to retain flights to the capital. The Minister was the first member of Cabinet I met following my election to the Dáil in 2011. At that meeting, we discussed the need to continue flights between Kerry and Dublin beyond 2011 and the Minister, to his great credit, subsequently decided to maintain the air link between counties Kerry and Donegal and the capital. These services provide an economic lifeline for both counties. I welcome the Minister's recent decision to place the service provided on both routes out to tender once the current public service obligation contracts expire in November.  The purpose of raising this topic is to ascertain the current position, including the plans for the routes and the timeline anticipated for realising them. People are concerned that, with the current contract set to expire in November, there may be a hiatus during which flights between Dublin and counties Kerry and Donegal will cease. Will the Minister assure the House that every effort is being made prevent such a scenario? Kerry Airport has a significant impact on the county and I am sure if Deputy McHugh were present, he would make a similar point with regard to Donegal Airport. Kerry Airport employs 50 people directly and a further 53 people indirectly. The staff payroll amounts to more than €500,000, which goes into the local economy. The air link between County Kerry and Dublin should not be viewed in isolation as it makes the airport viable. It is this viability that has attracted flights from London, Luton and Frankfurt Hahn and a service, primarily outbound, to Faro in Portugal. These international flight connections have a significant impact on the local economy. I have met large numbers of visitors from the United Kingdom and Germany, primarily in summer, many of whom told me that the availability of the air link was the reason for their visit to County Kerry. Most of them would not otherwise visit the county and they spend substantial sums locally. Kerry Airport is a vital lifeline for the county, which must be maintained and developed. Last week, I contacted Ryanair to ask whether it had plans to establish new routes from the airport, particularly to the north of the United Kingdom with which we do not have a link. If possible, I would also like a transatlantic route established at the airport at some point. I ask the Minister to provide an update on the current position and commend him again on the support he has shown for Kerry Airport. I know he wants what is best for the airport. Any support or information he can provide will be appreciated.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	Under the Regional Airports Programme 2011-2014, Exchequer support for regional airports is provided under a number of schemes, including a public service obligation, PSO, air services subvention. This programme reflects the outcome of the 2010 value for money review of Exchequer expenditure on the regional airports programme. Following the review, a decision was taken to reduce to two the number of routes covered by the PSO air services scheme. The Exchequer provides supports under the scheme to Aer Arann-Stobart Air for the Kerry to Dublin route and Loganair for the Donegal to Dublin route. The review took account of a number of factors, including the performance of the services, the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources, improvements to the road network and changes in European Union legislation covering PSO air services. The decision to maintain the PSO air services to counties Kerry and Donegal had regard to the fact that the former is not yet connected to the major interurban motorway network as the Ballyvourney-Macroom road is not complete and the latter is not connected to either the motorway or rail network. Exchequer funding for PSO air services schemes provides financial support to airlines, based on a competitive tender, to operate essential services serving peripheral or development regions. These services are considered vital for the economic development of the regions in question and would not be provided on a commercial basis. Under the current contract, which ends in November, a total of almost €12 million will have been paid to Aer Arann-Stobart Air in respect of the Dublin to Kerry route and more than €10 million will have been paid to Loganair in respect of the Dublin to Donegal route over the lifetime of the respective contracts. Regional airports were developed in the 1980s to provide for improved connectivity both nationally and internationally. However, the development of the major interurban roads programme and improvements to the rail network in the intervening period have reduced the importance of regional airports for connectivity within Ireland. Today, regional airports are largely viewed as being important because of a level of international connectivity that they bring to a region for tourism and business. Arising from the Ireland West Airport Knock study, the Government decided to continue the funding for regional airports under a new post-2014 programme, which is being developed in my Department. This is in line with the draft national aviation policy which will be finalised in the coming months. The new programme will have to comply with the revised European Union guidelines on state aid which came into effect in April this year. While the 2014 EU guidelines on state aid to airports and airlines have application to other Union guidelines on state aid, the current PSO air services scheme and any future air services schemes must comply in particular with Regulation (EC) No. 1008/2008. These regulations require that a notice of invitation to tender must be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, with a deadline of two months for submission of tenders from the date of publication of the notice. It is planned to hold shortly a new PSO air services competition, that is, a public tender process, for the Donegal to Dublin and Kerry to Dublin routes post-2014. As part of this process, it is planned to extend the current contracts to next February to ensure continuity of service pending the outcome of the tender process. It is expected that a limited budget of some €12 million per annum will be available for current and capital expenditure under the regional airports programme from 2015 onwards. With an average cost per annum for the two PSO routes from Kerry and Donegal of more than €7.5 million per annum based on existing figures, a final decision on whether to maintain both routes post-2014 will be taken when the cost of subvention becomes clear from the tenders submitted.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	I thank the Minister for his response and welcome the extension by three months of the current contracts. As I stated, I was fearful that, with the clocks ticking, time could run out before a new arrangement was put in place. The extension is, therefore, a welcome development. While I welcome the commitment to further examine the issue, the Government's approach must take account of factors other than the immediate cost of the subsidy for services on the Kerry to Dublin and Donegal to Dublin routes, including the wider benefits to the economy. I referred to tourism but I note also that a large number of international companies, including FEXCO, the Kerry Group and Liebherr, are based in the county. Their executives and clients use the PSO route frequently to connect with Dublin and the rest of the world. If we wish to attract foreign direct investment to County Kerry, particularly now that it will be on the regional aid map again from 1 July onwards, it is crucial that air connectivity is maintained. I thank the Minister for providing for an extension to the services to ensure flights do not cease on 1 November. I ask him to do everything in his power and to be as flexible as possible to secure new operators for the Dublin to Kerry and Dublin to Donegal air routes. As I indicated, the Government must consider the matter in the context of the overall economic impact of the routes, as opposed to their immediate costs to the State.Of that subsidy, €600,000 goes back into the Dublin Airport Authority, a State body, through airport charges alone. It is not all one gross expenditure figure. There is a lot of that coming back in to the State directly as well.

The Deputy makes some valid points. Government decisions should take account of not only the simple narrow balance sheet but also the wider economic benefits that derive from air connections, whether they be tourism, investment or business. He is, of course, correct to say that there are benefits for Dublin Airport as well as Kerry and Donegal in that landing fees are charged and the routes from Donegal and Kerry help to feed routes from Dublin to Britain, Europe and other parts of the world and make them more sustainable. That is true. Notwithstanding all of that, the budget for regional airports is €12 million a year and, unfortunately, I do not expect that to increase. Of that, approximately €7.5 million goes on those two PSO routes and I do not expect that to increase either. I am not in a position to write any blank cheques to anyone at this stage. We need to see what tenders come in. If I can give any signal from here, it is that we expect the airlines to put forward good value propositions so we can continue these routes well into 2015 and beyond.

When I saw Deputy Penrose in the House, I was sure that Topical Issue No. 3 would be taken in its proper sequence. I apologise to the Minister, Deputy Hogan. I understand that it is the Minister's intention not to fund directly any national networks under the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, which is the successor of the Local and Community Development Programme. We, in the previous Government, decided that there were certain issues that needed to be dealt with on a national basis - Travellers, women's issues, island issues - and we recognised that in some cases the local approach only did not fit the bill. I was surprised to hear that it is intended not to make the €1.3 million, and the programme, available to the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks. Given there are 17 projects, this €1.3 million is quite a modest amount. It would amount to €76,000 on average per group, including the national office. The collective funds essential networks for women in the most disadvantaged of the communities. It is fair to say that we are not doing enough to tackle disadvantage. When I was Minister, it always amazed me that I could get plenty of notice for rural issues and island issues, but when one talked about urban disadvantage it was difficult to generate any interest from the media for the plight of those living in disadvantaged communities. If I might say so, women, in particular, in disadvantaged communities, face considerable challenges and are often the subject of significant disadvantages. I ask the Minister to revisit his decision and recognise that some things are done better with a dedicated national programme, that the idea of incorporating the collective into the new SICAP will not work because in each of the areas in which there is one of these women's networks he is depending on the local bidder to put an equivalent programme in place with equivalent funding. I do not think that will happen. A important service serving a huge range of people will lose out. I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision and continue to provide the service to the 36,589 women who have been benefiting from this service and who, in my view, will not get the same service in the new arrangement. When a good suggestion is made, it is good to listen. I compliment the Minister's colleague, Deputy Rabbitte. When this Dáil came together, there was a debate for an hour and a half on the oil and gas exploration sector and I suggested that we put the matter to good analysis in an Oireachtas committee. The committee put forward a comprehensive report, including new oil and gas terms. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, he announced today that he will implement substantially the recommendations of that all-party committee, including Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn Féin and Independents, and change gas exploration. We must learn in this Dáil that if a suggestion is good, no matter from where its comes, as Deputy Rabbitte certainly accepted, it should be taken on board.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	257	I always have taken on board good suggestions from all sides of the House whenever I deemed them to be good suggestions. Sometimes the problem is who is to be the arbiter of the good suggestion. As Deputy Ó Cuív will be aware, I have an open mind on matters.The proposals outlined in the Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government seek to position local government as the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level. I thought Deputy Ó Cuív would welcome that development concerning a democratic input at local level. The proposals are leading in terms of economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees or LCDCs are being established in all local authority areas. These committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP. They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore. I know that Deputy Ó Cuív will welcome that because he started the process himself.  In accordance with the public spending code, best practice internationally, legal advice and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the SICAP is subject to a public procurement process. The process is a competitive one that is open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations, such as the National Collective of Community Based Women's Network, NCCWN, that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme. On the contrary, therefore, I am not withdrawing funding. I am giving an opportunity for all the groups I have just mentioned to tender for the SICAP programme. The process comprises two stages. Stage 1 is currently underway. At stage 2 the LCDCs will procure the programme locally. Applicants at stage 1 must demonstrate that they meet the criteria for the delivery of services in the lot or lots applied for. Joint applications are encouraged and organisations of varying sizes - for example, smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations - are invited to submit joint applications. Partner candidates have a role in the delivery and implementation of the programme. All such partner candidates must be identified in the qualification questionnaire and a contracting arrangement may be required between the lead candidate and any partner candidates. Candidates may rely on the resources of other entities in order to establish the suitability requirements on condition that they can prove to the satisfaction of Pobal that they will have these resources at their disposal when necessary. All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified within the application documentation and any contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of bids received from qualifying applicants from stage one. Pobal is assisting my Department and the LCDCs in the preparation of tender documentation and the assessment criteria which will form part of stage 2. The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest under stage one of the process is 12 noon on 11 July 2014. I am not withdrawing any funding, therefore, but am putting the programme out to tender.

Tenders must be submitted, and can only be considered, on a county-by-county basis and only for the delivery of the programme in its entirety. It is not possible for the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks, NCCWN, to tender for this programme either nationally or to deliver women-specific programmes. It is disingenuous to say that the new system is the same as the old one, except that the Minister is putting it out to tender. There is also a question over whether it was necessary to put this out to tender. The Minister will say that he received legal advice but I understand that subsequent to that advice the EU introduced a new regulation whereby social programmes do not have to go out to tender. The legal advice might be out of date, so that issue should be revisited.  The Minister could have had a national tender for certain programmes that are better delivered nationally. He makes great play of the fact that he is localising everything, yet he is the Minister with responsibility for Uisce Éireann. I am not arguing with him on this basis because one must take it case by case. The Minister argued cogently - as I would argue concerning Travellers', women's and islanders' programmes - that rather than doing them on an area basis and making the component parts so weak as to have no say, it would be much better to do certain things nationally.  I am asking the Minister once again to re-tender some national programmes for women, islanders and Travellers, which are specific cohorts that require a national programme.

When the Attorney General gave him legal advice, he did not ignore it. There was no prospect of achieving anything unless one proceeded on the basis of law. We must adhere to competition law. The National Collective of Community Based Women's Network, NCCWN, is the umbrella organisation of the 17 community development projects which focus on disadvantaged women. It is possible, if they partner with others, to be able to tender for this process. We are not withdrawing funding. It receives funding under my Department's LCDC programme, as the Deputy knows. I do not know where the Deputy is getting this misinformation. I wish to clarify that my Department has not notified any of the 17 projects, including the NCCWN, of any intention to withdraw LCDC funding from their organisations. Deputy Ó Cuív should advise the people who are in touch with him to ensure that they tender for the project and enter into partnerships, if they must in order to do so.  The public procurement process for the new programme is competitive and legally sound. I am obliged to do it and it is open to the local development companies to get on with the job.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue which is a vital topic for debate on the floor of Dáil Éireann. The PSO levy has had a serious impact on a series of end users of electricity. The levy was introduced by the government in 2000 to ensure that Ireland had a percentage of indigenous electricity generation, peat resources principally from Bord na Móna, and also to encourage development of green energy in the form of wind and biomass. It was also introduced to have security of supply from the Aughinish and Tynagh power stations, which became relevant in the context of the reduction of the ESB monopoly. It was to guarantee new operators an income in the new markets. The PSO levy is reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation each year and the levy is set according to the various formulae laid down in the original directive from government. In this context the proposed decision paper for the PSO levy for 2014-15 was published on 6 June.  The crux of the problem is that despite everybody's involvement in growing the competitiveness of domestic industry, and the clearly uncompetitive nature of the Irish electricity market, it appears all consumers - domestic, industrial and business ones - are again facing into significant and savage price increases. It is noted that large energy users are bearing a disproportionate percentage of the price increase sought: 47% for domestic users as against 80.5% for large energy users.  While the policy was introduced and designed to support laudable national objectives at the time, it has now become a millstone around the neck of Irish industry. It is threatening the sustainability of many jobs across the economy and is becoming a barrier to the entry of new industries, data centres and the knowledge economy which are highly reliant on competitive electricity prices.  This flies in the face of the continuous focus by Forfás on competitiveness and the fact that it disadvantages us economically as a country in this vital component of international competition. Large energy users are bearing the brunt of the cost of this levy. In 2014-15, if left unchanged, the contribution to the fund by large energy users will rise to no less than 80.52%. On a four-year look back when the country was in the grip of its greatest ever recession, the contribution to the fund by large energy users rose by no less than 242%. In 2010-11, the fund stood at €156 million but is now a staggering €327 million. In just four short years, the fund has risen by 209%, which is an astronomical rise by any standards. We are aware of where the funds are used, so perhaps it is time to take a closer look at the PSO since the market is radically different from the one that existed when the levy was originally introduced. The Minister knows my view that wind energy turbines are the most monstrous blot on our landscape, being neither efficient nor effective. They are driven by corporate greed and a dismissive approach by those involved. This industry has had its subsidy, via the levy, increased from €9.73 million to €87.8 million in just four years. It is no wonder that armed with this levy, which is provided by consumers at all levels who have no choice in the matter, wind energy promoters think they can do what they like without any care for people's concerns. This proportion of the levy increased by 295%.However, we still appear to be hell bent on increasing the number of wind farms across our landscape, for which we will no doubt have to pay a further increase in the PSO levy. Are these great wind farms cost competitive and does this policy offer value for money? I say it does not. A large user of energy in my constituency will have to pay an increase in the PSO contribution of 80.52%. For this company, which employs more than 250 people directly and indirectly, the increase could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It operates in the export market, competing with Spain, Germany, England and the Benelux countries, all of which enjoy significantly lower energy costs and, in some cases, provide specific reliefs against high energy costs to their own companies. As a high level energy user, the PSO levy means that the company's overall electrical bill will rise by 4%, which will increase its energy bills by an estimated €250,000. As it competes in the markets to which I referred, it is not in a position to pass on the proposed price increases to their customers. How is the company going to survive and what impact will the increase have on workers and their families in this real life scenario? If this economy is to survive and grow, businesses must be competitive. If we continue with the PSO levy in its current format, the inefficient generators may survive but energy users clearly will not and we will not be able to attract the data centres needed for the knowledge economy or persuade other high level operators to remain here. The outlook could be bleak in this challenging and competitive environment unless we change tack and remodel the PSO levy from its current structure. Competitiveness is the key to our survival.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	I apologise to Deputy Penrose and the House for missing my slot. I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The PSO is charged to all domestic and business customers and is designed to compensate suppliers for the additional costs they incur by meeting obligations to purchase electricity from indigenous, sustainable and renewable sources, and to ensure security of supply. Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and its operation is outlined in SI 217 of 2002. The cost of the PSO levy tends to be lower during periods when fossil fuel prices are higher. In these circumstances the market sufficiently rewards renewable and indigenous peat producers. Deputy Penrose will be familiar with the most enduring function of the PSO, namely, to support employment in the peat sector in the midlands. The retention of hundreds of jobs in the midlands would not be viable without the PSO mechanism. Successive Governments have supported the PSO for that reason. A further legacy issue is the contract entered into in 2005 to ensure security of supply with Tynagh and Aughinish, at a time when the country was on a knife edge in terms of energy security. This is something we must guard against in the future. The existence of the PSO is vital to the delivery of our renewable energy targets. The PSO has supported the connection of around 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and it will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that we can meet our target of boosting renewable penetration to 40% by 2020. Any call for a review of the public service obligation should consider the importance of delivering our policy objectives of increased renewables and ensuring security of supply. It is also important to have due regard for regulatory stability in the context of overall energy policy, as I point out in the Green Paper. The biggest driver for the proposed levy rise for 2014-15 is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is currently estimated to be around 10% lower than last year. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover the allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by the lower international gas prices in evidence since spring 2014. This drives up the proposed PSO levy but if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained for the coming months, it will help to reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. This should enable suppliers to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. Electricity prices are de-regulated and the Commission for Energy Regulation will continue to actively monitor suppliers and the retail market generally. While remuneration of renewable electricity generation adds to the PSO levy and customer bills, it should be noted that wind also tends to reduce the wholesale price of electricity because the operating cost of wind power is close to zero. Renewable generation therefore displaces fossil fuel generation. This is especially the case when fossil prices are high and associated thermal generation is expensive to run. I am no less concerned than the Deputy about rising costs to industry and households alike. In the context of the increase in the PSO levy I have written to the Commissioners for Energy Regulation. As the main reason for the increase in the levy is a decrease in wholesale electricity prices, I have asked the regulator to be vigilant in its market monitoring function and to ensure that the reduction in the wholesale price of electricity is passed on to consumers. Otherwise I would expect the independent regulator to take further investigative action to discover why the deregulated market is not working competitively. Finally, it is worth noting that the current decision is a proposed decision by the regulator. The regulator may use a revised figure for the wholesale electricity price in the final decision paper if forecast fuel prices change for 2014-15. The final decision on the PSO levy for 2014-15 will be published before 1 August. Changes in the forecast wholesale price will affect the amount of the PSO levy, increasing it if the forecast wholesale price falls and reducing it if the wholesale price rises. I urge anyone concerned to make a submission to the regulator on this draft decision by the deadline of 4 July 2014.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I am acutely aware of the reason for the levy but we cannot continue to foist charges on industrial and domestic consumers. If the estimated wholesale price of electricity in the all-island market falls by 9% or 10%, the savings should be passed on to the consumer and end user but there is a peculiar anomaly in that, as the Minister pointed out, lower wholesale prices result in plants needing additional PSO subsidies to cover their costs and offset the smaller amounts they will receive on the market. This applies across the board both for renewables and peak energy security and supply. That is the biggest single driver of the increase in the proposed levy. The estimated wholesale price for the next year may be reflected in monthly trends of lower spot and forward prices in the single energy market but in a normal market when a company's revenue declines it seeks to offset the losses by lowering input costs and engaging in cost reduction strategies. Has the Commission for Energy Regulation carried out an investigation to ensure this occurs and, if so, can it provide proof that it has carried out such an exercise and who is overseeing value for money? The Minister made a strong argument but it can be countered by the fact that many large energy users purchase energy in advance rather than on a day-to-day basis. If a company has contracted forward until the end of 2015 or 2016, short-term energy decreases will not be of benefit. We are in a new environment and we have to review how it operates. Electricity costs are a major factor in competitiveness, as the Minister is aware. A Forfás report focused on this issue. It is not sustainable to increase a levy by 250% over four years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	I share the Deputy's concerns, and I expressed them at a meeting with the regulator and subsequently put them in writing. When one considers the three elements of the PSO, the largest element of cost is attributable to the peat stations in the midlands. It would not be viable to maintain employment in the midlands, such as among Bord na Móna workers, without the PSO.Deputy Penrose will be interested to know that the Edenderry power station will cease to receive compensation from the levy from the end of 2015. Given that it is due to receive €20.6 million, it is a significant factor, although it is not as significant as the contract running out next year with Tynagh and Aughinish. For 2014 and 2015, Tynagh and Aughinish account for €77.6 million of the levy. That was a ten-year contract entered into by the then Government in 2005, and as I noted in my formal remarks, the country was then on a knife edge at the height of the boom with regard to energy security. We are now heading into the last year of that contract, and that is a large element. Deputy Penrose is correct about forward purchase contracts. The public service obligation, PSO, increases when the wholesale price comes down and in those circumstances large energy users should be able to arrange forward purchase contracts to take advantage of the fact that wholesale prices have decreased. In any event, the PSO as we have known it is in the final straight. Edenderry will be affected from the end of 2015 and the legacy contracts with Tynagh and Aughinish have one year left to run.

Some of the old sayings hold true in this modern society, and one is "if it is not broken, do not fix it." The system is not broken and An Post is working, although it may be able to do things better. Why should we interfere with the position of An Post, which is contained within primary legislation? I cannot see how, as the Minister has argued, the position of An Post can be strengthened by its removal from primary legislation. At the very least, we should reconsider the existing legislation. I accept that An Post is uniquely placed to compete for the contract in future but that will not necessarily always be the case, and it may depend on its investments. It does not have a great track record of considering banking facilities. I have argued that An Post should be a "preferred bidder" and the Minister has concerns about the use of a preferred status for An Post in legislation because the EU may come down hot and heavy because of competition law. There is a social good that must be protected in the event of the EU demanding that services delivered by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection be interfered with because of competition issues. I welcome the provisions in the section that would give clarity to the powers of An Post in helping the Department deal with fraud and taking the public services card from people who do not own one or are using it fraudulently. Such provisions are in the Bill but there are already ways in which this can be done. It is just a matter of putting a phone call to An Garda Síochána, and it is fraud if somebody uses another person's identity for such purposes. I have major concerns about lining up public services for privatisation. We even heard with Topical Issues about another area where public services are being outsourced. It was a Progressive Democrats mantra that the public service should have been outsourced or privatised and the Minister has started that ball rolling with JobPath. I hope the Minister will be proven right in her comments about An Post being protected forever but I do not believe that. Unless it is in legislation and the company retains its current standing, it will have no protection different to any other company which wants to compete for that business.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	273	When people approved us joining the EU, they did so because they thought they would get many benefits from the EU from a social perspective with regard to trade union activities, job security and cheaper access to goods. Europe had a social reputation related to the services provided in health, education, transport and right across the board. It was reflected in the vote for the European elections that people are beginning to see it is not there to protect the interests of people but rather to protect the interests of big companies that have the ear of the European Council every day of the year. This smacks of such ideas. We must start to put social costs on the European agenda, as every country has a nuanced culture with different services requiring protection. Removing An Post from the primary legislation will have an impact on how it must compete against big companies which function for competitive reasons rather than providing a service to the community. I do not accept the Minister's comments and I support putting this amendment to a vote.

In other words, Deputies are trying to raise a fear in the minds of the postmasters and particularly elderly customers who rely on An Post for the services with which we are all familiar. I have voiced the concern before that Deputies are frightening people a little too much. An Post has the contract until December 2019 if it wishes to keep to it. I do not run An Post but it won the contract for two years, with the option to renew for four years. Instead of congratulating An Post on winning the contract, Deputies are trying to sow a doubt. They are implying that winning the contract - a success for An Post - is somehow a failure. The Deputies cannot have it both ways. The Deputies have argued they are madly in favour of An Post but Deputy Ó Snodaigh in particular on Committee Stage seemed to want to force people to take payments from An Post. It is not possible to force people with bank accounts to go to the local post office and form a queue.

People have choices and many have bank accounts. They may not be in a position to go to a local post office so consumer choice comes into the issue.What I said in that context was that perhaps some of the Deputies here would put their minds to thinking about how An Post could successfully compete and get involved, for instance, in electronic fund transfers because the biggest disadvantage for An Post is that it does not have the equivalent of a bank account. It has a savings deposit account system, which has worked very well for it and is very popular but it does not have a banking system that allows for remote banking facilities. That is the challenge for An Post in the future.

The Department of Social Protection and I as Minister have specified that we want people collecting jobseeker's payments to go to An Post in person to guard against fraud. That is an extremely important part of the service that An Post provides for the Department. Some of what the Deputies suggest would endanger An Post's success in winning the contract because it comes very close to saying not only could An Post become the preferred bidder in an open competition, which is in effect what happened once the tendering and competition process got under way, but also that European competition law and a previous ruling of the court should be pretty much set aside to provide for An Post being the only company. That is not allowed under EU competition law.

Of course we congratulate An Post on winning the contract. What sort of a red herring is that? It is a smoke screen to say we did not congratulate An Post. Why does the Minister regard it as necessary to change the legislation? I have already pointed out that the contract cannot be challenged on any new basis because one does not change the legislation. If the contract was to be challenged it would be on the basis that An Post was specifically mentioned in the 2005 legislation. The contract was granted before this new amending legislation came in. What is the necessity for changing the legislation? What is the hidden agenda here?

Any employer who has had a finding made against them of unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, must reimburse to the State the cost of the unfairly dismissed former employee’s social welfare payments from the date of the dismissal up to the decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.”.It is a pity we were unable to discuss some of the previous amendments, but that is the nature of the game. I have made this proposal on a number of occasions. I have submitted an amendment of this type in the context of a number of social welfare Bills. I am making this positive proposal at a time when the State is trying to recover everything that is due to it. When a worker who has been unfairly dismissed wins a case at the Employment Appeals Tribunal and gets an award, a deduction is made by the State from the person's social welfare payment but the money in question is not recovered from the employer who should have been paying this person.In other words, the person has enjoyed the benefit of the social welfare payment, but the State is never reimbursed by the employer. It is difficult to calculate how much might be recouped to the State under this provision, but the volume of cases going to the Employment Appeals Tribunal has been increasing substantially in recent years. In 2008, for example, 5,457 cases were submitted to the tribunal, but this had increased to 6,000 by 2010. These figures suggest that the Exchequer could be losing out to the tune of several million euro. I estimate the loss at between €2 million and possibly as high as €10 million given the delays in hearing cases at the tribunal, but I will err on the side of caution by opting for the lower figure. In the current climate, a person who has been unfairly dismissed may well struggle to find alternative work and will instead be dependent on social welfare. Where an unfair dismissal claim is upheld, the individual will receive compensation for loss of earnings. Why should the State not also be compensated for the cost of supporting that person through the period of unemployment? Unfortunately, it seems the State is eager to recover moneys from social welfare recipients, as we discussed on Committee Stage, but not to pursue employers for the costs of supporting employees who are unfairly dismissed. There might even be a case for applying the provision in the amendment retrospectively. Even if that is not possible, I urge the Minister to accept it and ensure the State is compensated in future in such cases. If she is not inclined to accept the amendment, I ask that she consider it for inclusion in the next Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	This is a good amendment. Under the new section 38B of the principal Act, which the Minister is inserting by way of section 7 of the Bill, we will have a new system of recouping moneys owed to the State by employers. Deputy Ó Snodaigh is seeking to do something similar. In a situation where an individual is waiting for an unfair dismissal case to be heard, he or she will probably be entitled to jobseeker's benefit for the duration. Where the tribunal decides in that person's favour and awards due compensation, why should the State be at a loss in the amount of the jobseeker's benefit it was obliged to pay out for months or even possibly a year or more because of the proved illegal actions of the employer? The latter should be liable to reimburse the State in such circumstances.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	I support this amendment. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh observed, we have seen an increase in unfair dismissal cases in recent years, with the workers involved often finding themselves in a very difficult situation as they wait for their case to be heard. In the past 24 hours, workers at Greyhound, a waste disposal company, have been locked out of their work premises. Their employer has not said that they are sacked or issued P45s; they have no idea what is happening. They have had a case against their employer at the Labour Court since February, but when they presented for work at 6 a.m. yesterday morning, they were told they had to sign a new contract or they would have no job. They refused to sign that contract, which involved agreeing to new work practices and a 35% cut in their wages. These drivers earn €636 per week, so a 35% reduction would bring their earnings down to €426. These are men with families and financial commitments and they cannot afford to take that type of pay cut. They have taken their case to the courts and engaged with the company's chief executive officer, Michael Buckley. The latter took a unilateral action yesterday in refusing to let them go into work. He is saying it is not a lock-out, but he had replacement workers organised and ready to go. These new workers were waiting to be collected at Woodie's DIY store on the Naas Road and were put to work collecting bins within half an hour. It seems they had already been trained and had undergone health and safety instruction and so on. It is an absolute disgrace. Another issue of concern regarding this case is that parts of its waste collection routes have been subcontracted out by Greyhound. We have been informed that the subcontractor collects workers in the Woodie's carpark, puts them in the bin trucks with instructions to cover a very large route and goes off for the rest of the day. Constituents have told us that Greyhound trucks have been collecting bins at 11.30 p.m., midnight or even 1 a.m., as a result of which complaints have been made to the local authority. What seems to be happening is that the subcontractor is keeping these workers out as late as it takes to complete the route in order to ensure the subcontractor's bonus is secured. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection should take this issue seriously. It is possible the subcontractor is employing these workers illegally - I have no information in that regard, but it warrants investigation. Meanwhile, the permanent Greyhound employees are in limbo, with no P45s issued and the word coming from management that their jobs are there waiting for them if they sign the new contract. However, that contract is still under negotiation with SIPTU. This is a very serious issue and one worker ended up in hospital yesterday. Inexperienced people are being taken on to do the work of the permanent employees who came from Oxigen and South Dublin City Council under the transfer of undertakings seven years ago. We may well be looking at a major case of unfair dismissal here. This type of thing is happening more and more, including in Ballyfermot where a group of sacked workers - also SIPTU members - were told they must wait months before their case is heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. There should be an intervention in this matter and an investigation into what is going on. There is a broader issue here in regard to waste management, which I accept is not the Minister's remit but that of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I intend to raise it with him. Deputy Clare Daly and I have submitted this issue for discussion on the Topical Issue debate yesterday and today but it has not been taken. It is an urgent employment and social protection issue and I hope it will be taken tomorrow.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	While I do not propose to accept this amendment, I acknowledge that Deputy Ó Snodaigh has raised a valid issue. There are potential consequences arising from the proposal which would have to be examined in regard to payments currently being made to workers who have been unfairly dismissed. Under the Unfair Dismissals Act, which is not within the remit of my Department, a case may be taken to the rights commissioners service of the Employment Appeals Tribunal if a person feels that he or she has been unfairly dismissed from employment. Where an unfair dismissal case is upheld, redress can take the form of an appropriate reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for the financial loss involved. The Deputy is proposing that the wrongdoer, namely, the employer, would be obliged to compensate all of those impacted by that wrongdoing. This would involve the employer having to provide redress not only to the unfairly dismissed employee, but also to the Minister for Social Protection for any costs incurred as a consequence of the wrongdoing. Broadly similar arrangements are provided for under the new recovery of benefits arrangements that apply in regard to personal injury claims, as provided for in sections 13 and 14 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013. It is not exactly the same situation but there is a parallel. These arrangements, which are due to come into operation on 1 August, require the compensator to refund the Minister for Social Protection any relevant social welfare benefits that were paid as a result of personal injuries up to the date of the award of compensation.The recovery of benefits arrangements avoids double compensation being paid to the injured party in respect of the same personal injuries through compensation for loss of earnings and the payment of social welfare benefits. As I understand it, the Unfair Dismissals Act specifically precludes the reduction of any awards for financial loss arising out of an unfair dismissal in regard to social welfare benefits paid as a result of the dismissal. This contrasts with the treatment of earnings from employment in the case of a dismissed employee who subsequently gets another job in calculating the financial loss arising out of an unfair dismissal. In such circumstances, the Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal can offset the earnings from that job. Therefore, any proposal to oblige employers to reimburse social welfare payments paid as a result of an unfair dismissal would also have implications for the continuation of this double compensation being paid to certain dismissed employees. I presume the Deputy is aware of that.  As the operation of the unfair dismissals legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the impact of any proposals along the lines envisaged in this amendment would need to be examined by his Department in the first instance. I will undertake to communicate with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at a formal interdepartmental level and get the views of the Minister and the Department on the proposal. As I said when the Deputy raised this on a previous occasion, the Department of Social Protection took over the payments arising from redundancy and insolvency and, as a consequence, we have upgraded the IT platform. Deputies will be aware that the waiting period in regard to redundancy and insolvency claims has been vastly reduced. It is now possible to process them quite quickly. However, we are only responsible for the administration. The legislation rests with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but I am open to examining it and I will undertake to communicate with the Minister.  Perhaps the committee might arrange a further discussion and invite in the Minister or the officials from that Department to give their views on the issue. Perhaps it could do that in the autumn to give them some time to have a look at the background to this. I will also look at the comments made on financial costs and so on because there is merit there but I am not in a position to accept the amendment for the reasons I stated. However, I am happy to come back to it in the next general social welfare Bill.

The purpose of the amendment was to generate some debate on it given that we are recovering overpayments from social welfare recipients. The last time I proposed such an amendment, it was to last year's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. Employers need to pay some money back to the Department rather than the worker who is unfairly dismissed paying it back. There are additional consequences, which should be borne in mind when a judgment is being made. As the Minister outlined, it is probably a lot more complicated. I was aware of some of the consequences but I will have to look at the others again. It would be a useful exercise for the committee to look at this. In regard to the point Deputy Joan Collins raised, this is probably not the best place to deal with the issue of the Greyhound workers. I was there yesterday morning when the truck hit one of the workers. We need to look at employment legislation as advice given to the workers yesterday was that they should go immediately to the Department of Social Protection office to sign on because they had presented for work but were not allowed to work. That is a big burden on the Department of Social Protection which should not be imposed straightaway. Given the nature of labour laws and the way companies are seeking injunctions and are increasingly locking out workers, it needs to be addressed so that there is a quicker mechanism which prevents people being locked out of or refused entry to their workplace.  I hope the situation in Greyhound is resolved and I have heard the worker who was injured by the truck is out of hospital, but he was severely injured. There are question marks over the waste management system in the city of Dublin. I have asked colleagues to look at how it can be regulated rather than having trucks chasing each other in the middle of the night.  The whole issue of agency workers needs to be looked at. I saw with my own eyes what Deputy Joan Collins said happened. It was an absolute disgrace. If the authorities had been on the spot, they could have checked whether these people were qualified to drive the trucks and whether proper health and safety measures were in place. Recently, there was an incident where somebody slipped into the back of a waste management truck. That will happen if this situation continues to be allowed because these people do not know how to operate the trucks with which they are working. I will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the indication from the Minister that she will get her officials and officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to look at the implications and come back with legislation in the future.

I refer to a situation where workers find themselves locked out. In this case, it has been two days and I hope it can be resolved fairly soon. Greyhound went to court yesterday and got an injunction because it said it was a picket. It was not a picket but workers outside the facility were wondering what was going on. They were not disrupting anything. The union has given seven days notice of industrial action. These workers now find themselves in a very difficult situation. Can they go to the community welfare officer, in particular if they have young children or families in need of finance by the end of the week? They cannot get jobseeker's benefit because they do not have P45s. I am not sure what to advise them when they ask me that question.

I will ask the local office to give me a report on the situation because, as the Deputy knows, there can be some approaches there. However, I am not fully au fait with the situation and have just seen the headlines. The question of industrial relations in terms of the law is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	I move amendment No. 13:In page 12, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"(3) Section 232 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3):"(4) The Minister shall provide a copy of any regulation or variation to a regulation that she proposes to make under this section to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection and the Committee shall, having considered the proposal or proposals, report back to the Minister before any such regulation or variation to a regulation may commence.".".This deals with a section which, in the main, is a positive one. It refers to the meaning of "family" in the context of the family income supplement. It changes the definition of "family" for the purpose of the family income supplement to allow for a person whose child is not normally a member of the household to be entitled to FIS. The change the Minister has proposed would mean that a person must be wholly or substantially maintaining a spouse or civil partner also. The Minister will define in regulation what normally residing in the household means. I do not have a problem with the proposal per se but often the problem with regulations made in the House is that we see them after the Minister has made them. The proposal in the amendment is that a copy of the regulation or any future variation thereof would come before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection for consideration of the matter before reporting back to the Minister. That could be done in much the same way as we now have a pre-legislative stage of a Bill. It would allow for views other than those of the Minister and the Department to be gained on various issues. That would be a useful exercise for Ministers in general to consider. In many ways committees give their imprimatur as well as the Minister. In some cases certain aspects of the practical application of regulations could be missed by those who compiled them and they could be highlighted by Members of both Houses from a variety of backgrounds who are more aware of the situation in practice. That is the intent of the amendment. The Free Legal Advice Centres, in particular the Northside Community Law Centre, made a submission on 6 June very soon after the publication of the Bill and raised questions about the wording “wholly or mainly”. We do not have the amendments before us and some of our amendments were ruled out of order but perhaps some of what they intend to be captured might be addressed in the regulations because it relates to the definition of family. The intention is to have as broad a definition as possible to ensure nobody who should be entitled to FIS is prevented from getting it. If the amendment is accepted, we could have a discussion in the joint committee to see whether the definition of family is appropriate.

I tabled an amendment which we spoke about privately last week that was ruled out of order. We are all coming from the same perspective on the issue. The last thing we want to see is people are trapped in the social welfare system and that every possible incentive is put in place to get people off welfare and into the workplace. Members on all sides of the House are committed to that. Last week a newspaper article highlighted the fact that sometimes families with children are better off staying within the social welfare system than going out to work. I wish to highlight three examples in that regard specifically on families and family income supplement. The objective of family income supplement is to try to encourage people to take up low-paid jobs where they have families and that there would be a top-up payment – a very valuable supplement - from the Department of Social Protection. Probably the biggest gripe I have with the Department on the matter is that the FIS should be promoted to a far greater extent.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	I agree but we have no budget.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	The Minister will probably be surprised to hear how many public servants are unaware that they are eligible to get family income supplement. I find that amazing. One individual I came across works in the private sector. As I often do, I raised the issue of family income supplement and encouraged the person to apply. Every Member should try to do that at every available opportunity. He sent me an e-mail with a photo attached from his phone. The person is working full time in a low-paid job and he had to ring during business hours when the Department is open. When he rang the Department to inquire about family income supplement he was on the phone for three hours and 12 minutes before he got to speak to someone who could advise him about family income supplement. Sadly, that is not an isolated situation. I am aware of a number of people who have found it impossible to get someone at the end of the phone in the family income supplement section. I have no doubt the officials concerned are inundated but it does not make sense that someone who is in employment should have to spend three hours and 12 minutes on the phone to get through to departmental officials to find out if they are entitled to a supplement to assist them to remain in employment. That should not happen but the case I highlight is not isolated and the situation must be addressed. The second issue I wish to raise specifically on family income supplement is the one I raised privately with the Minister last week. The Minister has created an anomaly within the legislation before the House which discriminates against low-income families. The objective behind the proposed new section is that if someone applies for family income supplement and is let go or laid off within the 12 month period, once he or she becomes eligible again, he or she would be entitled to the remainder of the 12 months of the family income supplement. That is okay if they go back into the same employment at the same rate or higher but there is no incentive for them to take up a job at a lower rate of income because while they would be entitled to a higher rate of family income supplement were it a new application, under the rules proposed by the Minister the application will be treated as a reactivation of the existing application. Deputy O’Dea’s amendment, which was ruled out of order, is on the same basis in that it states that one should get the rate that is applicable at that point, especially if it is a higher rate. There is a precedent for such an approach. If someone applies for the old age pension and the current rate of payment is more beneficial to them than otherwise might be the case, the person is left on the higher rate. Surely a person should have an option to go on to the higher rate if they are in a lower paid job rather than excluding them from the employment market until they get a job that pays at the same rate or a higher rate as their previous employment. The third anomaly in terms of trying to get families back to work is the change the Minister has made to the community employment, CE, scheme. Someone on a CE scheme now pays PRSI. That was introduced in the previous social welfare Bill. The difficulty is that someone with an adult dependant and two children who has an opportunity to get on a CE scheme is better off to the tune of €5.13 a week because of the PRSI liability before one takes into account the cost of going to work or providing lunch. There is no incentive for someone in that situation to take up a CE scheme. A person with an adult dependant and two dependent children are being told by the Department not to take up a CE scheme.It makes far more sense to get someone into a CE scheme. The scheme in my adjoining parish in Moore, County Roscommon, has an exemplary record in getting people from CE schemes back into employment. Many of them have been very successful in breaking the cycle. The type of family in question will be better off, in theory, to the sum of €5.13. That is before they pay for the fuel to get to work and pay for their lunch, however, meaning they would be financially worse off by taking up a CE scheme. That should not happen. Instead, we need to break the cycle for them and subsequent generations, and encourage people to get back into employment through CE schemes. These anomalies are barriers to that happening.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I do not propose to accept the amendment. Family income supplement, FIS, is a weekly tax-free support targeted at low-income workers who have children. FIS provides a crucial support for over 44,000 families at work and almost 100,000 children. Spending on the supplement was increased significantly this year by the Government with the total allocation coming to €280 million. Numbers in receipt of the supplement have also increased significantly though making qualification for it easier. The purpose of this support is to provide an incentive to such workers to take up or stay in employment, rather than claiming a social welfare payment. While weekly social welfare payments are increased according to the family size, weekly income from employment does not take any account of the worker’s family size. Weekly social welfare payments under FIS are increased according to family size, namely, €100 per week for the first child and pro rata for subsequent children. In the case referred to by Deputy Naughten of the recipient with a spouse and two children, on social welfare they would receive €400 a week plus some additional benefits. Even on a minimum wage job, FIS would bring their income significantly over that figure. In keeping with the purpose of the FIS scheme, in the situation where a claimant for FIS is living apart from his or her spouse or civil partner and children, it has been the practice to pay FIS in these cases where the claimant is maintaining both his or her spouse or civil partner and his or her children. The relevant legislative provisions relating to entitlement in cases where the worker is living apart from his or her spouse or civil partner and children is not fully clear and section 9 clarifies entitlement to FIS in these circumstances. Section 9 redefines what constitutes a family for FIS purposes and affirms that FIS cannot be paid to a claimant who is maintaining a child where that child is not residing with the claimant, unless the claimant is also maintaining his or her separated spouse or civil partner with whom the child is residing. It further clarifies that in such cases FIS cannot be paid if the spouse or civil partner with whom the child is residing is in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment in his or her own right. There have been 30 such cases where clarification has been required. Under the provisions contained in section 9, the circumstances in which a child is to be regarded as normally being a member of a household for FIS entitlement purposes will be specified in regulations to be made in accordance with section 232 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. This is not an issue where the parents or guardians and children are living together. However, where the parents or guardians are living apart, regulations are required to set out the rules to be used to determine with which parent or guardian the children will be regarded as normally residing for FIS entitlement purposes.  This amendment proposes that any regulations required to be made in accordance with section 232 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act would have to be submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in the first instance. Accordingly, such regulations could not be made before that committee reports back to the Minister. As I indicated on Committee Stage, the provisions contained in section 9 will be brought into force by way of a commencement order. The relevant regulations required in accordance with section 232 will be made as soon as the necessary commencement order has been signed. There are several other commencement orders and regulations which are also required to be made following the enactment of this Bill. I envisage the relevant commencement order and regulations relating to section 9 will be signed in September or October. I have undertaken to send copies of this commencement order and the relevant regulations to Deputies as soon as they have been signed. Section 4(6) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act requires that all regulations made by the Minister under that Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practical after they have been made. If a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days, those regulations will be annulled. Accordingly, I do not consider this amendment is necessary. In the case to which Deputy Naughten referred, I presume the individual in question was on to the Longford social protection office. If he gives me the details of that, I will make an inquiry about it. When I came into the Department, an enormous backlog had built up in social protection offices. All Members were aware of this and showed huge patience while we updated all IT platforms. Some of the schemes went to Letterkenny where staff have handled them very well there. With the improvement in the waiting times dealing with applications and reviews, we got rid of many of the backlogs with FIS. If the Deputy gives me the details of the case to which he referred, I will see if there is a problem with the phone lines. It must be remembered just under 100,000 people are benefiting from FIS and it is helping families back into work. The staff in the Longford office, in fairness to them, have worked very hard to improve the service.

The Department does not have much of any budget for advertising, unlike many other Departments. I would be more than happy if the Deputy proposed we get some additional funding for our advertising budget.

We have also upgraded the Department’s website. If Deputy Naughten gives me the details of the case in question, I will make an inquiry about it.

This needed to be addressed because €70 a week is a big amount of money and equates to a food bill. It amounts to a €3,500 a year food bill which the 6,000 single parents affected by this, mostly women, will not receive. According to the Minister's explanation, a Scandinavian system was to be put in place before this amount of money was withdrawn. Has the Department made any assessment as to how many of the 6,000 parents will be eligible to apply for the family income supplement, FIS? This would at least be a counterbalance to some degree. The €70 a week, or €3,500 a year, for the 6,000 people amounts to €21 million. It is literally taking the food off the table of one-parent families unless there is a counterbalance. What is the counterbalance?

I have introduced a jobseekers transition payment, whereby lone parents of children aged between seven and 14 years will be encouraged to go back to education and training. I have made money available to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs from the Department's budget for this purpose. Lone parents taking up work are eligible for FIS, and our experience of the changes in the FIS rules is that many lone parents are significantly better off. It is not a matter in the legislation, but if the Deputy wishes to give me an example I can state we have worked very hard with organisations representing lone parents and other organisations which take an interest in lone parents. The way the changes in FIS for which I have been responsible have been introduced means there has been a very enhanced take-up of FIS by lone parents and, together with income from employment, this has resulted in significant enhancement of lone parents' income. If the Deputy has a particular concern about a particular case he might let me know and I will have a look at the circumstances.

Women did not have an opportunity to earn an independent income. The mother and baby homes died out when a former Labour Party predecessor of mine, Frank Cluskey, who was a former Member of the House and Minister, introduced specifically the right for women who were parenting on their own to have an income. As a consequence we had a sea change from the situation where women parenting on their own had to fall back on charity. Women in particular should have capacity and be enabled by the social welfare system, because perhaps having a child early whom they have been looking after on their own meant they may have missed out on education and training. It should in particular make provision and encourage women to be able to take up education and training, as opposed to the legacy issues about which we read and which will be the subject of an inquiry.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	On the amendment, we introduced FIS, which is a good system, but it is riddled with anomalies. I have pointed out a number of them on several occasions. As I pointed out on Second Stage some of these anomalies constitute a poverty trap. The amendment I tabled was ruled out of order but I will refer generally to the section. FIS is calculated as 60% of the difference between a certain threshold and the income a person earns if it is under this threshold. The threshold depends on a person's circumstances, such as how many children he or she has. The Minister is stating that if people start the year in a low income job they will qualify for a certain amount of FIS, but if they drop off the FIS system during the year for one reason or another, such as losing a job and receiving jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit or no longer working 38 hours a fortnight, and before the end of 12 months they qualify for FIS again they will be paid for the last couple of months but at the same rate as they received at the beginning of the year. This makes no sense. If people comes back into the FIS system because of returning to employment they might have a job which pays more than the job they had at the beginning of the year, in which case they may be entitled to less FIS or perhaps no FIS, but they will be paid. They might have a job which pays less than the job they had at the beginning of the year, which means they would be entitled to more FIS but they will only receive the same amount as they did at the beginning of the year, even though they now need more because they are earning less. This does not make any sense. I proposed that when people return to the FIS system FIS should be calculated on their circumstances at that time. This is eminently reasonable, but it was ruled out of order because it might constitute a charge on the Exchequer. It is equally or even more likely it would result in saving the Exchequer money.

I am trying to avoid this situation in the first place by trying to ensure, not only with regard to social welfare legislation, that where regulations are made they go before committees of the House for discussion. We should get into this practice and it is in line with the new method of working in the House with the pre-legislative stage. I understand from what the Minister stated that she is not inclined to do so on this occasion, but I ask her in future discussions around the Cabinet table on Dáil reform that this mechanism is examined.As 11 Members of the Houses and sometimes more sit on the committee, this means 11 different sets of eyes are available in this regard. Moreover, every Member of the House is entitled to attend the committee. Members can then try to spot where regulations may not be fully conversant with life outside. As Deputy O'Dea observed in respect of the anomalies that arise, in the case of anomalies on how the family income supplement, FIS, works, for example, one sometimes only finds out a year later when one or two cases arise, after which one may come across six or seven cases. Sometimes, the Deputies on this side of the House or even on the Government backbenches can spot these anomalies in advance but it is too late because by the time they see the regulations, they have been laid before the House. I have been in the Oireachtas for 12 years and in that time have never seen a regulation that has been laid before the Houses brought before the House and overturned. Such regulations sit there until such time as new regulations are made. Consequently, it is a pity the Minister is not inclined to accept this proposal. It is like some of my other proposals made in the past, in that I will continue to make them until somebody listens at some stage and hopefully Members will get a system in which Parliament is regulating better, rather than simply the Department and the Minister.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	As for amendment No. 18, in some ways this is similar to the argument I made in respect of amendment No. 13. This is slightly more peculiar because it deals with the proposals regarding habitual residence conditions. A positive change is being proposed in this Bill and I have already stated that quite a number of its measures are positive. However, it requires the departmental officials to make on an ongoing basis a determination as to whether somebody remains habitually resident. I understand the two-year rule is disappearing, as it should do, as required by European law. In this amendment, I am trying to encourage the Minister to allow the draft regulations come before a committee or the Dáil or whichever, before signing off on them. This would enable Members to try to ensure the regulations would stand up to proper testing. In this case, the Minister will produce the regulations and while I do not propose in this amendment that they should go before the Oireachtas committee, in line with my other amendment this is what the intention would be. At the very least, however, regulations should set out how the Department intends to control this change and how it intends to verify that a series of different decisions are not being made in different parts of the country with regard to habitual residence. This issue has caused problems for a number of people who have approached me. In such cases, an official has made the wrong determination, even though from my experience, it was quite clear the person in question would have qualified for social protection benefits in the past. This meant the people concerned were obliged to appeal or, if they approached me sufficiently early, to get a review. In fairness, the relevant officials, be they from the Department or the Social Welfare Appeals Office, have in most cases in which it was quite clear that somebody qualified overturned the original decision. It is a complicated area and that is why, if it is set out quite clearly in regulations, there would not be any mistakes from either the officials or from those Members who are looking in. I acknowledge that sometimes, Members also get it wrong and, having looked at a case, can give advice to somebody that he or she is deserving of a social welfare payment but sometimes they do not see the full picture. However, were the regulations set out as clearly as I would hope, it would be easier in respect of what is a very complicated aspect of qualification for social welfare payments.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	I do not propose to accept amendment No. 18. The Deputy noted and welcomed the provisions in respect of the two-year rule. Consequently, the issue here is that unless this kind of change is introduced, it could result in the State continuing to pay social assistance to claimants who may no longer have that entitlement, having, for example, lost their status as migrant workers. Essentially, it provides for that situation, if appropriate, to be reviewed. The five factors, which are derived from European Union legislation such as Article 11 of Regulation No. 987/2009, the European Court of Justice jurisprudence including the Swaddling case and the Knoch case among others, are listed in section 246(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidated Act 2005. Guidelines on habitual residence have been published by my Department. They are freely available to everybody and are updated regularly to take account of developments nationally, at EU level and at the European Court of Justice. Full training is given on the use of the guidelines to all deciding officers and designated persons with refresher training offered when the guidelines are updated. If a person is dissatisfied with a decision given regarding habitual residence, two avenues of appeal are open to that person. He or she may seek a review of that decision or he or she may appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. As the elements for the decision-making process already are laid down in primary legislation and there are adequate means of redress through the review and appeal procedures, I remain of the view that it is unnecessary to provide secondary legislation as proposed by the Deputy in amendment No. 18.

On Committee Stage, I argued that while I was not opposed to the measure, I found it strange that it was included in this legislation because I believe it is a duplication of what already is available through the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the promises by various Ministers for Justice and Equality that CAB would be recalibrated to look beyond the high-profile cases. As Members are aware, CAB has the Minister's multi-agency approach in respect of dealing with social welfare.It comprises the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda Síochána and, if required, officials of Departments, which in many cases is an inspector of the Department of Social Protection. I am unsure whether the gardaí involved are required in such numbers. I have argued previously for more social welfare inspectors to help out because an increase in the number of inspectors results in more money being recovered. I am not arguing against this proposal per se. My concern is the provision in the Bill about the wearing of uniforms. Current powers for secondment stipulate that gardaí must be in uniform and this provision could allow gardaí to work under cover for the Department. That sounds fine, and they can do so in any case, but my amendment provides that they should stay in uniform. I refer to the practice in multi-agency checkpoints which often are made up of representatives of the Revenue Commissioners who are not in uniform and representatives from the Department of Social Protection who do not wear a uniform nor do I intend them to wear a uniform. As a consequence, a multi-agency task force checkpoint might not have any identifiable uniforms on show. I am concerned at that approach. Maybe if the gardaí are confined to office they do not need to be in uniform, but the social welfare inspectors who have visited homes do not wear a uniform and I do not see the reason a garda in uniform would make any major difference. That said, I will not delay the passage of the Bill on this issue. It was not the subject of discussion on Committee Stage. The other provisions in section 15 are fine and this one seems to be an anomaly.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	This is a pilot scheme. It is envisaged that the secondment will be for a period of 12 months. The proposal has been progressed by the Department, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána. The primary function of any garda assigned to the Department's special investigation unit will be to investigate allegations or to initiate investigations into social welfare fraud. The role will be consistent with the functions already performed by officers in the special investigation unit, SIU. These officers will be responsible for fraud investigation and to ensure control activity is undertaken within the three main pillars of the Department's compliance and anti-fraud strategy, namely, prevention, detection and deterrence. Officers will be required to collate and assemble suitable evidence to enable a deciding officer to review an entitlement to a social welfare payment and in certain circumstances to use in legal proceedings where offences have been committed under the Social Welfare Act. The gardaí will be working closely in collaboration with other compliance and fraud investigation agencies to ensure social welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected. They will participate in operations such as the joint investigation unit operations with Revenue, the taxi regulator and the National Employment Rights Agency, as well as multi-agency vehicle checks. This inter-agency activity is a key element to assist in fraud investigation, and the shadow or hidden economy will be a key priority for joint investigations. In serious cases of identity fraud or multiple claiming of allowances, gardaí assigned to the Department will be actively engaged in the detection and prosecution of such cases. There is also scope for them to be engaged in the investigation of cases at ports and airports to deal with what is termed welfare tourism. This will give an enhanced capacity to detect this practice. Invitations have been issued for applications and more than 200 have been received. The locations for the scheme will be the Dublin metropolitan area, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Cork, Limerick, Navan and Sligo. Successful applicants will be seconded to the Department's special investigation unit. An interview board has been constituted comprising a Garda superintendent and inspector as well as the principal officer who holds the national management responsibility for the special investigation unit. Any garda seconded to the Department will be issued with a certificate of secondment which will clearly identify that he or she is appointed to work with the Department. This certificate will include a photograph of the person concerned. I wish to reassure the Deputy and the public that, as a matter of practice, departmental investigators identify and produce their certificate of appointment to all persons they deal with. The change in the Bill to remove the phrase “in uniform” is being made, first, to achieve consistency between section 250(16) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which currently requires a social welfare inspector to be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform and section 250(16B) which, while also requiring a social welfare inspector to be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána, does not have an in uniform condition. The second reason for the removal of the phrase is to allow for gardaí seconded to the Department to accompany social welfare inspectors carrying out activities under section 16 without the requirement to be in uniform. This is a practical issue. The seconded members remain members of the Garda Síochána and they are appointed to the Department of Social Protection with appropriate photographic identification. I repeat that this is a pilot scheme and there will be an opportunity to review its operation in due course.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	I move amendment No. 22:In page 21, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"(2) The powers conferred on the Minister by sections 14, 16 and 17 shall not be utilised until after the Department of Social Protection make all reasonable efforts to recover these payments through installed repayments.".This amendment does not relate to people who are defrauding the system but to people who, on the basis of a mistake on their own part or the part of the Department, find themselves owing money to the Department, in other words, cases of overpayment. Normally in such circumstances the Department demands repayment and this is done by way of instalments deducted from a person's social welfare payments. The Minister proposes to change the position to give the Department the power to take back an overpayment in one lump sum. I reiterate that the persons concerned are victims of a genuine mistake, rather than fraudsters. As I and other Deputies pointed out on Second Stage, some of those affected may need the lump sum and we could cite several examples where this is the case.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure discretion is exercised in this matter. Rather than the Department dipping its hand into a person's lump sum and taking back the precise amount owed, it should first seek to make an instalment arrangement, provided it is appropriate in the circumstances to do so. I accept the Minister's point that in some cases people have other resources from which the overpayment can be returned. My amendment does not fully capture the objective I am seeking to achieve. I attempted to change the text but did not have an opportunity to do so because of the short period between Committee Stage and Report Stage. As the Minister will be aware, Deputies were given a briefing by departmental officials in advance of the Bill being introduced in the House. When I raised this issue I was informed that discretion would be exercised and each case would be considered on its merits. I accept that will be the case and the Department will not demand that the full amount be repaid immediately in every single case. However, the decision in all cases will be at the discretion of the relevant social welfare official. While I have come across social welfare officials who are extremely reasonable, decent and very easy to deal with, unfortunately others I have encountered could not be described in such terms. The position of the person in respect of whom an overpayment has been made depends on the official with whom he or she is dealing. Being at the mercy of an official means a person can be lucky or unlucky. If it is intended that such cases should be examined on an individual basis, guidelines should be laid down in the Bill to narrow the discretion available to officials.  In many cases, the decision by the Department as to whether to take an overpayment by way of a lump sum from moneys to which a person is entitled to receive from the Department or another Department can make a great difference. A guiding principle should apply to such cases. If it is intended that restraint should be exercised, depending on circumstances, this intention should be reflected in the legislation.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	I agree with Deputy O'Dea on this matter. Care must be shown when making attachment orders. It is well and good that overpayments made to those in receipt of State moneys should be captured from payments made to such persons. While this is probably right and proper in the vast majority of cases, specifically when an award is being made to a person, people should be able to request that discretion be shown when such anomalies or cases arise. I cited the example of a senior citizen who applies for a sustainable energy grant to insulate his or her home before the arrival of winter. Such work must be paid for in advance, which means the applicant must obtain a small loan to pay the contractors perhaps €2,000 or €3,000 for the works. If it subsequently transpires that the person received an overpayment of €1,000 or €2,000, this sum will be taken in a lump sum from the grant of €3,000 available under the sustainable energy scheme before it is paid to the applicant. This is done on the basis that the grant is made by the State. Such a scenario would leave the individual in question with a bank or credit union debt and interest to pay. The blanket capture of overpayments will not always work because hard cases will always arise. In such cases, the Department should consider payment by instalment. In fairness to local authorities and the Department, they have been willing to recoup overpayments by way of instalment where a person's sole income is derived from social welfare payments. The legislation was changed in the past year or two to increase the amounts the Department could recoup in instalments from a person's social welfare payment. I believe the maximum weekly instalment, which previously stood at €2, was increased to 15%, which means a weekly amount of €27 can be recouped from the maximum rate of jobseeker's allowance.  I note the contrast between these provisions and the provisions that apply to taxpayers seeking to have tax overpayments reimbursed. Such claims may only be made for overpayments made in the previous four years. In the case of the Department, however, I have with me a letter in which it is seeking to recoup, at a rate of €30 per week, an overpayment made in September 1984. In another case, it contacted a person requesting that an overpayment of €19.20 made in 2005 be repaid at a rate of €2 per week. Given the bureaucracy involved in issuing this letter, I assume it was not cost-effective to seek such a small amount. All money owed to the State should be recovered, unless we agree to my previous proposal to introduce a social welfare amnesty and draw a line in the sand. It is handy for the Revenue Commissioners to draw a line in the sand under all tax owed for more than four years as this allows them to get away with not repaying people who either do not understand the taxation system or should pay more attention to their tax affairs. In some cases, the overpayment is caused by the complexity of the tax system or a taxpayer's ignorance of the reliefs available. After four years, taxpayers seeking to recoup overpayments in tax are told, "hard luck". The State, on the other hand, is always able to pursue overpayments.  I repeat the warning I gave on Committee Stage that this provision has the potential to create problems in certain cases involving grants, reliefs and so forth. I refer specifically to people on low wages who are not in receipt of social welfare payments. Repayments can be made by instalment in cases where the person who has been overpaid receives a social welfare payment.However, because this is a lump sum coming back to somebody, whether he or she is in work or on social welfare, the overpayment could be deducted in full. That means somebody who has an expectation of money coming back to him or her could end up with a lot less or end up in the situation, as I stated, in the case of an energy sustainable grant or even a disability grant, where he or she has to fork out some of the money to get an extension done, for example, to facilitate wheelchair access. I want to warn the Minister and highlight that before she signs off on the Bill.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	The issue of the recovery of overpayments, particularly in relation to fraud, is significant for the Department. If my memory serves me correctly, it amounted to €73 million last year, almost the cost of the free travel scheme. The sums involved are significant. I do not propose to accept this amendment. In response to Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General require the Department to recover overpayments. The Department, unlike the Revenue Commissioners, does not charge penalties or interest. I note this can be a sensitive issue. The Department has existing powers of attachment in relation to earnings and amounts held in financial institutions by debtors. It takes a measured approach in the use of its existing powers. From correspondence I have seen from Deputies, I am aware that they often intervene if they feel there are extenuating circumstances of which the Department ought to be made aware. I, as Minister, and officials have been happy to take that into account where we have received that information. The existing powers are operated within strict guidelines that contain explicit safeguards. They are only exercised where a person with a debt continuously ignores his or her obligations to repay what is legally due to the State, and where it is established that there is a reasonable capacity to pay. Fundamentally, the provision is underpinned by the capacity-to-pay principle. Where a notice of attachment is considered, a final demand issues to the person concerned advising him or her of the consequences of not repaying. Before the Department moves to issuing a final demand, it has already undertaken a protracted process to endeavour to get the overpaid person to engage with the Department about his or her debt and to discharge what is legally due. The overpaid person is given an opportunity to make representations so that any factors associated with the recovery of the overpayment can be duly considered. The overpaid person has an opportunity to advise an officer of the Minister of all outgoings and the person's financial circumstances. This will critically inform whether a notice of attachment is issued and what amounts should be contained in the notice of attachment. The new provision in this Bill will allow the Department to consider recovery of social welfare debts from amounts due to be paid to its debtors from other State funds. The safeguards that are built in to the existing powers of attachment will also continue to apply in these cases. The overall objective of my Department's debt recovery policy is to maximise the recovery of overpayments to protect public money at a time of scarce resources. All overpayments due to the Department must be repaid. Unlike other agencies, in particular, the Revenue Commissioners, we do not charge penalties or interest. The recovery of funds is an important cash flow for the Department. I would not like the Department to be berated by the Committee of Public Accounts because it did not recover a sufficient amount of the money due to the Department. The system is operated carefully and all avenues are exhausted to get the person to agree to the return of an overpayment. As the Deputy stated, the amounts involved, in terms of somebody who is on a social welfare payment, are strictly limited to 15% of the primary social welfare payment and other social welfare payments in respect of dependants or children are not included. It is only in respect of the primary social welfare payment for the person concerned.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	There is no suggestion from this side of the House that the Department should not pursue situations where it has paid money out incorrectly. Of course, it has a responsibility to recover overpayments. We are simply making the point that sometimes such overpayments are not the fault of the payee. Sometimes such payments arise because those recipients made a genuine error in their application and often they happen because the Department has made an error. The Minister makes the point that, in relation to attachment orders, every effort has been made to recover the money before the attachment order is issued. That is not absolutely correct. Attachment orders have issued in certain cases where there was little enough communication between the debtor and the creditor in advance. In any case, the attachment order procedure here does not apply in relation to social welfare and the point holds, certainly, for social welfare overpayments. The Minister has stated that the Department intends to be measured in this matter. I accept it is her intention that the Department be measured, be restrained and exercise reasonable discretion in these type of cases. All I suggest - I am not in favour of making legislation too long and complex - is if such is her intention, she should state that in the Bill. It will not add much to the Bill, at most a couple of lines. If that is her intention, she should say it so that all deciding officers will know that they have an obligation to be measured, restrained and reasonable in the operation of this new power.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I move amendment No. 23:In page 23, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"(2) The definition of a qualified member as a trustee of a pension fund and the definition of a person eligible to vote for the trustee of a pension fund means an active member or deferred member or a pensioner member of the relevant scheme on that date or on such previous date.".This arises out of an anomaly in the legislation whereby deferred members have no rights or say in who are the trustees of a pension fund. I can see a problem associated with it whereby a short-term deferred member may be a long-time member of the pension fund but towards the end of his or her career either loses his or her position or changes jobs and as a result has no say whatsoever in who would represent him or her on the trustees of the pension fund. It seems totally unfair. We are in a democratic state and I would have thought that all those who are members of a club, an organisation or, in this case, a pension fund would have the right to a say as to who should represent him or her. Not alone do they not have a right to a say as to who should represent them, they themselves cannot be voted into the position of trustee of the pension fund. If a person has made contributions over a long number of years and circumstances have changed, where the person has moved on to another employment or the company provided a redundancy package and this individual has moved on as a result, the person cannot have any say in the role of a trustee. I agree the trustee is supposed to represent everybody, but it is unfair that someone who is part and parcel of the pension fund does not have a right to vote. We should look at this. As to whether we should do so in the Bill, I saw it as an opportunity when we were talking about the role of trustees in pension funds.I thought it might be an opportunity to define who a trustee was and who could vote for the trustees. I ask the Minister of State to examine this matter and give it serious consideration. I am also aware that we may have to take on board potential EU legislation that may impinge on this area. We should look at this issue, however, to see whether we can do something in this Bill or in future legislation to give deferred members the same rights as pensioners and active members who are paying into the pension fund.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	I do not propose to accept this amendment. Procedures for the appointment of trustees are usually set out in the trust deed and rules of a pension scheme. Section 62 of the Pensions Act allows for regulations to be made to provide for member participation in the selection of persons to be appointed as trustees. I understand that, in practice, the provisions of the member trustee regulations are rarely used and the composition of the trustee board is very often agreed at scheme level on a consensual basis. It should be noted that under existing trust law, all trustees, no matter how appointed, have an obligation to act in the best interests of all members. Trustees cannot act as a representative or advocate for a particular subset from which they are drawn but must serve all classes of beneficiary impartially. In its guidance to trustees, the Pensions Authority reaffirms these principles which are also complemented by the provisions in the Pensions Act. The current focus in relation to trusteeship is on raising the performance of trustees and proposing minimum standards for trustee education, knowledge, understanding and behaviour that would be considerably more demanding than the current trustee training requirements. This is with a view to supporting best outcomes for all scheme members. This issue of trusteeship will be considered in the context of evolving pension policy and in particular in the context of the report by the Pensions Authority arising from the defined contribution consultation process, which the Pensions Authority launched in August 2013. I expect the report on this consultation to be with the Minister in early autumn. Proposals are emanating from the European Commission in relation to amendments to Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision. These proposals include enhanced governance structures for pension schemes which have significant impacts on the roles of the scheme trustees. The current proposals require trustees of a pension scheme to hold relevant professional qualifications. Negotiations on these proposals are ongoing and are likely to continue until the end of next year. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection was briefed on the proposals to amend the directive. The committee will be kept up to date on progress. I can assure the House that the Department and the Pensions Authority are committed to ensuring all trustees, irrespective of their origin, administer their schemes in the best interests of all their members and in accordance with the provisions of the Pensions Act. I must stress again that the trustees of a pension scheme are required under trust law to act at all times in the best interests of scheme members, irrespective of whether trustees are appointed under the terms of the trust deed and rules of the pension scheme or whether they are appointed under regulations made under section 62 of the Pensions Act.

What I am trying to get across, however, is that some members of that pension fund - the deferred pension members - do not have a right to vote. Nor do they have the right to go forward as trustees. My amendment seeks to give them an equal right similar to the active members and pensioner members. I understand what the Minister of State said about the review. I can also see that perhaps in future we will introduce legislation to cover deferred members, but currently they do not have the same rights, irrespective of how long they may have been paying into a pension fund. Some may have been paying into such a fund for five or six years, while others may have done so for 20 years. They might have deferred their pension for one reason or another, but they do not have any rights to vote for trustees or to act as trustees. In a democracy, we need to give these people who have paid into a pension fund the right to choose those trustees who represent them. I welcome the fact there is an ongoing review of this matter. I hope it will be dealt with in future legislation. I know my amendment is a bit rough but I can tailor it to ensure deferred members have rights. We should define how long they have to be in a pension fund before getting voting rights. Having listened to the Minister of State's comments on EU directives and the report of the Pensions Authority, I hope we will get legislation to allow deferred members to have the same rights as active and pensioner members.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I move amendment No. 24:In page 23, to delete lines 29 to 32.The Minister of State is lucky because I am trying to get back to a committee. I will be brief as we have discussed this matter previously. This section of the legislation relates to the pension elements and circumstances whereby we are dealing with the unilateral restructuring of pension schemes as directed by the Pensions Authority. In that sense, Deputy Lawlor's amendment is somewhat obscure because it does not really matter who the trustees are. Ultimately, the Pensions Authority can dictate anything over the trustees' heads. Even if deferred members had the right to elect their own trustees, those trustees can be superseded by decisions of the Pensions Authority. My fear is that this section gives the authority even greater powers in that regard. We are dealing with scenarios where pensioners' benefits will be cut. It is not a positive scenario where they will be getting extra benefits, so it is very difficult. We have to see it against the backdrop of difficulties that have emerged in defined benefit pension schemes. So far, the State's response to them has been wholly inadequate and out of kilter with developments in Britain where the authorities have adopted a more responsible attitude.Consider some of the big defined benefit schemes which are currently in the news, such as the Irish aviation superannuation, IAS, scheme. That scheme has 15,000 members, some of whom are facing massive reductions in their benefits. When they signed up to their contracts, their terms of employment required them to be members of the scheme. They are now faced with the double insult that their colleagues who worked with them in Britain are going to get their full pension entitlements thanks to the legislation put in place in that country. It is important to set the scene in that regard. The measures that the Minister is introducing should be viewed in the context of other legislation which is currently before the courts. A High Court ruling in 2012 found that the pension deficit in the IAS scheme was a contingent liability for the companies concerned, which led the workers and members of the scheme to believe that the trustees would be able to take legal action to force the companies to honour their pension liabilities as defined by the High Court. I fear this section, which gives the Pensions Authority an overriding power over the trustees, will tie their hands in that regard and is potentially in conflict with legislation that is before the courts. In Britain, a number of relatively recent landmark cases involving defined benefits, including a case involving IBM, resulted in rulings that workers have a reasonable expectation to a certain commitment on their retirement based on the contracts they signed. The guidance notes prepared on foot of the passage of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2013, which we discussed prior to Christmas, were tilted in favour of the employers and did not take adequate account of the rights of members. The fact that no employer covenant accompanies this section of the legislation weakens it considerably in that regard. I do not think it is necessary because it gives too much power to the Pensions Authority to do what it likes over the heads of the trustees. For that reason, I am proposing the deletion of the relevant clause.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I am aware of the difficulties that many pension schemes currently face. In regard to the IAS scheme in particular, while I am aware that extensive efforts are being made by all parties, including the expert panel, to resolve the extremely complicated issues arising, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual scheme. It is important to note that the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 ensures that pensioners maintain a significantly higher priority in pension scheme funds. However, it also fair and equitable in cases where the scheme is under funded and all members have made substantial contributions that some measure of protection is afforded to all members of the scheme. The concept of intergenerational risk sharing is not consistent with the previous situation, whereby people of working age could potentially lose their entire benefits in the event of a scheme being wound up before pensioners lose any benefits whatsoever. Existing provisions in section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990 gives the Pensions Authority the power to issue a directive to a pension scheme to restructure certain benefits. The measures set out in this Bill will ensure that trustees shall notify members of the details of such a direction and their right to appeal. Section 24 of the Bill provides that trustees are required to notify the members of the direction and the measures the Pensions Authority may specify to be taken in such a restructuring, or if no measures are specified, such measures that the trustees consider may be necessary to reduce the benefits in the scheme. If the Minister was to accept amendment No. 24, it would mean that the members of the scheme would not be notified of the details of the measures considered necessary to bring the scheme to a sustainable funding position. This section of the Bill also provides that trustees notify members of the right of appeal to the High Court against a direction by the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits. The majority of directions issued by the Pensions Authority to date were on the basis of an application from the trustees of the scheme to restructure scheme benefits. Such applications to the Pensions Authority can only be made after the trustees have completed a comprehensive review of the scheme and after consultation with employers and scheme members. The Pensions Authority can also issue a unilateral section 50 notice in circumstances where the trustees of a scheme are not complying with scheme funding requirements as set out in the 1990 Act. As the Deputy will be aware, the function of the Labour Court is to investigate industrial disputes. Having regard to the circumstances and the process underpinning the issue of a section 50 notice by the Pensions Authority, it is considered that the High Court is the appropriate court to hear such an appeal. In regard to amendment No. 26, section 3 of the 1990 Act already makes it an offence for a trustee to fail to notify members where the Pensions Authority makes a direction for a scheme to restructure scheme benefits. Therefore, these amendments are not required.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	This legislation is being put forward as a positive measure to allow members of a scheme to be open to a certain procedure in the event of a wind-up of the scheme, in terms of access to information. The High Court is proposed as an accessible mechanism for members of the scheme. The point of the amendment I have tabled is that experience has not shown that the High Court can play such a role. In the case of determinations by the Pensions Ombudsman, it is already possible to appeal to the High Court but such appeals are rarely pursued because they involve a cohort of elderly citizens. The people concerned are 72 years old on average. It does not appear suitable to me to ask them to pursue a costly High Court procedure. It would be preferable for members of the scheme to be given access to the State's workplace industrial relations machinery. We have discussed this previously in the context of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2013 and it was suggested that the issue might be dealt with in the guidance notes. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was asked subsequently about the matter and has indicated that he is examining the possibility of opening up the Labour Court mechanism. It is not possible at present for people to access the Labour Court if they are not currently employed but there must be some way around that. We raised this issue initially more than six months ago and more could be done to address it.The equality issues for pensions were discussed by the Equality Tribunal and there are surely routes other than the High Court that could be accessed by workers in dealing with such issues. Trustees are already in law obligated to consult members but the groups of existing retired staff and deferred members do not have a recognised collective voice. That must be addressed. The Minister indicated she is not prepared to discuss individual schemes, but with the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, the retired pensioner group has seen a proposition of €7 million to be taken from them in restructuring. The expert panel met these people and indicated it could not deal with the group because it has no status, despite their living standards being on the line. These people were sent on their merry way and the expert panel made no recommendations and did not address the scenario. There must be a much better mechanism than what exists now and even what is being proposed in the amendment. Access to the Labour Court would be a better alternative, along with some mechanism for recognising groups.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	352	I will be moving amendment No. 26. If I understand the section correctly, it does not give the pension authority the right to override trustees, as that right has existed since 1990 and arises in pensions legislation. When trustees get a unilateral direction from the Pensions Authority to restructure the fund, it puts an obligation on the trustees to inform the pensioners, which is some sort of progress. I agree with Deputy Daly about the issue of appealing to the High Court. I could not believe my eyes when I read that people could appeal to the High Court. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult, as it involves contacting solicitors, senior counsel and all sorts of such characters. Surely to goodness there can be an appeal and if the Labour Court is not appropriate, it could go to some other mechanism that could be reached quickly and relatively inexpensively. The thought of appealing some aspect of a direction to trustees or how they deal with it to the High Court is farcical. My amendment deals with the fact that an extra obligation is being put on trustees but there is no sanction in certain legislation if trustees do not comply with it. The Minister's able replacement mentioned that it was already covered so will the Minister clarify that? What is the sanction if trustees fail to inform members of a direction from the Pensions Authority?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I am sorry but I had to leave for a couple of minutes. I have some detailed notes on the comments. Since becoming Minister for Social Protection, my officials and I have devoted an enormous amount of time to getting defined benefit pensions schemes in particular across the line so as to save schemes from closing. That has happened to significant numbers of schemes, particularly since the onset of the economic crash. I do not want to comment on individual schemes but the most important act is to seek to save schemes and, if we can, get them across the line. I am happy that since we changed the legislation, the number of schemes moving to a significantly better position and which can continue has increased. For the members of schemes, current workers and deferred and retired members, I appreciate these are very difficult issues. In many cases changes are agreed to make a scheme viable and I hope that in future, with returns on the markets improving, members may agree to changes allowing the overall liabilities of schemes to be diminished. If financial conditions improve, it may be possible to continue schemes, with the different positions of members being recovered. Many people here have spoken at times about Ireland potentially defaulting, and I have always been of the opinion that it would have been unwise for a variety of reasons. People may have seen stories recently about the court cases in the United States relating to Argentina, which defaulted way back in 2001. We are now in 2014 but that country is still unable to resolve the issues arising from the default 13 years ago. It has been reported on the financial pages of most national and international newspapers that Argentina is potentially at risk of a further default many long years after its first. Many defined benefit schemes have been seriously affected, as the pensions regulator pointed out on numerous occasions, by the catastrophes that occurred on the financial markets. If we can get schemes to address some deficit issues - I will not speak about a particular scheme - and members can reach agreement, this could come with a continued recovery in stock markets and particularly with regard to government debt and international bonds. People are aware, for example, that Irish debt is on sale now at only a small margin above the German debt rates. People may also have seen in recent months that Ireland's ranking has improved enormously, and such events set the ground conditions for significant potential recovery, provided scheme members can reach agreement. I certainly hope that can happen. Members are concerned about issues being brought before the Labour Court and into the industrial relations forums. The industrial relations issues are not a matter for this Department, although I understand what Deputies have said regarding the Minister responsible for industrial relations, who is examining the matter. The matter of going to the High Court is again a matter for that forum. Trustees are already compelled to act in the best interests of all members. Section 3 of the Act already makes it an offence for a trustee to fail to notify members where the Pensions Authority makes a direction for a scheme to restructure benefits. The object has to be to seek to get schemes into a recovery position.I am happy to say that has happened in respect of several schemes. I am fully aware that these are exceptionally difficult negotiations, particularly given the long and complex histories of several of the schemes. I do not have any power to act in respect of the industrial relations legislation. It is a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but I will certainly convey the views Members have expressed in this debate to him.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	354	The trustees were always required to inform members of reductions and so on. It has come to light that retired people and deferred members do not have the right to be consulted. They can be told that their pension will be decimated but one cannot have a say in the negotiations that might resolve that situation or contribute to improving it. The need to have that right and to represent a group of people has come to light in respect of some of the present schemes. We need to do more about that. I know this does not fall fully within the remit of the Minister here present but a commitment was made when the last Bill was passed to have discussions between the two Departments. The Minister says that officials in the Department of Social Protection have raised it with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation and it is under consideration. How hard is this to deal with? I do not wish to sound smart but the problem the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment has identified is that pensioners are dealing with their former employer. Technically, they are no longer employees. That is a problem in the way the Act is dealt with. How do such groups get representation? The Minister suggested ways around this, for example some employers have early retirement groups and there is an income stream which could be regarded as a link to overcome the problem. Just as trade unions can go to the Labour Court and use the State’s industrial relations machinery, there might be a code of practice on how pensioner groups could be regulated in the same way as trade unions, for elections and the right of all people to nominate their own representatives. They want to have a say, and not to be told after the event. Does the High Court have to be an option? It is intimidating, financially prohibitive, and in practice will not be used even if it is proposed as a positive step. I can say that with certainty because individuals who are not happy with the adjudications of the Pensions Ombudsman already have the right to go to the High Court and must do so within 21 days but that does not happen. The Equality Tribunal has dealt with pensions. There are ways around the problem if the will is there.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	I appreciate the Deputy’s interest in this and her detailed knowledge, given the constituency she represents. I also know many in all three categories - workers, people whose pensions are deferred and pensioners - and I understand their huge concern about their retirement pension. The legislative changes I have brought forward are an attempt to ensure that as many defined benefit schemes as possible are put in a recovery position. In many cases this involves detailed negotiations and discussions. I believe that is possible. It may well be that once this period of extraordinary difficulty is over and we move further into recovery, renegotiated schemes will help the firms that gave rise to the schemes recover financially and have a stable future, which is extremely important, not just for the people who work in some of these companies but for the whole Irish economy. It is a very complex and challenging situation. There have been discussions between the Departments of Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I will raise the issues again with the Minister. It is most important to get as many schemes as possible across the line satisfactorily, even if that is a very difficult negotiation.

As they will be aware, the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the merger of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency this summer. The necessary legal provisions for this, which are set out in the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, need to be in place before the Oireachtas rises for the summer recess. Having listened to all the concerns that have been raised, I want to assure the House that the merger will not in any way result in a diminution, or even a perception of a diminution, of our commitment to radiological protection. I believe the merging of the two organisations will enhance our capacity to continue to deliver regulatory and advisory functions to the highest standard, while fostering greater synergies and links between radiological and environmental policies and actions into the future. We are not in any way diminishing the protection or priorities afforded to radiological issues. The establishment of the office of radiological protection will maintain the positive profile and high reputation of the institute. The future of the Sellafield nuclear site was raised during the debate. Ireland has ongoing engagements with the United Kingdom on radiological and nuclear matters. Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and technical experts from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland meet their counterparts from the UK Department of Environment and Climate Change regularly. At these meetings, we ensure the UK authorities are kept aware of any concerns held by Ireland and emphasise that all possible steps are taken to ensure the highest levels of safety apply at Sellafield and all other relevant nuclear sites. In November 2012, the Department published a summary of a probabilistic risk assessment report that was prepared by an independent team of international experts who assessed the probable risks to Ireland of any potential incidents at Sellafield. The experts quantified the likelihood of an incident at Sellafield resulting in the release of radioactive material. They found that such an incident would give rise to "no observable health effects". The merger of the two bodies will in no way lessen or reduce the current high level of scrutiny that applies to the Sellafield issue. A further visit to the Sellafield site by representatives of the Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is being arranged for later this year. The Government's primary approach to dealing with radon is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed. The national radon control strategy sets out 48 recommendations, under six thematic areas, with the ultimate aim of reducing the number of radon related lung cancer cases. Successful implementation of the strategy will require action from a range of Departments, public bodies and stakeholders. A co-ordinating group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and including representatives of other key Departments and agencies, has been established to implement and track key recommendations from the strategy. It will monitor the implementation of the strategy and report annually on progress. In 2018, at the end of the four-year period covered by the national radon control strategy action plan, the group will make recommendations on further actions that should be taken at that time. I assure Deputies that the comprehensive action plan being implemented will not be adversely impacted by this merger in any way. The ultimate aim of the Government's agency rationalisation programme is to reduce the number of State bodies and integrate their roles and responsibilities with other existing bodies, with consequent efficiency savings. While the savings from some rationalisations might not be significant, there is a policy of following through on mergers and rationalisations unless there are strong evidence-based reasons for not doing so. In the case of this merger, it is clear that greater synergies and links between the environmental and radiological functions will enhance capacity. The savings that have been identified and estimated will begin at a low level in 2014 and will increase in 2015 and 2016 as these synergies become embedded. The savings arise mainly under the themes of human resources, governance and the administrative cost savings that are forecast across the corporate services area. Smaller savings will arise under the areas of information and communications technology and accommodation. Cost savings of up to €260,000 per annum are anticipated from 2016. This figure already incorporates recognition of staff efficiencies of approximately €100,000 per annum. Further workforce planning, including a review of structures, roles and responsibilities, will be completed later this year. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provided €70,000 in capital funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 in respect of the merger. Additional allocations of €696,000 for current funding and €223,000 for capital funding have been made for 2014 in respect of merger costs. This expenditure is required to facilitate the updating of human resource, information and communications technology systems, financial systems and accommodation facilities and to ensure a smooth operational transition. It was determined at the commencement of the merger process that the most efficient and cost-effective way to enable the merger was to establish a fifth office within the structure of the Environmental Protection Agency, namely, the Office of Radiological Protection. None of the existing divisions and offices within the agency is established specifically in legislation. The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides that "the Agency shall consist of a Director General and four other directors". That number will increase to five after the merger. As the 1992 Act provides that the function of the director general is "to arrange the distribution of the business of the Agency among its directors", it would not be appropriate or desirable for legislation to prescribe the divisional organisation of the agency, or to confer one of the offices with a more pre-eminent or differentiated status. A review of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was published in 2011, concluded that "the flexibility and change management shown by the EPA is a major strength" and "should not be limited by overly prescriptive statutory provisions". A number of Deputies raised concerns about the possible loss of radiological expertise. I assure the House that this will not arise. This matter is specifically addressed in the Bill, section 21 of which provides for a person with "relevant experience in relation to radiological protection" to be included on the statutory selection committee for directors of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Bill also provides that the Minister may appoint people with radiological expertise to the agency's general statutory advisory committee, which was established under section 27 of the 1992 Act. This committee will also be given the statutory ability to give advice on radiological protection matters. A separate specialist advisory committee, which will be dedicated solely to radiological protection, will be set up by the end of the year. The second purpose of the Bill is to put in place urgently the provisions required for Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. This amending treaty will be a cornerstone of international nuclear security measures. Ireland has long maintained a policy position of encouraging the highest international standards in this area. It is important to support our words with actions through the ratification of this treaty. I thank Deputies again for their positive and constructive input. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate, which is to take place next week.

I am pleased to introduce the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Bill 2013 for the consideration of the House. The Bill is one of a number of legislative priorities that are being pursued in my Department. Its aim is to update and modernise ship registration legislation and enhance the safety of ships that operate domestically in Irish waters. The Bill recognises the importance of maritime safety given our island status and the need to ensure the safety of maritime transport services generally. International maritime law, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, requires that every state fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, registration of ships in its territory and the right to fly its flag. Ship registration is about conferring Irish nationality on ships, allowing them to fly the Irish flag and registering ownership. Our existing ship registration regime dates from 1955, the main Act being the Mercantile Marine Act 1955. It forms part of a wide-ranging code of maritime legislation that dates from 1894. Under the provisions of the 1955 Act, as amended in 1998 and 2006, ships wholly owned by an Irish citizen or an Irish body corporate are obliged to register. Exemptions to this obligation include ships not exceeding 15 net tonnes and which navigate in particular areas, sea-fishing boats less than 15 m in length overall, and ships owned by Irish citizens not ordinarily resident in the State. As the flag state, Ireland has obligations in respect of ships on its register wherever in the world they travel, including in regard to any serious marine incident in which they may be involved. This highlights the importance of ensuring ships flying our flag are safe and seaworthy. The need for an updated ship registration system has been growing against a background of international growth in maritime trade, an increase in the use of pleasure craft and an increasing emphasis on safety, security and environmental issues both at EU and international level. The Bill before us today is the outcome of a detailed review involving an extensive public consultation process, correspondence and meetings with interested stakeholders, as well as engagement with relevant Departments. It has been prepared mindful of the efforts of the International Maritime Organisation and the European Union, in particular, to enhance the safety of ships and prevent pollution from ships by addressing the issues of substandard ships and the obligations of states in regard to ships that fly their flag The underlying focus of the Bill is a continuing desire and commitment as a maritime nation to achieve and maintain a fleet of Irish-flagged vessels that is safe. At the same time, the Bill provides a legislative basis for the establishment and regulation of a modern ship registration system around a new, centralised, electronic and accessible national ship register. It is hoped that the revised approach to ship registration will enable enhanced accuracy of central records of Irish ships and ships operating in Irish waters and assist in ship and owner identification, including to the benefit of search and rescue or other emergency operations. The motivation behind the Bill, therefore, is not simply to update the legislation but also to improve the way in which ships are registered, the administrative process involved and the manner in which ship registration records are stored. Under the 1955 Act, my Department is the national authority with responsibility for the registration of Irish ships, although the statutory ship registration role is assigned to the Revenue Commissioners. Local registrars, who are Revenue officials, administer the registration process in 11 locations throughout the country. Each registrar maintains a register book to record all registration transactions that occur in respect of the port of registry for which he or she is responsible. There are 13 ports of registry designated under the 1955 Act at present. The local registrars hold all of the original official ship registration records and send details of entries in the register books to the mercantile marine office of my Department. There are currently more than 3,200 ships registered in Ireland on the national ship register. The new electronic Irish register of ships will consist of different parts for the registration of different types of ships and for different registration purposes, such as visitor registration. The electronic register will facilitate easier access to ship registration information and thereby enable the generation of statistical information and reports about the make-up of the Irish fleet. The Bill also addresses gaps in the existing legislation such as the absence of a specific power to remove unsafe or unsuitable ships from the register, the absence of ship registration renewal and outdated enforcement and penalty provisions. As well as addressing these gaps, the Bill provides for improvements such as an extension of mandatory ship registration to additional ship categories, including fishing boats less than 15 m in length overall, personal watercraft such as jet skis, small fast-powered craft and some small commercial angling boats. Subject to some exemptions, all ships operating domestically will be required to be on the register or have a current valid registration conferring nationality from another country. The comprehensive legislative framework provided by the Bill will be supported by secondary legislation which will provide the detail of the ship registration requirements. This will facilitate further evolution and improvement in the future if the need arises, including a potential to respond quickly to any emerging policy issues of concern at a domestic, EU or international level. The regulations will be finalised following the enactment of the Bill. I now turn to the content of the Bill, which is divided into nine Parts and has four Schedules.Part 1, sections 1 to 8, inclusive, contain standard provisions, including interpretation, fees, expenses, regulations, repeals and revocations. On fees, a scale of charges based on the categorisation, size and use of ships is proposed. The levels have yet to be decided and, in accordance with section 3, will be prescribed in regulations to be made with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  At this point, it is not anticipated that the current maximum registration fee levels in the range of €201 to €251 will be exceeded. The registration fee for the new ship categories, such as personal watercraft or small fast-powered craft, will be less than the registration fee for large commercially operating ships. A fee structure under €100 is envisaged for smaller vessels. There will be renewal of registration up to five years after initial registration and up to every ten years after that. It is anticipated that renewal fees will be lower than the initial registration fee, in particular in cases where there has been no changes made to the ship in the intervening period. The fee for visitor registration will be a nominal fee, probably under €50, and a simplified and straightforward application process is proposed so as not to impact negatively on tourism. Part 2 deals with registration of ships. The framework for the new Irish register of ships, the new ship registration process and its administration is established in sections 9 to 32, inclusive. The modernised central Irish register of ships to replace the existing primarily paper based system will be established under section 9. In line with e-Govemment policy, an electronic register is proposed consisting of separate parts for the registration of different ship categories and for different types of registration. The detail of the structure of the register and the different registration requirements for each part of the register will be set out in the regulations to be made under the Bill. At this point, it is envisaged that some parts of the register will be established and implemented on a phased basis. The current thinking on the structure of the register is that there will be a part for new passenger and commercial ships, existing large passenger and commercial ships 24 m in length and greater and the larger recreational craft. A second part will be for licensed sea-fishing boats, a distinction being made between fishing boats over and under 15 m in length. A third part will include the registration of existing passenger and commercial ships less than 24 m as well as personal watercraft, small fast-powered craft and small commercial angling boats. A fourth part will contain the detail of ships that are the subject of visitor registration or a temporary registration and there will be a part for information on undischarged registered mortgages in respect of ships that have been removed from the register. A facility to initiate ship registrations online is envisaged and it should be possible to substantially complete many straightforward renewals in this way. However, given the nature of ship registration and some of the documents required, it will be necessary to maintain some element of paper documentation in the registration process. The new register will be maintained by my Department and the Bill allows for the designation of officers of my Department, of another Minister and officers of the Revenue Commissioners to be registrars of ships to administer the register.  Section 10 provides for service agreements with State agencies to undertake elements of the ship registration administration process, if the need arises in the future. If this happens, officers of the State agency can also be designated as registrars of ships. Given our international responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the need to retain control over the registration of ships on the Irish flag, it is not proposed to outsource the entire ship registration process. The administration of ship registration will have to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and any regulations made under it. Section 11 sets out the ship registration requirements that will apply to ships that operate domestically. Arising from the Bill, mandatory registration will be extended to personal watercraft such as jet skis, small fast-powered craft and all commercial angling boats regardless of size. Other recreational craft less than 24 m in load line length, including small angling boats used solely for recreational purposes, will not be required to register. However, owners of such vessels may register voluntarily if they so wish. To underpin compliance with safety standards, registration will also be extended to fishing boats less than 15 m in length overall. When commenced, the provisions of the Bill will result in the majority of ships operating domestically in Irish waters being required to be registered. The extension of mandatory registration to high risk vessels, such as personal watercraft and small fast-powered craft, is a response to the growth in their use in recent years and the need, in the interests of safety, to exercise some degree of control over them.  The policy decision involved also responds to and implements recent recommendations of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in regard to the registration of jet skis. The 2013 Irish Coast Guard statistics show that incidents of jet skis requiring assistance were up 189% on 2012, perhaps due, in part, to the good summer we had last year but also because of the proliferation of these craft. Registration will act as a support to general maritime law enforcement and make it easier to prosecute offending users through the identification of owners. A simple form of registration is envisaged for personal watercraft and small fast-powered craft operating domestically. As a result of the new provisions contained in the Bill, a registration requirement will apply to all passenger and commercial ships and boats, recreational craft 24 m and greater in load line length; all fishing boats that hold or are required to hold a sea-fishing boat licence granted under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003; personal watercraft, including jet skis, small fast-powered craft; and all commercial angling boats, including certain small angling boats carrying no more than three passengers that are exempt from the requirement to have a passenger boat licence. State-owned ships in the relevant categories will be required to be registered but, consistent with international practice, warships will continue to be exempt from registration. As mentioned earlier, a current valid registration conferring nationality from another state will be an acceptable form of registration.  Arising from section 12, to be entitled to register, the ship owner must be a qualified person in accordance with section 15 and the ship must comply with prescribed conditions or other requirements which may relate to such matters as safety, environment and security, type, age, size, and trading pattern. These provisions will reinforce the standards required for registration and allow the State to exercise greater control over the condition of ships that choose to register on the Irish register of ships. All Irish ships will have to have their operations controlled and directed from within the State, although different requirements will apply to the different categories and types of ships. Under section 14, ships that are registered on the existing register books when the new Irish register of ships is established will be automatically transferred to the appropriate part of the new register free of charge and, subject to compliance with the requirements of the Bill, will be registered for a period of up to five years from the date of transfer. Following this period, they will be subject to a requirement to renew registration at intervals of up to ten years in duration. To ensure equality of treatment, all ship registrations on the new register will be for a period of up to five years, be they existing registered ships that are transferring to the new register or ships registering for the first time. The renewal requirement will allow transferred ships that have ceased to exist to be removed from the register when their registration is not renewed and will ensure that such vessels will not remain on the register indefinitely, thus improving the accuracy of the register.  Persons known as qualified persons will be entitled to register their ships. As outlined in section 15, these include a ship owner who is an Irish citizen, a national of another EU member state and certain corporate bodies. Section 16 requires a qualified person who is not resident in the State or who does not have a registered office in the State to appoint a representative person who resides or has a presence in the State.  Registrars of ships will be designated under section 17 which allows for the continuing involvement of the existing registrars of ships, who are officers of the Revenue Commissioners, in the immediate term. It is proposed that this arrangement will continue until the new register and administrative system is in place and the necessary regulations that will flow from the Bill have been made.  Section 18 provides for the application for and grant of ship registration, including provisional registration where a ship is under construction and non-operative registration to allow for the certification or licensing of a ship, such as for a passenger boat certificate or a sea-fishing boat licence. The section enables the regulation of a range of matters connected to registration application requirements, including procedures, information, declarations and documentation. Section 19 provides for the renewal of ship registration which is one of a number of new initiatives being introduced. Renewal acts as a checking mechanism to ensure that ships continue to comply with any relevant safety certification or other requirements that apply to them. Section 20 requires the measurement of ships for the purposes of registration and the issuing of a certificate of measurement.  Another of the new concepts in this Bill is the introduction in section 21 of a facility to refuse to register a ship and to remove a ship from the register in a range of circumstances, including those relating to safety, pollution prevention, qualified persons and compliance with standards and conditions. These quality-driven measures, along with registration renewal, are being introduced in the interests of preserving the integrity and improving the accuracy of the register. An appeal process is provided for in specified circumstances, as outlined in section 22.Provision is made in section 23 for temporary registration of recreational craft under 24 m in load line length. That will accommodate the navigation of such vessels owned by a person normally resident in the State from another country to the State, and will ensure the ship is not detained for not being registered when in foreign waters where ships are required to be registered. Section 24 introduces the new category of visitor registration. That will accommodate ships that are not registered in another state, in particular non-commercial ships that wish to visit Ireland for short periods not exceeding three months, for example, persons on holiday or taking part in sporting events. It will only apply to personal watercraft, recreational craft 24 m in load line length and greater, small fast-powered craft and small commercial angling boats Without visitor registration, such craft would be required to have full registration on the register under section 11. Ships holding a visitor registration will not be known as Irish ships. A simplified registration process with a nominal fee is envisaged. The details of temporary and visitor registration will be set out in regulations to be made following the enactment of the Bill. As is the situation currently and common practice internationally, sections 25 and 26 provide for regulations to set out the requirements for the naming, carving and marking of ships in relation to a range of matters such as the official name or number of the vessel or the port of registry. Different carving and marking requirements will apply to different types of ships. Similarly, it is envisaged that the regulations on the naming of ships will allow for a variety of ship name requirements, as well as circumstances where a ship name may not be required for practical reasons in the case of particular types or sizes of ship. Sections 27 to 29, inclusive, address important issues relating to certificates of registry and requirements for carrying documentation on board the ship. It is normal practice for a ship to be registered by reference to a particular port of registry. In Ireland, there are 13 such ports and those are retained under section 30 and the associated Schedule 3. The Bill enables new ports of registry to be prescribed or a port to cease to be a port of registry. Section 30(2) sets out the considerations that would inform such a decision. Section 31 facilitates the transfer of the port of registry of a ship from one port of registry in the State to another. Historically, ports of registry were chosen because they were the locations of the local registrars. A ship owner can choose a port of registry from any of the 13 ports, which are Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Skibbereen, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford, Westport and Wexford. However, with the introduction of a central electronic register of ships, the ports of registry will continue in name only. Part 3 deals with Irish ships and their national colour and character. Sections 33 to 38, inclusive, clarify which ships may be known as Irish ships, and the requirements that apply to the flying of flags by such ships. These include prohibitions on hoisting flags other than the national flag, on pretending to be an Irish ship, on concealing Irish character, and on assuming foreign character. The provisions are mainly based on the existing legislative requirements. Section 37 deals with offences relating to using or assuming Irish national character on a ship that is not Irish. Part 4 deals with enforcement, which includes a number of improvements to the existing ship registration code under the Mercantile Marine Act 1955 where enforcement and penalties are limited. To address the situation, a number of changes are proposed, including an increase in penalty levels, authorised persons for enforcement purposes, the introduction of a system of fixed payments for certain offences involving personal watercraft, small fast-powered craft and small commercial angling boats, and a power of detention for marine surveyors for ship registration related offences. A range of State personnel who are likely to come across breaches of ship registration requirements in the course of their normal day-to-day activities are designated as authorised persons under section 39 for practical operational reasons. The powers of the authorised persons are set out in section 40. These provisions enable enforcement of the Bill by marine surveyors of my Department, an officer of the Irish Coast Guard and the Revenue Commissioners, a member of the Garda Síochána, a harbour master or a sea fisheries protection officer, certain Defence Forces personnel and an authorised officer of Inland Fisheries Ireland. Section 41 introduces powers of detention for marine surveyors in relation to a ship in a port in the State or in Irish waters, or an Irish ship in a foreign port, where breaches of specified sections of the Bill arise relating to registration requirements, the carving and marking of the ship, the certificate of registry of the ship, falsely assuming Irish nationality or intent to conceal Irish national character or assuming a foreign character. It is not envisaged that this power of detention will be used except in very serious situations. A system of fixed payments in lieu of prosecution for certain offences is provided for in section 42. That may be used for offences involving failure to register smaller vessels such as personal watercraft, small fast-powered craft and certain small commercial angling boats. Fixed payment notices may be issued by the authorised persons provided for in section 39 and by an authorised person appointed by a local authority under section 17 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005. Similar to the approach in the 2005 Act relating to breaches of safety by-laws or the operation of craft, the fixed payment notice will indicate that the person is alleged to have committed an offence, and if the payment specified in the notice, that is, €150 or such other prescribed amount, is made within 21 days of the date of the notice, court proceedings will not be initiated. Prosecution may be brought by the local authority concerned, Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, depending on who serves the notice. That is a more practical approach to enforcement than court prosecution for registration offence cases that involve small vessels. Part 5 relates to legal issues. Sections 43 to 47, inclusive, carry forward general legal provisions in the Mercantile Marine Act 1955 relating to documentary evidence and declarations related to ship registration. Part 6 deals with private law provisions. Part 6 consists of sections 48 to 62, inclusive. It carries forward and updates where necessary a range of private law provisions for registered ships that were contained in the Mercantile Marine Act 1955. Those relate to title, ownership, transfer of ships, and mortgages on ships. Part 7 relates to proceedings. Linked to improved enforcement under the Bill, sections 63 to 67, inclusive, contain provisions about proceedings for offences, summary penalties and the liability of both the owner and the master of a ship when certain offences are committed. Section 63 provides for prosecution proceedings under the Bill, the recovery of prosecution costs and the payment and disposal of fines. Summary prosecution proceedings may be initiated by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and, in the case of ship registration offences relating to personal watercraft, small fast-powered craft and certain small angling boats, by the local authority concerned or Inland Fisheries Ireland. That recognises the important role local authorities and the IFI can play given their location and activity on the ground throughout the country. It also adds to the ship registration enforcement capability. As provided for in section 64, summary conviction, except where provided otherwise in the Bill, will give rise to a maximum fine of €5,000. That updates the penalties under the 1955 regime which do not exceed €635 on successful prosecution. Section 65 allows for the prosecution of both the owner and master of a ship in the case of certain specified offences linked to the carrying of a certificate of registry and related documentation, concealing the Irish national character of a ship, or assuming a foreign character. Offences committed by a body corporate are dealt with in section 66. Part 8 relates to consequential amendments. The purpose of section 68 and the associated Schedule 4 is to provide for consequential amendments to a broad range of legislation. The majority of the amendments arise from the repeal of the provisions of the Mercantile Marine Act 1955 and the need to replace the references to it in the listed Acts with references to the new Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act. Part 9 deals with the safety convention. Section 69 provides for a small amendment to the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952 to update the definition of "Safety Convention" which relates to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS. The definition was last updated in the Merchant Shipping Act 2010 and needs to be further updated to facilitate the transposition and implementation of convention amendments agreed in May 2012 into Irish secondary legislation. Schedule 1 deals with repeals. This Schedule and the associated section 7 provide for the repeal of a number of specified enactments, in whole or in part, that is, the whole of the Mercantile Marine Act 1955 and subsequent amendments to that Act in 1998 and 2006. The provisions of the current Bill will replace the 1955 Act, as amended. Schedule 2, which deals with revocations, and the associated section 8 revoke a number of statutory instruments as a consequence of the repeal of the Mercantile Marine Act 1955. The statutory instruments were made under the 1955 Act and will no longer be required following the enactment of the Bill. Schedule 3 relates to ports of registry. It is linked to section 30. Schedule 3 lists the ports of registry in the State for ship registration purposes. It comprises the 13 existing ports of registry. Schedule 4, and the associated section 68, provide for amendments to a range of existing Acts arising from the introduction of the Bill. The amendments relate primarily to references in those Acts to the Mercantile Marine Act 1955, to an Irish ship, a registered ship, an owner of a ship, a port of registry, tonnage regulations or issues around load line certification. The aim in presenting this Bill for the consideration of the House is to replace, update and modernise the ship registration regime which dates from the mid-1950s, as well as to enhance in the public interest the safety of ships that operate domestically in Irish waters and that fly the Irish flag. This aim is progressed by placing a particular focus on maritime safety at the heart of ship registration requirements and providing a legislative framework for several new initiatives, including a modernised registration process incorporating the new central electronic register of ships. The introduction of ship registration renewal and the capacity to remove unsafe ships from the register, along with additional enforcement provisions, should improve the overall accuracy of the register. Given time, I expect the policy considerations that drove the development of this Bill will see fruition and deliver an improved register of ships and registration system, as well as enhanced safety on Irish flagged ships, all of which will be to the mutual benefit of the public, ship owners, the environment and the State as a whole. I commend the Bill to the House.

As an island nation, Ireland is heavily dependent on the merchant shipping industry. The current proposals were initiated in 2008 when then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, launched a national consultation on the registration of vessels with the objective of developing a modern, comprehensive central register. In particular, Fianna Fáil welcomes the fact this Bill will require registration of jet skis in Irish waters for the first time. We need to ensure our regulations surrounding the merchant shipping sector are effective, straightforward and promote good practice on our seas. The majority of goods and services which we import are carried by ship. Shipping lanes and the ships which carry those goods and services are the lifeblood of our economy. As such, they must be regulated in the most comprehensive fashion. For our economy to remain competitive, the ships which transport our goods to the world and which import goods from other countries must be allowed play on a level playing field. The legislation before the House goes some way in updating the Statute Book to ensure our shipping sector is governed by laws which reflect the needs of the 21st century. We welcome the purpose of this Bill and agree with the need to update, restate and clarify the law on the registration of vessels. Ship registration is an important process for an island nation. It is important our ships, as well those which enter our waters, are documented, flagged and given nationality. The fact the nationality of a ship allows a ship to travel internationally as it is proof of ownership of the vessel is a key aspect in controlling the fleet of ships in this country. The ship registration in question applies to both domestic and international ships. On this front, it is vitally important the registration fees surrounding merchant shipping are kept in line with the international standard so as not to disadvantage Irish-registered ships in this competitive sector. Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill's expansion of the categories of vessels to be registered. In particular, we welcome the inclusion of jet skis, given the many incidents which have threatened the safety of people using the sea. Will the Minister outline further what controls, if any, will be introduced surrounding the use of jet skis? Up to 123 people lost their lives in shipping or boating accidents between 2002 and 2012. It is important to recognise and regulate dangerous activity on our waters and take steps to prevent same. Members are familiar with the misuse of jet skis in coastal areas and on our inland waterways. If I recall correctly, local authorities can introduce by-laws to deal with the misuse of jet skis which can cause much annoyance to other water users. The fine weather we are having will obviously bring out people who want to enjoy leisure activities on the water. It will also bring out those who use jet skis. It is vitally important appropriate sanctions are in place to deal with those who act in a way that is a nuisance to other water users. The chief executive of Irish Water Safety, Mr. John Leech, stated it has been calling for the registration of jet skis for more than 15 years. It is good to see that finally that will happen. Jet skis are extremely powerful and can accelerate as fast as a motorbike. If used improperly, they can be terribly dangerous. Many of the people who use them have no training whatsoever, which has resulted in deaths and numerous injuries, not just to users but others in their vicinity. It is important registration is not seen as an end in itself surrounding maritime safety. The resources must be made available to ensure good maritime practice is observed and that the Bill’s legislative provisions are enforced. Will the Minister assure the House of these matters before the end of Second Stage? The key elements of the Bill are necessary updates to existing legislation. We welcome the new planned central system for registration of ships. We hope this will make ship registration more efficient and provide a more complete and comprehensive database for the State authorities. The repeal, replacement and updating of the existing legislation, primarily the Mercantile Marine Act 1955, is also well overdue. The fact registration lasts the first time for five years, and on satisfactory completion and renewal for ten-year periods thereafter, makes sense. It is a straightforward way of ensuring the register is up to date. The emphasis surrounding the national colours for a registered Irish ship are necessary. It is often disappointing to see some of our vessels do not seem to take pride in the national flag and fail to display it on their ships. As a nation which fought so hard for our independence, the display of our national flag should be a matter in which we take care and pride. I welcome the provision outlining the necessity that the flag must be hoisted for identification purposes. The application of these legislative provisions to foreign ships in Irish waters and ports is also welcome. I note the Irish Sailing Association, ISA, welcomed the publication of the Bill, stating: "The ISA has for a long time been campaigning for a statutory register that may be made available for recreational craft as required." It is important to get the relevant stakeholders to buy into this legislation fully and ensure they are aware of what is required from them when this Bill is passed. Will the Minister explain how he intends to interact with those stakeholders to ensure they are familiar with all the Bill’s legislative aspects? Recreational crafts and transport vessels need to be made aware of the changes that will be implemented. I hope the Minister will ensure the legislative provisions which affect foreign-registered ships will be publicised in a way to ensure awareness and compliance. I reiterate the support of my party for what the Minister is doing with the legislation before the House. I hope he will take on board my comments which are intended to be helpful and constructive and commend him on the work he has carried out on this legislation so far.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I welcome this Bill. Coming from a maritime county, I am very much aware of the different types of ships and boats that operate in our waters. This Bill is a long time coming. As Deputy Dooley said, Noel Dempsey, when Minister for Transport, launched a national consultation process on the registration of maritime vessels with the objective of developing a modern, comprehensive and centralised register.This is what the Minister will implement. The purpose of the Bill is to update, restate and clarify the law on the registration of vessels. Ship registration is the process by which ships are documented, flagged and given nationality. The nationality allows a ship to travel internationally as it is proof of ownership of the vessel, and ship registration applies to domestic and international ships. We welcome the fact the Bill will expand the categories of vessels to include jet skis. The situation regarding jet skis has been of major concern, particularly along the coastline, for quite a number of years. Every year Courtown in County Wexford has an influx of jet skis, and how the owners operate them has caused enormous concern for those who use the quiet beaches of Courtown and other parts of County Wexford. There has been no regulation or control and much anti-social behaviour by the owners of jet skis. More important, there have been a number of accidents resulting in people having to go to Wexford hospital and other hospitals in the area, which in itself causes major problems. I welcome the fact jet skis will be dealt with. We need very strong legislation and it needs to be implemented by various strands of the organisations in each county, with the Garda being the main organisation. Local authority beach officers and other people who work the beaches during the summer should have a certain amount of power to take on those who do not operate jet skis in a respectful way. Serious concern has been raised over the years and I welcome the fact the Minister will deal with it effectively. I missed the first part of the Minister's speech, but I am not aware of anything in the Bill about workers' rights. I do not know how he will deal with this. Many foreign ships come to Ireland and to the ports in Waterford and Dublin. Workers may not have been paid for weeks on end but we do not seem to have any control when this happens in Irish territorial waters. Can anything be put into legislation to deal with it? Usually the ship is left there for quite some time and the workers sit in protest, but no one seems to be able to make a decision on whether these workers will be paid. Serious concern has been expressed at Rosslare Port in particular. Recently I received a letter from workers in Rosslare Port with a heading regarding a threat to Irish seafarers' jobs on the Stena Line ferries. They feel that changes coming about will mean the jobs of Irish people will be replaced by yellow pack workers. Stena Line is seeking a 10% reduction in salaries over the next two years and a 10% reduction in employment. It is speaking about outsourcing the work. This will create serious problems for people in my constituency in particular. How can this be dealt with and how can the rights of workers be protected? There seems to be alarming concern about how workers are treated on ships, not only in Ireland but internationally. They do not seem to have any great workers' rights or conditions or adequate payment. It is not the Minister's fault, and no Minister has dealt with it, but perhaps the time has come to put it on the agenda and see how we can deal with it. I welcome the fact the 1955 law on ship registration will be updated in the Bill. As Deputy Dooley stated, it is important that ships fly the Irish flag with pride. When one goes to Amsterdam or other ports outside Ireland one sees ships flying the national colours with pride. I am sure the Irish Maritime Development Office is very supportive of the Minister. Does it still have a role in promoting and assisting the development of Irish shipping, shipping services and seafarer training; liaising with, supporting and marketing the shipping and shipping services sector; and advising the Minister on the development and co-ordination of policy in the shipping and shipping services sector? What role did it play in the legislation before us? Is it still on the ball? It was very good in the past and I am sure it is still the same. In August 2013 a press release was issued stating a global shipping hub was planned for the Dublin docklands on the scale of the IFSC. I believe a private consortium put together the proposal to develop it. Coming from a maritime county I think it is a great idea and it should be supported by the Government, the IDA and other State agencies. When the Minister, replies will he tell us what stage this is that? It would be a very important development now that the Minister is introducing legislation to control and ensure our ships are registered, safe and up to date. Such a development would be an opportunity. We are a maritime country. It was stated that up to 3,500 jobs could be created, and in the current climate we could certainly do with this. It is important that the project be nursed along and brought to fruition as quickly as possible. Overall I welcome the fact the Bill is before the House and that the legislation will deal with the registration of ships, safety, jet skis, ensuring ships are up to standard and safe and that those using them can travel in the knowledge their lives will not be at risk and legislation is in place to ensure their rights are protected. I welcome the Bill. When the Minister replies, will he speak about job protection and the rights of workers on ships?

Cuirim fáilte roimhe. This is a positive straightforward Bill which introduces a system of registration which is long overdue but very welcome. I am happy to speak on it. I am sure the Minister will agree it is long overdue and will take no offence when I state we required this type of legislation long before he came into office. From what I can see, the idea of a register has been welcomed by all involved in the shipping industry, including the Irish Marine Federation. When a craft is registered in Ireland, it is allowed to confirm its nationality and fly the Irish flag. The Bill will modernise the registration process, allowing for a better log of who and what is operating in our waters and under our flag. Another important modern issue dealt with in the Bill is the need to register specifically as personal watercraft small fast-powered craft as well as ordinary small fishing and angling boats. Such craft, in particular jet skis, are now a regular feature in the bays and waterways of our country. At this time of year, with weather such as we are having, it is not uncommon to find these small fast-powered personal craft in operation. This is the key to why it is important we have a registration system. Regardless of their leisurely purpose, these are powerful craft which must be operated with the utmost regard for public safety. Everyone has heard, at least in passing, of tragedies involving jet skis. It is the responsibility of the State to ensure as much as possible that when these vessels are operated, they are in the control of responsible people who know what they are doing. We are behind many countries in this regard.Such countries recognised before we did that there must be a registration process, as well as proper checks and balances, to ensure those who have such craft use them in a responsible way. While many of the stories I have heard come from holiday destinations from far afield where such vessels long have been commonplace, local cases also highlight the importance of safety and the case of Mr. Alan Joyce is one such example. This young man died as a result of an accident while using a jet ski. A Marine Casualty Investigation Board inquiry into his death on Lough Beltra, County Mayo, found the craft he was operating should be licensed and that those using jet skis should be obliged to complete a mandatory training course. I definitely support this suggestion. The inquiry also found that those using jet skis that day did not receive training, were known to be poor swimmers and were not wearing lifejackets. This kind of failure to apply safety standards that would be the norm in other fields is a clear example of the need for the State to step in with regulation. Safety on the water is key and to my mind is the most important part of this Bill. Members have debated the need for proper safety measures at sea for fishermen a number of times in the Dáil. Almost a year ago to the day, I secured a Topical Issues debate on marine safety. The Minister might recall I raised the need for personal beacons for fishermen, which could be integrated into their lifejackets or worn as wristbands. This could be done in a number of ways. The Minister might also remember this issue as it was raised twice by my colleague, Senator Cullinane, who hails from County Waterford where these are real issues and many locals have lost loved ones to the sea. Anything Members can do to improve safety at sea both for fishermen and those who use pleasure craft should be considered. The wearing of lifejackets is essential. Irish people sometimes can have cavalier attitudes to their personal safety but they also have shown a great ability to change when an impetus to do the smart and safe thing is given. This can be seen in the introduction of seat belts, the smoking ban and the crackdown on drink driving. Standard mandatory requirements are needed for those who use these craft for pleasure purposes to minimise whatever threats or health and safety concerns might arise. The enhanced regulation of road safety, as well as a long public awareness campaign, brought about a stark shift in attitudes to safety among the public in these fields. Regulation can be used to improve safety standards in maritime life. One cannot ride a motorbike without a helmet, licence or insurance, and therefore it should be no different for a powerful and potentially dangerous craft at sea. In particular, jet skis must have strict regulations placed on them, not to criminalise those who use them but to discourage and punish misuse. This is in the interests of all involved, as are road safety issues to both driver and pedestrian. However, despite my support for the Bill overall, I wish to speak in opposition to a trend I note has continued in this Bill and which has been a feature of current Government policy. That trend is the outsourcing of work which should be done by local authorities or other agencies under the State. The registration process should be carried out by a State agency, not a profit-making private body. In recent months, there has been the outworking of plans to privatise bus services. These moves are nonsensical, do not offer value for money and, in general, lead to a decrease in the quality and accessibility of service. This has been the case for driver licences as well. The current Administration in particular seeks to remove the State's responsibility from as many matters as possible. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, at present is trying to redefine social housing out of existence. It is in the interest of the public at large that a proper ship registration process is in place. It should not be a money-making exercise. At some point in his term of office, I hope the Minister will return with improved regulation for fishing vessels, having taken on board some of the points I made earlier about personal beacons. The Minister has done some work on the use of beacons on boats and improvements in that area, which is of huge importance. There have been far too many tragedies off our coasts and lessons are not being learned from them. Some of them could have been avoided had we had better safety equipment standards on boats and in respect of those who use them. I will support anything that will improve health and safety at sea. Maritime safety is most important, but since the 1950s, there has been no proper updating or enhancing of the legislative code for the national maritime sector, and this is long overdue. We are an island nation that depends on its ability to trade with other countries through its exports and imports. We need the highest standards with regard to registration, logging and monitoring, as well as the environmental issues, such as pollution, which have been experienced here every now and again. The ability to monitor the conditions of ships and other smaller vessels is important, given the number of accidents that have happened at sea and in our waterways. Search and rescue operations depend on a quick response, and this Bill also helps in making it easier to find a vessel through the registration and other methods proposed, which can help to monitor as well as meet international laws and best practices. The ability to access online registration is also welcome. Fees must be reasonable, and while the Minister did not provide Members with details, it is important that Members have some idea about the fees and that they are fairly reasonable. I also agree that registration should be mandatory in these cases because this will help to provide a proper way to weed out those who are acting illegally. As for the consultation process, I am unclear as to whether many objections were received, but from the consultation process it appears as though most people were in agreement with much of what has been said. The manner in which the message from this Bill is disseminated is important because that will be a key to pulling in the horns of some of those who would abuse this, particularly those who would use jet skis on beaches. Members often will have seen instances of people driving up in cars onto sand and other places. It is not merely about the problem they create on the sea but also about when they come onto the beaches. The power of seizure should be considered by the Minister in the context of how to deal with such vehicles. Consideration also should be given to who could be authorised to seize such vehicles, be they members of the Garda or others. I generally support this Bill and look forward to its passage.

I welcome this debate as everyone must be vigilant in respect of shipping vessels, but I also believe in the importance of the seas, the fishing industry and the huge potential to develop further Ireland's tourism industry based on an island economy. It is important to make such points with regard to this legislation. Before coming to the details of this legislation, it is important to put down a few markers about the importance of the sea and of shipping in general. It is also important to highlight the issue of safety for sailors and fishermen, as well as the issue of the coast being used by gangs to bring in drugs to this country and as a gateway to the rest of Europe. This also is an issue which Members must keep an eye on. I also represent a coastal constituency, the new constituency of Dublin Bay North, which stretches from Fairview through Clontarf and Sutton out as far as Howth, and consequently I will keep a close eye on all issues relating to the sea and on legislation like this. When one considers the details of this legislation carefully, one will note the purpose of the Bill is to update, restate and clarify the law on the registration of vessels. Ship registration is the process by which a ship is documented, flagged and given nationality.The nationality allows a ship to travel internationally as it is proof of ownership of the vessel. Ship registration applies to both domestic and international ships. The Bill expands the categories of vessels to be registered. This is a welcome provision. As I mentioned I represent a very important valuable State asset which is Dublin Bay and which is important to the people of Clontarf but also to the nation. For many years we had to fight to preserve Dublin Bay, in particular the 52 acres. The former Independent Deputy for my area was the great Seán Dublin Bay Loftus. He was elected on that issue. I wish to reassure the Minister and the Government that the tradition will continue. We will fight to protect and defend Dublin Bay at all costs. In City Hall we have people like Councillor Damien O'Farrell, the new Independent councillor who had the highest vote in the local elections in Dublin city. He will also be a watchdog in the protection of Dublin Bay. A number of my colleagues spoke about the issue of safety in the seas with particular reference to the use of jet skis which is becoming out of control. There is a potential for more accidents if the use of jet skis is not regulated in bays and harbours and as I noted in Lough Derg, on our lakes. Public safety must be the priority and we need to keep a close eye on these Speedy Gonzalez merchants who sometimes exploit our bays, rivers and lakes.

The Bill repeals, replaces and updates the existing legislation, primarily the Mercantile Marine Act 1955. Under the existing system, there are numerous registers and registrars and these will be replaced by one centralised Irish register of ships. The initial registration lasts for five years and on satisfactory completion and renewal, for ten-year periods thereafter. The national colours for a registered Irish ship, unless special exception is made, are the colours of the Irish national flag. There are times when the flag must be hoisted for identification purposes. Though predominantly affecting Irish ships, both in Irish waters and foreign ports, parts of the Bill also apply to foreign ships in Irish waters and ports. There is a need to keep a close eye on the interests of the fishing industry which is connected to this legislation. In my new constituency I represent Howth which is an amazing place. I encourage the Minister to go there to see the beautiful-----

I will defend and stand up for the fishermen and the fishing industry in Howth. I will also strongly support those involved in tourism and the leisure industry which have significant potential and which have been neglected by this Government. We need to stand up and attract more investment and regard places like Howth as a national resource and a national treasure. Many people are concerned about the damage and suffering inflicted by the European Union on the fishing industry. Part of my remit will be to stand up for that issue because it is all linked into the debate on Ireland being an island economy which needs strong voices both in the Oireachtas and in Europe. I refer to the Ocean Wealth conference held today in Dublin Castle at which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, spoke on the subject of our natural resources. He announced a new tax regime for offshore petroleum exploration. I was optimistic that he had listened to many colleagues like Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and Deputy Joe Higgins about the massive wealth in our seas and the opportunity to tax offshore exploration. International experts in the sector, Wood Mackenzie, were engaged to provide that advice. I question whether he has got the best international advice available. The Minister stated there will be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing exploration authorisations. Does this mean he is leaving it as it is? This Government is looking to make cuts of €2 billion yet we have valuable resources offshore which could be put to use in order take the pressure off the disabled and those with medical cards and off the State.  The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie are that for now, Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration. In the future a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised. The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field’s net profits. The report recommends that the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production. A red light warning goes on in my head when I read the figures. The report recommends that the revised tax rates should be higher than the profit resource rent tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime. The corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%. I highlight these issues because we have huge potential in our natural resources and we cannot allow the multinationals and the big oil companies to play poker with our resources and abuse people in this State and get away with murder, literally.  National colours is another way of talking about the flag that a ship has to fly for identification purposes. For Irish ships, the national colours are the national flag. There are some narrow exceptions, where the Minister outlines either an alternative or additional flag for State-owned ships, specified types of ships. A group or body can apply for a special design of flag, via an application to the Minister for a flag warrant. As stated, national colours are used as identification. As such, there are times in which the national colours must be hoisted. If not hoisted, the master of the ship commits an offence and is liable to a fine of up to €5,000. I refer to the reaction to the publication of this legislation. The Irish Sailing Association welcomed the publication of the Bill, stating that the ISA has long campaigned for a statutory register for recreational craft as required. I welcome this provision. The goal of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is to progress and update an enhanced national maritime legislative code for the Irish maritime administration. Under the current ship registration regime, ships wholly owned by an Irish citizen or an Irish corporate are obliged to register unless the ship is exempt from the requirement to register.Exemptions include ships not exceeding 15 net register tonnes burden employed solely in navigation on the rivers, canals, lakes or coasts of Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; ships acquired before the date of the passing of the 1955 Act; ships in respect of which the Minister has, under section 21 of the 1955 Act, consented to registry under the law of another country; ships owned by Irish citizens not ordinarily resident in the State; and a sea-fishing boat of less than 15 m. in length overall and required to be registered in the Register of Fishing Boats maintained under section 74 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 or which is exempt from such registration by regulations under section 76. These provisions also deal with fishing boats. I commend all those involved in the Irish fishing industry. It is important to highlight this sector because our natural resources offer great potential to develop the country. Our seas hold natural resources other than fish, notably natural gas and oil reserves, and these could be of great assistance in the current economic circumstances. We must ensure we secure the maximum gains from these assets, which are frequently forgotten, as are the people who work in the oil and gas industries. I urge the Minister to consider the points I have made and focus on the significant potential offered by ships, boats and sailing. In addition to leisure, we have a large commercial and industrial base which offers significant potential to generate additional taxation revenue. This is a sensible Bill. We must keep our eyes on the ball when dealing with broader issues related to ships, sea-fishing and sailing.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	The Bill updates the principal legislation, namely, the Mercantile Marine Act 1955. It is appropriate to revise existing law and centralise the registration of ships in the manner indicated by moving from the current diverse and scattered procedure in which some 12 different decentralised authorities are responsible for registration. It is also appropriate to commence the process of regulating the use of jet skis which can be hazardous and a nuisance and should only be used in a manner that is environmentally friendly, safe and does not interfere with the right of others to enjoy their surroundings on or near bodies of water. The registration process for ships is necessary and important. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service, in its Bill digest, sums up the position as follows:Ship registration is the process by which a ship is documented, flagged and given nationality. The nationality allows a ship to travel internationally as it is proof of ownership of the vessel.Providing for this type of information on registration is necessary given the risks that are often involved in shipping, by its very nature. The safety of crews and, in the case of passenger ships and ferries, passengers is paramount. Unfortunately, when one hears, as we frequently do, of mass tragedies in poorer and less developed countries where regulation is clearly lax and passenger ferries sink with huge loss of life, one appreciates all the more that the necessity to ensure safety is paramount. It is also necessary to have control in case ship or ferry operators take shortcuts with safety to maximise profit, thereby placing crew and passengers at risk. It is also crucial to provide for protection of the environment and ecosystems, particularly from pollutants to which shipping can give rise. Unfortunately, major oil spills occasionally occur, causing huge environmental damage to the areas of ocean affected. I am sure there are also many unreported instances of pollution, with consequent damage to the environment, wildlife, etc. For this reason, it is very important that ships and tankers carrying oil and so forth are strictly regulated. The Bill includes detailed regulations on many aspects of shipping, from rules regarding the hoisting of the national colours to the power of ship surveyors to detain a ship in certain circumstances. I am very concerned that the legislation does not make any additional provisions for those who work as employees on ships, namely, sailors and mariners, the men and women who keep international trade and passenger services going around the world. I have no doubt the Minister will argue that existing labour law includes provisions to protect such workers. The evidence shows, however, that specific measures are needed to protect workers in the shipping and fishing industries. It frequently occurs that ships pull in to a port in this country and it is subsequently revealed that workers have been highly exploited, have not been paid and are held virtually in bonded labour. Such workers are not protected by emergency action by the State. Mr. Ken Fleming, an officer of the International Transport Federation, ITF, has highlighted this issue and repeatedly sought to protect such workers. He and his federation have brought home to us the type of horrific exploitation that takes place in sections of the shipping industry. The Bill provides for the right of ship surveyors or other designated persons to detain a ship. It should also provide a right for a workers' rights officer to detain a ship in an Irish port at short notice if there is credible evidence or a suspicion of exploitation or very poor conditions for the workers on board, for the purpose of rectifying and vindicating the employment and human rights of people who find themselves in such circumstances. A serious issue arises with regard to workers on fishing boats around this island. Again, the ITF has made serious criticisms of the State in respect of negligence of the welfare of workers in the fishing industry.It alleges that there is serious exploitation of workers in sections of the fishing industry, that migrant workers here do not have legal documents to be in the State and are therefore vulnerable to exploitation and bullying which can put their lives at risk in the dangerous circumstances of the fishing industry. The ITF has recommended to the Government, for example, an amnesty to allow a space for workers who are in such difficulties to come forward to be regularised and have their rights vindicated. That would give rise to a healthier situation all round, safer working conditions and safety with regard to workers' lives. Also, nothing in the Bill addresses the pernicious European Union rules which allow shipping companies to register under flags of convenience. There is a lot in this Bill about the rules on when the national flag should be hoisted but it is silent on the abuse of workers that happens under the flags of different nation states within the Union. We had here the notorious example of Irish Ferries in 2005, where an Irish company with some blue-chip capitalists on its board changed its flag from Ireland to Cyprus in order to carry out a massive exploitation of migrant workers and get rid of hundreds of the existing workforce who were on trade union rates of pay and conditions. This was a national scandal here in 2005 but they were let get away with it. The then Fianna Fáil Minister put his hands up helplessly, stating these were European Union rules and there was nothing the Government could do about it. It was an incredible step in the race to the bottom as far as workers rights, wages, etc., were concerned. The Minister's colleagues in government - I went back over the Dáil record in preparation for this debate - were up in arms about this situation, as was the Labour Party. At the time, they were creating a huge ruckus in here in the Dáil, as I was also, demanding action from the then Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. They, and the Minister, have been in power over three years but there has been no attempt whatsoever to rectify and challenge within the European Union a situation by which EU rules can be used in order to create a regime of mass exploitation of workers plying important routes between Ireland and France or wherever, whether carrying merchandise or passengers. In my view, that should be a part of this Bill. Maidir leis an mBille Loingis Cheannaíochta (Longa a Chlárú) 2013, aontaím gur cheart go mbeadh próiseas ann chun clárú lárnach a dhéanamh maidir le longa, báid iascaigh agus a leithéid. Is ní an-tábhachtach é clárú loinge. Ceadaíonn an próiseas seo do loingeas taisteal go hidirnáisiúnta agus dearbhaíonn sé úinéireacht loinge. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh smacht ag an Stát seo ar shábháilteacht fhoireann loinge agus ar shábháilteacht na bpaisinéirí nuair is long a thógann paisinéirí atá i gceist. Tá sé tábhachtach do chaomhnú timpeallachta agus don chomhshaol go mbeadh rialacha ann maidir le sábháilteacht timpeallachta agus caomhnú na timpeallachta ó thruailliú agus a leithéid. Mar a fheiceann muid, tarlaíonnn tubaistí móra le longa anois agus arís a dhéanann truailliú uafásach ar an bhfarraige, le doirteadh ola agus a leithéid. Déanann sin an-damáiste d'éin fiáine. Baineann an-chuid den Bhille seo le rialacháin loingis agus bratacha agus mar sin de, ach níl focal ar bith le rá ann maidir le leas lucht oibre sa tionscal loingis, ar nós mairnéalaigh agus daoine ag obair mar iascairí. Cé go ndéarfaidh an tAire, b'fhéidir, go bhfuil dlithe ann cheana féin chun cearta lucht oibre a bhaint amach, is fíor go bhfuil daoine a oibríonn ins an tionscal loingis leochailleach go mór. Bíonn siad amuigh ar an bhfarraige agus go minic ní bhíonn ceardchumann acu. Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart go mbeadh rialacha nua sa Bhille seo maidir le cearta lucht oibre sa tionscal seo. Níl sin ann. Minic go leor, nuair a thagann longa go dtí an tír seo, feiceann muid go bhfuil fadhb mhór ag lucht oibre na loinge sin maidir lena gcearta agus a bpá agus feiceann muid nach bhfuil an tacaíocht chuí agus riachtanach ann dóibh. Ba cheart go ndéanfaí athrú ar sin agus go gcuirfí an chosaint sin isteach sa Bhille seo.  Rud eile, ba cheart na rialacha maidir le bratacha difriúla a athrú, mar faoi láthair is féidir le comhlachtaí dul faoi bhratach tír eile san Eoraip i dtreo agus gur féidir leo laghdú a dhéanamh ar phá agus ar choinníollacha oibre na foirne, faoi mar a dhein Irish Ferries i 2005. Ba cheart go mbeadh foráil faoi seo sa Bhille chomh maith. Labhair na páirtithe atá sa Rialtas anois amach go hard faoi seo sa bhliain 2005 agus ba scannal mór a bhí ann an bascadh a déanadh ar chearta oibrithe ag an am.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	The Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Bill 2013 is a perfect example of the reform that is needed. The Bill replaces an Act of the Oireachtas that is almost 60 years old and takes into account the changes that have occurred concerning maritime issues in that time. Charges are regularly made against the Government that it is not pursuing reform speedily enough or it is not ambitious enough. There is also an insatiable appetite for radical and sensational reforms that are often not thought through. This Bill demonstrates that meaningful effective reform takes time, thought, consideration and consultation and I note that public consultation has been carried out on this issue. The Bill contains a number of important and positive developments. It is welcome that all ships, with defined exceptions, be registered to operate in Irish territorial waters, as is the creation of a new centralised electronic Irish register of ships. Furthermore, section 24 demonstrates a welcome flexibility by putting in place a specific visitor registration for small craft scheduled to operate in Irish waters for less than three months. This provision is especially vital for marine tourism, a sector with substantial economic benefits. The focus on safety, also evident in the Bill, which is now so firmly at the core of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and championed by its Minister and Ministers of State. The provisions, such as those relating to the seaworthiness of vessels and the obligations for re-registration of vessels every ten years, mirror others, for example, relating to road safety, emanating from the same Department. Section 17 deals with the appointment of registrars of ships, with subsection (4) empowering the Minister to appoint persons to carry out those duties. I note that the current arrangements for registration are undertaken by officers of the Revenue Commissioners and that this will continue until this Bill's various provisions have been put in place. It would be interesting to know the Minister's views on this and whether registration duties or functions will be placed with an existing State agency, or if a new one will be created. The former would be more appropriate in my view. The issues of national flags, national colours and their display are addressed in sections 34 to 38, inclusive. These may seem antiquated or lacking in relevance to some, but the matter merits the focus and attention afforded to it. Aside from identifying vessels, particularly for an island nation, the use of registration for commercial benefit is also important. In the recent past, a commercial entity transferred the registration of its vessels from Ireland to other jurisdictions.

Given the various scandals that have emerged in the administration of justice, we need to challenge the political control of policing and particularly the appointment of senior police officers by a Minister and, in turn, backed by the Government. We have seen various examples of this. The former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, announced the closure of 140 Garda stations and a 10% cut in Garda numbers. In some Garda districts the cutbacks ran to a level of almost 30%, while hundreds of Garda vehicles were also cut. All of this was described as efficiency, modernisation and smart policing by the former Commissioner, to the fury of his own men and women serving on the ground right up to sergeant and inspector level. The lower and middle Garda ranks were furious about the position taken by the former Garda Commissioner. The former Minister for Justice and Equality repeatedly protected the former Garda Commissioner and senior gardaí from proper accountability and analysis of their performance. We had that unhealthy situation for far too long, so we clearly need to see the independent appointment of senior gardaí. Sinn Féin has published its own proposals on these matters. We want to see the promised new Garda authority - and I believe it will happen - appointing the Garda Commissioner along with the deputy and assistant commissioners. Last week, members of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had an opportunity to visit our opposite numbers in the North. We also met the Police Ombudsman up there and the PSNI board. The following day we went to Scotland to meet the new police authority that oversees Police Scotland. Up to recent years, the Scottish police had eight constabularies, while there is now one with a Chief Constable accountable to the Scottish Police Authority. That authority appoints senior police, while the PSNI appoints senior police in Northern Ireland. The PSNI board has 19 members, ten of which are serving politicians appointed by the d'Hondt system which is based on the strength of political parties or independents. That board recently unanimously appointed a Chief Constable, which is quite remarkable in a divided society. They have every confidence in the new Chief Constable. There is rigorous accountability and most of their business meetings are held in public session. That is the way to go and it is what we want to see. We want to support Deputy Ross's Bill as an interim measure but we need safeguards and assurances prior to the establishment of the new Garda authority. Given the scale of the crisis and the challenges we face, there is now a political consensus that we need an independent Garda authority. We trust that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will ensure that happens. The Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will soon be making unanimous recommendations on an all-party basis. I have no doubt we will recommend the type of model we would like to see. Clearly, we want to see an independent Garda authority but it remains to be decided how many people will sit on it, if it will have political representatives, and what will be the scope of its responsibilities. One of the issues that arose in Scotland concerned an inevitable tension in this new dispensation whereby the new authority was in conflict with senior police on issues including budgets and human resources. Their advice to us was to ensure the legislation is very clear on what the new Garda authority will do and what it has control over, so there is no unnecessary conflict at the start. The model we propose is for a Garda authority with 20 members from a variety of backgrounds, including legal, human rights, academic, civil society and law enforcement expertise. While we believe there should be political representation, it should be in a minority on that board and based on the d'Hondt allocation system. Our colleagues in the North have testified how well that has worked. Of course, they have disagreements but in the main they work together to ensure they can deliver a new policing model. It is an exciting time despite the crisis we have had. To borrow from the Chinese philosophy, the flip side of crisis is opportunity. We now have a real opportunity to complete the unfinished business that followed the Morris tribunal. We had the Garda Síochána Act 2005 which brought in the new Garda Ombudsman and the Garda Inspectorate. However, we now need to see a profound change in the relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the police. An independent Garda authority is required. We also need to see a change in culture throughout the organisation. The mistake we made was to bring in the oversight model but without a shadow of a doubt the Garda Ombudsman did not have the requisite powers to fulfil its responsibilities. However, we did not seek a change in the existing culture of An Garda Síochána from the person at the front desk right up to the Garda Commissioner. When she first took up her new portfolio, I heard the Minister say in a radio interview that it is a closed culture. I entirely agree with her. Police services tend to be closed cultures. They have a command structure and it tends to be an attitude of everybody being in this together. We need to find a way of maintaining that loyalty and team approach while at the same time creating a space whereby real criticism and analysis can take place. Minor complaints, such as how a Garda in a station dismissed somebody's concerns, should not have to go through the legalities of GSOC. That type of issue should be resolved by local Garda management with the Garda involved feeling comfortable in saying that he or she could have handled that better. A degree of common sense needs to be introduced. I am sure the Minister is already examining models in the North and elsewhere. We can learn an awful lot from models in the North and in Scotland. They have already been through many teething problems and challenges that we do not need to go through because we can learn from their experience.I look forward to working with the committee to put forward our recommendations. Deputy Ross has rightly tried to guarantee in legislation that an independent system will be established for the appointment of senior police officers. I am sure he will agree that when the new Garda authority comes into being, it should have the power to hire the Garda Commissioner, the deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners and, if need be, to fire them. They need to have those teeth from the outset. We support allowing this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage because we believe it is a worthwhile intervention. However, we hope it will not be necessary and that the new Garda Commissioner will be appointed through an open process managed by the Public Appointments Service and ratified by the new independent Garda authority.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	An Garda Síochána is a fundamental component in the functioning of communities and our society. Thankfully, since the foundation of the State the vast majority of our population have trusted the Garda, and gardaí in turn have protected our State and its people. In the context of discussing Garda reform, we should not forget the historic role played by the Garda and the immense work done by members of the force on a daily basis as they serve our people while at the same time helping to develop communities and a sense of togetherness. It is important that every organisation examines how best it can serve the citizen and how it can operate in an effective and successful manner. All organisations change over time, and An Garda Síochána is no different. The events that have occurred in the past number of months, including the Cooke and Guerin reports, allegations by whistleblowers and the operation of the penalty points system, have made it clear that we must examine the structure and organisation of the Garda. If public confidence in and support for the Garda is to be maintained, change is necessary. The Garda, the Government, Members of this House and the public acknowledge the need for reform. Change is needed so that the Garda can be protected and it can do its job in way that is transparent and meets the needs of society in a modern Ireland. This Bill presents us with an opportunity to begin our discussion on change and to consider what the Government has proposed. I thank Deputy Ross for introducing the Bill to the House but it deals with only one aspect of the reforms that are required without considering the need for holistic change to be implemented in the coming months. The entire policing structure of our State must work seamlessly. We cannot permit a disjointed approach. It is imperative that reform is considered in an overall context. Introducing reform in a piecemeal manner is not an option because we must ensure that change is implemented on a comprehensive basis as part of an overall package driven by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Such a package would include consideration of the establishment of an independent Garda authority, the appointment of a Garda Commissioner through open competition, the need to take whistleblowers seriously and the role of GSOC. We must also examine the way in which gardaí are recruited and promoted, and how the chain of command can be seen to operate in an open and transparent manner. This is a timely Bill which introduces matters that are necessary for us to discuss but we must take a holistic approach rather than act in a piecemeal manner.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	I thank Deputy Ross for bring this Bill before the House. However, it appears to me that it is premature and may be irrelevant because there is general agreement in this House that a Garda authority should be established. The key functions proposed for the new independent Garda authority would address all of the issues raised in this Bill. Public attitude surveys have consistently found high levels of satisfaction in the Garda among the general public but, as has been noted in submissions supporting the establishment of the Garda authority, recent events have highlighted the need to protect the credibility of the force. The importance of open and transparent oversight and accountability in achieving this aim cannot be overstated. The Northern Ireland Policing Board is regularly cited as a model that could form the basis for a Garda authority in this jurisdiction. One of the primary functions of the board is to appoint and, if necessary, dismiss the Chief Constable of the PSNI and specified senior officers. If we are to establish an authority in this jurisdiction it is reasonable to assume that the power to appoint or dismiss the Garda Commissioner and other senior gardaí should be the prerogative of the independent authority. The Labour Party has already published a paper drafted by Deputy Anne Ferris in her role as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that outlines the powers and responsibilities such an authority might possess. The proposal also recommends the establishment of an implementation committee to review current Garda structures and make early recommendations to the Minister regarding the establishment of a new Garda authority. There is consensus on the objective to be achieved but detailed elements of the reforms are subject to negotiations between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Among the key issues that will need to be addressed are the appointment of a Garda Commissioner and certain senior officers through open competition; approval of promotions of senior gardaí; and holding the Garda Commissioner to account. While the Bill before us focuses on the Garda, it also proposes to replace or amend existing structures in the public service in respect of other appointments at senior level. While all structures should be kept under review, the case has not been made that existing structures are unfit for purpose. The proposed structure could in fact lead to a more politicised system of appointments at the most senior level in public service organisations rather than allowing a candidate to be selected on merit. All of the sections of the proposed Bill are being considered in the context of legislation on an independent Garda authority. In this context, the general theme of the Bill is irrelevant because it is superseded by the Government's more comprehensive approach.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on this Bill, which allows us to address the issues that have been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on acting speedily to set a process in train to deal with a multitude of problems and introduce badly needed reform. Members on all sides of the House will agree that the process should be transparent and accountable, and help to restore confidence in our police force and the morale of gardaí on the front line. I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Ross is trying to achieve with this Bill in regard to removing political influence from the appointment of Garda Commissioner and senior officers. The question arises, however, of how we will achieve that objective. I agree with the Minister that it is an obvious task for the new Garda authority and welcome that the authority will be in place by the end of this year. These appointments should be made transparently on the basis of merit. Anecdotally, some members of the Garda believe that appointments were not made on the basis of merit. This is an opportunity to make a clean slate. The new Garda authority will be key to this reform. It should create a buffer between the Garda, on the one hand, and the Government of the day, on the other. It is also key to the restoration of confidence in the Garda, which has been affected by the many controversies that have arisen. I suggest that the authority should not only oversee senior appointments but also the entire strategy.There should be a strategy drawn up that would have to be reported on to this House, and there should be accountability on targets. There should also be an annual report on policing to the Oireachtas. Morale has been at a low ebb in recent months among the 99.9% of the Garda that is good, which is unfortunate. All these gardaí work to the highest standards and they put their lives at risk protecting law-abiding citizens in a modern society where human life is not as highly regarded as it was once. We need to start this process quickly and the announced reforms will succeed in restoring that confidence and morale in the Garda Síochána.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	The Minister dealt fairly with the issue in her response to the Bill as put before the House. I went through the Bill, which left me perplexed, and then I had to listen to Deputy Ross outline his basis for the Bill. I am very surprised that a parliamentarian with the experience and background of Deputy Ross would introduce a Bill like this now. The Bill sets out a process for appointing a Garda Commissioner that would turn into a political circus. An individual would partake in an open competition - which sounds good - with a board making recommendations before the process comes for debate here. Would this really be about the suitability of the person or would it be another case of politicising a very important position of Garda Commissioner, the top job for law and order in this country? Who in a right mind would put his or her name forward for a character assassination in here, as that is all that happens? It is a matter of opinion and somebody will have dug up an issue for everybody. Deputy Ross spoke about setting up another anonymous body, which seems accountable to nobody. At least politicians are accountable and although we are not perfect, we are a good reflection of the public at all levels of society. Deputy Ross speaks of setting up an anonymous body that is not accountable but the buck should stop with politicians rather than with another layer of bureaucracy or a committee; such bodies usually end up as a buffer for politicians to hide behind. Let us be accountable and make decisions, as that is what government is about. The Bill completely ignores the examination and reform being considered or undertaken by the Minister. Surely it should have recognised the planned new Garda authority and the imminent discussions with key stakeholders on their views of how the body should look and the best way forward for Garda reform. Why has this legislation been tabled? The issue is too easy and it relates to the Garda. It is very easy to give an impression of championing something when in reality nothing is being done. We must call a spade a spade with the politicisation of policing matters. The Cooke report has detailed what happened with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, indicating that fears it was bugged were unsubstantiated. Politicians jumped up and down without evidence, praying and crossing their fingers that GSOC was bugged by the Garda, which would lead to a field day. Politicians threw accusations and vilified the then Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner. Where is all the great evidence now? That was shocking conduct. I commend the Minister in her efforts to address these problems but there is a responsible way to do this, as opposed to grandstanding and posturing. Too much of that goes on here.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	It is undeniable that there is a deep-rooted problem within the Garda Síochána and the way in which whistleblowers within the force were treated was deplorable. The attitude shown towards people working tirelessly trying to expose the truth has been, to borrow a word from the former Garda Commissioner, disgusting. From the outset I outline my appreciation for Sergeant Maurice McCabe, former Garda John Wilson and the many other whistleblowers out there. They have demonstrated courage and a willingness to put their jobs and reputations on the line, which is something we can only hope to match. A key development will be the establishment for the first time of an independent Garda authority, which will undoubtedly be the most significant change in the oversight of the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State. I want to see the independent Garda authority as a leading light of reform within the force and I would like to see the necessary legislative proposals brought forward this year so the authority can be in place as soon as possible. One of the authority's roles should be to have an involvement in the process of appointing the most senior members of An Garda Síochána. There are comparable bodies such as the policing authorities in the North or Scotland, which have an important role in single police appointments. The next Garda Commissioner must not be a political appointment but rather the best person for the job. It is all very well setting up a Garda authority and having an inquiry but the change must come from within. In order to start the process we need a Garda Commissioner who has not yet been tainted. It is premature to make a decision now, as we must discuss the role of the Garda authority, which I hope will bring about the reforms requested by this Bill and more. I look forward to the forthcoming introduction of the independent Garda authority, and there is no doubt that the Garda structure must be reformed. Nevertheless, we must not make any hasty decisions, as we know what such decisions brought in the past. This is a deep-rooted issue which does not have a quick fix. I congratulate the new Minister and wish her well in her new portfolio. She has done a good job to date and she is very thorough. I have no doubt she has the respect of the nation.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	I thank my former Seanad colleague, Deputy Ross, for his input to the debate. He is essentially proposing a public appointments process for senior Garda officers, including the Garda Commissioner. Given that the Government is committed to the establishment of an independent authority, Deputy Ross must accept on reflection that the proposition is premature. It is likely and reasonable that a new independent Garda authority will be part of the appointments process, and there may be room for Oireachtas committee involvement. It is important that Deputy Ross accepts the reality that the Government is committed to the appointment of a Garda Commissioner by an independent body, which is a strong stance. The Garda Inspectorate is to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into a serious crime investigation and management issues arising from the Guerin report. There is also the current Toland review of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Cooke report has been published. It would be wrong of us not to say that the Cooke report totally exonerates the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and I am proud to say that. The Fennelly report is also pending, which examines the telephone calls issue.It is clear that this Government is anxious to reform and accelerate that process. No one in the Dáil could suggest a better person to do that than the Minister, who has an extraordinary record of reform in her previous ministerial role. If Deputy Ross were to reflect on this he should be happy that an independent process to appoint the Commissioner is en route and that all the other reforms are in place. It is very important, while we deal with the fall-out from the Guerin report and the matters that should be changed, to recognise that we are very well served by gardaí, that we have an excellent relationship with them, and that an impartial, highly professional and courageous Garda force polices our State. This Government has grasped all the issues and is acting on the various reports it has commissioned. The Commissioner will be appointed independently and the independent Garda authority will be set up. The Toland report on the Department is in progress. While it is a good thing that Deputy Ross has tabled this Bill, he could not on reflection do other than withdraw it, accept the reality of reform, and applaud the process that is in place.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	I welcome the debate generated by Deputy Ross’s Bill. I also congratulate Deputy Fitzgerald on her new appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality. She has a track record of reform in her time as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The Government has already commissioned the Fennelly, Guerin and Cooke reports. It has agreed to set up a commission of inquiry into the serious allegations made thus far and to establish a new independent Garda authority. The Government has stated that the new Commissioner will be appointed by way of open competition. Regardless of how the Commissioner is appointed, mistakes will be inevitable. The new Commissioner will be human. The problems of recent years arose through systems failure because of poor training, lack of facilities and lack of protocols, not how the Commissioner is appointed. I take issue with several aspects of the Bill. It purports to be concerned with the appointment of senior members of An Garda Síochána and the Garda Commissioner, but it extends its reach to all areas of the public service. That is not a problem but there must be an holistic approach to how it is done and we need to consider that seriously. The Bill creates the risk of politicising rather than de-politicising the appointment of the Commissioner by bringing it to the Dáil for a vote. That is how the public will see it. There is also the risk that very few will want to put their names forward to be humiliated in public if the Dáil does not approve the appointment. It is important to take time to consider how best to move forward. I welcome the process that will start on Friday. The public, the Garda and people who have made allegations will be well served by an authority that has everybody’s confidence. I welcome this debate but it is premature. We need time to make sure the new Garda authority is a success and has public approval.

It is true that An Garda Síochána has been subject to close scrutiny over the past few months, and rightly so. No section of society is above scrutiny but I believe that much of the discussion has been reckless and there have been attempts to paint a picture of our police service as corrupt in its totality. I reject this viewpoint and use the phrase "police service" deliberately because An Garda Síochána provides an absolutely necessary service to our society, working in an unarmed capacity to ensure the rest of us can go about our daily lives without much concern for policing matters. If we have not had direct contact with An Garda Síochána personally we certainly have heard anecdotally of the kindness, compassion and professionalism with which people have been treated by members of the service, whether at the scene of a serious crime, traffic accident or even petty thieving. Such is human nature that there are criminal elements in our society who have little or no regard for human life much less the lives of An Garda Síochána. It is important we never forget those who lost their lives in the line of duty over the years and indeed the many innocent victims of gun crime with which we are all too familiar. The majority of the members of An Garda Síochána are decent hardworking men and women, many with families. They head out to work each day not knowing who or what they will encounter in the course of their day's work. Having read the Bill and heard Deputy Ross's contribution last night, I am at a loss to understand why he believes this Bill will have any impact on the many and necessary changes needed in policing in this country. He is surely aware of the measures taken by this Government to deal with legacy issues, for example, the Guerin and Cooke reports, the establishment of the Fennelly commission of investigation, the external independent review of the workings of the Department of Justice and Equality, all of which will inform decision-making on improving the policing and justice system in this country. He claims that his Bill will place senior Garda appointments at arm's length from the political system while at the same time it proposes placing the decision on the appointment of the Garda Commissioner right at the heart of the political system, here in Dáil Éireann. How would this work in practice? If the Dáil decided not to accept the recommendation of the appointments board that he proposes, how would this affect the career of the rejected candidate? It might work against getting the best person for the job. Who would risk the possibility of such public humiliation? He seems to be claiming that the current system of senior Garda appointments is the cause of difficulties within the system. I do not see the evidence for this. The Minister has already committed to a public recruitment process to fill the Garda Commissioner vacancy and the Government has committed to the establishment of an independent Garda authority this year. I welcome the consultation process which is taking place, including the event arranged by the Minister this Friday at Farmleigh. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I participated in the recent hearings on Garda oversight. I also visited Northern Ireland and Scotland with fellow members of the committee last week, where we saw at first hand how the police authorities work in both jurisdictions. Each police service is unique and so are their oversight bodies. Their responsibilities include setting the budget for the police service, deciding on police numbers, continuous improvement of the service and the appointment of senior officers. They also ensure communities are consulted as part of their policing plan and are an integral part of it to provide for personal, professional and protective policing. We have much to consider and our report will be ready for the Minister within weeks. A fair analysis of the range of actions taken by the Government to date will reveal that it is pursuing a comprehensive programme of reform. I do not believe that Deputy Ross's Bill will add any value to the work taking place and I will not support it.

The irony cannot be lost on anybody. I was very disappointed to see Opposition Members putting that motion to a vote today given that unarmed members of An Garda Síochána have laid down their lives to protect citizens of this State. I think tonight of the men from County Limerick whose lives were ended by people whose sole motive was to subvert the institutions of the State and overthrow it. For Opposition Members to then expound on the merits of An Garda Síochána stinks of hypocrisy. An Garda Síochána has been through a very difficult patch. For an Opposition Member to bring forward such an ill-thought-out Bill when the Minister for Justice and Equality has announced there will be consultation, engagement and dialogue within the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality shows an ambition to grab a headline and scant regard for what the Bill hopes to achieve, the de-politicisation of the appointment of senior Garda officers. While people could argue there is a political element in the current appointment process, this Bill proposes a political process by throwing it open to this House to kick a person, and his or her personality and family, around. I do not know if any thought went into this Bill but nobody could stand over it and say it is what people want, given that an independent Garda authority is to be established.Our recent experiences with policing on this island should have taught us not to go down the knee-jerk road when we are making policing changes. This legislation has knee-jerk written all over it, however. The atmosphere and environment in which this ill-thought-out and rushed Bill has been introduced is not conducive to having a proper Second Stage debate. The Minister for Justice and Equality made quite a positive contribution last night. She hopes to achieve some positive things from the initiatives she has already advanced in the short period of time for which she has been in office. In fairness to the Minister, she deserves time. If this legislation is passed - neither I nor the Government will support it - it will not give the Minister the time to introduce the real reforms that are wanted by people inside and outside the House. This badly crafted Bill does exactly what it does not say on the tin, in terms of Ronseal. I do not support it. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, she needs to be given time to allow the programme of reform she has initiated to run its course and to bring a properly structured Garda authority Bill before the House. I hope the people who have put their names to this Bill will support that initiative when it is introduced by the Government.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	Deputy Ross has pointed out that 200 top posts in the Garda are decided on by the Minister for Justice and Equality. This includes the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, one deputy commissioner, eight assistant commissioners, 43 chief superintendents and 147 superintendents. The reality is that the Government acts on the advice of the Garda Commissioner when appointments are made to senior posts within the Garda. Deputy Ross is proposing that appointments at top level in various parts of the public service, including the Garda Síochána in the cases of the Garda Commissioner, the deputy commissioners and the assistant commissioners, should be made following an open competition conducted by the top level appointments committee. It is clear that the process set out in the Bill before the House has the potential to discourage suitably qualified candidates from applying, given the risk of a very public rejection. It could result in a long appointment process delaying key appointments, which is particularly inadvisable when it comes to policing in this country. It is fair to commend the Government on initiating an independent expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality. This review is to report in July. It is worth noting that amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 will be enacted to enable Garda whistleblowers to report their concerns to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. I do not doubt that the House will welcome new legislation to strengthen the powers and the remit of the ombudsman commission. I welcome the Government's announcement, which was made prior to the publication of this Bill, that it intends to select and appoint the new Garda Commissioner by way of open competition. This will give the Garda a new opportunity to move forward from the top down. The Minister has announced plans to put a new independent Garda authority in place by the end of this year. The important reforms that have been proposed provide for the complete redesign of many aspects of the running of the Garda. Deputies of all parties and none should make a significant contribution to the debate on this protected disclosures legislation when it comes before the House, especially on Committee Stage. I have no doubt that this will happen. This process will provide for the much more comprehensive reform that is required. Many Members of this House have close family connections with the Garda. In many cases, family relations were or are members of the force at all levels. While it was disappointing to learn about some of the failings that have been noted and publicised in recent months, the fact remains that the Garda from the top down has given generally great service to the people of this country for more than 90 years. However, change is needed. I commend the Minister on the speech she delivered in this Chamber last evening. She has promised to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to enable the Garda authority to be in place by the end of the year. In my view, this is the most important step to be taken before we consider the proposals set out in this premature Bill.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	The promised inquiry into the issues regarding the Garda Síochána that have been raised over the last year will be the third such inquiry in ten years. Questions need to be asked about the Morris and Smithwick inquiries, which investigated very serious allegations and identified very serious problems. Did anything change following those inquiries? The Morris tribunal found evidence of extremely serious malpractice in Donegal. The half-hearted measures provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005 achieved nothing. As I have said previously, the Morris tribunal went halfway and did not go any further. I think there were political reasons for that. The reality of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is that it dismisses 90% of complaints for all sorts of reasons. It is extremely difficult to get the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to take claims seriously. When it carries out investigations, it gets gardaí to investigate gardaí. On the rare occasions when disciplinary action against senior gardaí has been recommended, that has been ignored. Recommendations to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are usually rejected. The Smithwick report was compiled following an investigation into the serious issue of whether gardaí were involved in collusion in the murder of two RUC officers. It did not establish that this had happened, but it uncovered a culture where defending the force comes before telling the truth. This finding was dismissed out of hand by the then Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, who has since departed that role. No action was taken by the Government. The Smithwick tribunal might as well never have happened. In light of this history, we are right to be sceptical about the possibility of real and effective change taking place, despite what might be found by the promised inquiry. I would like to respond to what Deputy Mulherin had to say. We would not have come to where we are if Opposition Deputies had not grabbed these issues - the concerns of the whistleblowers and the injustices being suffered by people all over the country - and doggedly brought them to the fore. If some eggs have to be broken to ensure a proper and transparent system is put in place, everybody should support that. Such a development would be supported by every member of the Garda force. Equally, the citizens of this country are supportive of increasing transparency and bringing about real and effective change. Like everybody else in the Opposition, the Deputies in the Technical Group will watch and scrutinise every aspect of this slow process. Will the culture of defending our own - of seeing and hearing no evil - be rooted out? I refer to the culture at the top of the Garda, whereby senior gardaí regard any criticism as outrageous, find the actions of whistleblowers "disgusting" and consider the gentle probings of a toothless body like the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to be such a threat that they may have bugged its activities. Deputy Clare Daly and other Deputies have made a point about the lawful and unlawful aspects of this matter and suggested that the terms of the actual investigation need to be questioned. Change will not come about unless a decision is made to depoliticise the management of the Garda Síochána. This means taking the appointment of senior gardaí out of the hands of the Government, establishing bodies that can conduct a genuinely independent oversight of the force and giving real powers to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. I would like to conclude by referring to the serious issue of the policing of the Corrib gas protest. This is a real example of an issue of political policing - policing that is not impartial and is not based on the consent of the local community or the common good. The policing policy in this instance was based on the needs of a multinational. It was carried out in co-operation with Shell management and private security firms employed by Shell and was authorised by the State. When the Taoiseach dismissed the issues raised by Deputy Clare Daly as coming from the "usual suspects" - troublemakers from outside the area, etc. - he was adopting the very same dismissive attitude that has been exhibited with regard to the various issues that have been raised over the last year. His attitude does not fill me with any confidence that anything has been really learned or that there is any intention to address the fact that serious complaints about policing are just not taken seriously. The Taoiseach can dismiss the so-called "usual suspects" if he wants to, but I remind the House that in so doing he is dismissing Bishop Desmond Tutu, who might know a thing or two about political policing, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, who recommended after visiting Ireland in 2012 that the policing of the Corrib project should be reviewed. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which as usual dismissed most of the claims against the Corrib gardaí, found that a superintendent was in breach of discipline at Pollathomas in 2007. This was not acted on by the then Garda Commissioner. In 2008, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission sought permission from the then Minister to carry out a practice, policy and procedure review of the policing of the Corrib protest.That this request was denied tells us everything we need to know about the commission's capacity to function independently. We have heard a whole range of allegations regarding the Corrib protest, from brutality to wrongful arrests and detention, the rape tape controversy, and the allegation, which is being investigated by senior gardaí, that large quantities of alcohol were delivered to Garda stations by Shell contractor, OSSL. If the issue of the Corrib gas protests is not included in the upcoming inquiry, it raises very serious questions about the commitment to have a wide-ranging serious inquiry and take decisive action on foot of it. Everybody in this House should welcome efforts by colleagues to bring forward positive ideas and proposals on important issues. It is not good enough for people to talk about "having" to listen to somebody in this Chamber. I listened with interest to the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, last night and took note of what she said. I did so not because I had to but because I wanted to, just as I would listen to any speaker in this House. Members on both sides of the House should avoid getting on their hobby horses when discussing these issues.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. The legislation sets out to depoliticise the appointment of senior Garda officers by disconnecting that process from the political system. In preparing for this debate, I was reminded of a very well known GP in south-west Donegal who is sadly deceased. This person was a very respected doctor who helped many people in the area. He also was an avid Fianna Fáil supporter who sought election for that party at local government level on numerous occasions. I recall an interview with him on local radio some years ago in the course of which he bemoaned how Fianna Fáil had lost its way and how, at one time, a person could have relied on the local postman, council worker, Bus Éireann driver, county council official and garda all being Fianna Fáil people. That was the extent of political patronage at play in our society and which may still, to a certain extent, persist to this day. I welcome the fact that my local postman and local council workers are no longer Fianna Fáil people. By the same token, I do not wish them to be Fine Gael or Labour Party people either, or supporters of Independent representatives. I want them to have been appointed to their job because they proved at interview to be the best candidate. The type of political patronage that was so apparent in the past represented everything that was wrong with our society and within the Garda. Sadly, the only difference between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil is that the two current parties of government did not get a chance to indulge in such patronage as often as their rival did. Indeed, much of the time, Fine Gael aspired to be just as good as Fianna Fáil at what the latter did best, which was to win and hold power. This Bill sets out an independent process for the appointment of senior members of the Garda, which is welcome. Deputy Shane Ross has outlined, as he envisages it, a very simple structure which will ensure people are appointed on merit. Nobody could object to that objective. Senior Garda positions would be advertised by a board comprising three members from the Standards in Public Office Commission plus two additional members. This board would then report to the Dáil with a candidate recommendation. There is nothing to object to in that proposal. However, some Members on the other side of the House spoke positively about Deputy Ross's attempt to depoliticise the appointments process while in the same breath arguing that having the candidate approved by the Dáil is merely a different form of politicisation. I do not accept that argument. The political process that takes place under the current system is conducted behind closed doors. It is a secretive process which involves people ingratiating themselves with their political masters and their masters in the Department of Justice and Equality. It is a process of benefiting through promotions with a view to arriving ultimately at the position of Commissioner. On the other hand, if such appointments come before the Dáil, it would require politicians to stand up in public and cast their vote on whether or not the proposed candidate should get the job. If the candidate is not of the right political colour, Members might chose to vote against the appointment, but they must be ready to have their decision scrutinised. This would effectively depoliticise the process and make it open and transparent by allowing people to see why decisions are made. I was shocked when Deputy Ross mentioned some weeks ago that approximately 200 senior Garda appointments are made by way of the political process. The entire culture within the Garda is connected with politics and political patronage. This is wrong and does a disservice to the Garda, the citizens of this State and anybody who has dealings with the force for whatever purpose. The system must change. I was disappointed that the Minister made only one reference in her contribution last night to the appointment of a Garda Commissioner. She did not explain how she envisages senior appointments being made in the future under the new legislation she is bringing forward. She might offer the excuse that she is currently involved in a consultation process and does not want to pre-empt its outcome, but she should have some views and be able to express those views to the House. Even a simple statement to the effect that all senior Garda appointments will be made in an independent and impartial way would have offered an assurance that this matter will be dealt with in the legislation that is due before the end of the year to establish the new Garda authority. It would offer assurance of her commitment to doing away with the system of political patronage. Unfortunately, although the Minister outlined many of the measures she intends to take under the law reform programme she has initiated, she was silent on this point. Having noted that silence, I do nevertheless expect that she will attempt to make the necessary changes. I hope she will, in so doing, resist the kick-back that is bound to come from those interests which see the benefit in the current system, including her Department and senior gardaí themselves, and bring through the changes that are required to make the system fair, accountable and transparent. Members on this side of the House certainly will support her if we see this is actually what she is trying to achieve. I welcome the indication from the Minister that she has embarked on a consultation process on this issue, which includes an invitation to the Justice4all group to address the event in Farmleigh this Friday. It is a progressive and welcome move. The members of Justice4all must be listened to and action must be taken for the many families throughout the country that have suffered, often in already tragic circumstances, as a consequence of maladministration, malpractice and, in some cases, illegal practices within our justice system. Their demands must be heard and met. If that requires a wide-ranging commission of investigation to hear their stories and come back with recommendations, it will, although it will take time, be a very worthwhile and necessary process. It is about righting wrongs and affording the type of healing and closure to families which may help them to move on from what was done to them. Any wide-ranging reform of the Garda should address the situation whereby our police force is also our security service. The Garda is supposed to be a democratically accountable policing service for the citizens of the State, but it is also operating in security circles. It is another element of that culture which is about closing ranks and not allowing certain things to emerge in case of exposure as to what is being done, who is being monitored and so on.We could have a security service attached to the Army, which already has a security service, or we could have an independent security service, if that is so vitally important. However, it needs to be separated from the Garda which would go a long way towards ensuring the Garda could be more accountable. Ridiculous things are put down to State security, such as how much it costs to run the Commissioner's office each year. We cannot be given that information because it is a State security issue. That is just nonsensical. The Commissioner's office should be accountable and the cost of running it should be known by everyone. However, while we have a State security apparatus tied in with the Garda, this will allow the culture that has prevailed in the Garda to continue. The Minister has much work to do and this Bill could contribute to the process. If the Minister would indicate that all the appointments mentioned in this Bill would be made as part of an open and transparent process under the new Garda authority, it may go some way towards satisfying the requirement for this Bill. We need to end the culture of political patronage wherever it takes place, whether in the Garda, the councils, An Post or in State services.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. In principle, I absolutely believe we need to separate politics from the appointment of the Garda Commissioner. I think a Member on the Government side outlined the fact there were 200 appointments, of which I was aware, but he said that of those 200, one pretty much takes the Garda Commissioner's list. That is all the more reason that separation should happen at that level. It should be a force or a service with people ending up in senior positions based on merit. I was a little bit surprised by the tone of the contributions and by the similarity of some of them, which was striking. It almost seemed as if a press office document was issued and they were working from it. That is a pity because even if we disagree on what is in legislation, the spirit of debate should be better than that. One of the things we were told to avoid was group-think. There is no doubt that Ireland has one of the most powerful Executive's in the democratic world when one examines the balance of power between the Parliament and the Executive, and that plays a part in this particular issue. Since our Constitution was decided on by the citizens, the Executive has had that grip which has tightened, if anything. This is one of the most heavily whipped Parliaments in the developed world. There is a core of 15 Ministers who wield extraordinary power and very often the feeling is that most of what happens in the Parliament is merely a rubber-stamping exercise, especially as the Government has such a large majority. Ministers of State have influence rather than power. We must have proper checks and balances. The Executive has become the property of political parties and in public life those who display loyalty to a particular party get a reward. It does not have to be like that but that forms a part of this. I would like to see very significant Oireachtas reform where there is a break between the Executive and the Parliament. That is needed as part of what is suggested in this Bill, otherwise that rubber-stamping and majoritarianism will continue. The culture here must change. It must also change in the context of how the Garda Commissioner is to be appointed.  The appointment of senior gardaí is an area that needs to be re-examined. The link between Government and Garda Commissioner has been exposed as being fundamentally unhealthy. It was just unhealthy for the Garda Commissioner but it was also unhealthy for politics and for the Minister. The kind of information given to the Commissioner that was misused by the Minister on the airwaves demonstrated that. In regard to reform, I was very interested in one of the papers given to the Constitutional Convention in regard to the reform of Westminster. A committee, for example, would have a function in scrutinising the Deputy Commissioner. However, we know the way our committees are formed. What was done in Westminster seemed to change the culture of the way its committee system worked. It seems to function quite well and it has been established since the late 1970s. They are genuinely committees of the Parliament and the chair is selected by secret ballot in each instance, which seems to give the chairs of those committees enhanced power by virtue of the fact it has changed the culture. There was a value in that for both the Government and opposition. That cultural shift is important and is needed before the change proposed here would be really effective.  The Guerin report stated that discipline was important. Discipline was not defined as just loyalty to the senior ranks in a very hierarchical organisation but was discipline in regard to the work at hand. Something fairly serious in my area, which I have been raising for some time, is the way gardaí are deployed. They are deployed in a very unfair way and there is no rationale as to the numbers in a given area. There are comparable areas where there are huge differences. How can we have that discipline if we cannot even make that change? It suited Governments, not necessarily this Government, that there were not big shifts in personnel because it might cause a problem for a particular constituency. That is part of the reason gardaí are deployed the way they are. That is an issue which needs to be addressed because it is one of discipline in the fullest meaning of the word. I am very open-minded about the changes which will take place and I am certainly listening to what the Minister is saying. She is coming at this with a fresh pair of eyes.What disappointed me following the election was that in spite of what was talked about in terms of the radical change that was going to happen, we only got fairly superficial change. I urge the Minister to go the whole hog with some of the initiatives she intends to take and not to row back and accept something that is less than the ideal. I support the principle of separating the roles, changing who appoints the Garda Commissioner and ensuring promotion is based on merit. I see no reason for the Bill not to be included in the mix of changes that will eventually deliver a better service and restore confidence in a service that requires a cultural shift. That could be helped by changing the culture at the top, because without doing so, people in the lower ranks will not have a chance to excel and to make the kind of changes within the force that it deserves and the citizens of the country deserve.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	I welcome the debate that has taken place in this House, to which I have listened, on the Public Sector Management (Appointment of Senior Members of the Garda Síochána) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Ross. It will come as no surprise to the Deputy to hear the Government is opposing the Bill.
As the House is aware, a comprehensive reform programme is being put in place that will restore public confidence in the work of the Garda Síochána and fully support the men and women of the police force who contribute daily to preserving law and order and protecting the security of the State. In the debate last night several Members quite rightly acknowledged the important contribution made by the Garda Síochána to society. Members also acknowledged the need for change. The Government has responded to the issues raised in the various recent reports by initiating a comprehensive programme of reform which includes the establishment of an independent Garda authority. That will change both culture and attitude. There will be an opportunity to discuss the issue with other stakeholders at the consultation event the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has convened in Farmleigh on Friday. The event promises some interesting discussions on reform of the justice system. Those are important matters and not lightly decided. In that context and as a priority, work is under way in the Department of Justice and Equality on drafting the legislation for the new independent police authority. Part of the debate will be around the issue of the selection and appointment of candidates to senior Garda positions. The Bill proposed by Deputy Ross deals with the single issue of setting up structures which are mainly intended for appointments to senior positions in the Garda Síochána. His stand-alone proposal does not take account of the wider reform agenda that is under way. In particular, it ignores the setting up of the proposed independent Garda authority and its potential role in the process of appointing the most senior members of the Garda Síochána. In fact, the Bill, if enacted, would take away any opportunity for the authority to assume such a role in the short term. It is vitally important that individual reforms, such as the way in which senior officers are appointed, are designed to fit properly with other elements of the comprehensive reform programme and not brought forward in a piecemeal manner. In addition to not taking account of the planned establishment of a new Garda authority, Deputy Ross seeks to pre-empt the outcome of extensive consultations under way, including but not limited to the extensive hearings and study trips being undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, and the planned stakeholder consultation event, to which I alluded, that will take place this Friday in Farmleigh. The Bill also puts the Dáil centre stage in relation to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner. It introduces a lengthy process for the appointment and, in fact, politicises the process. The Bill also has the potential to deter suitable candidates. The Government has indicated that an open competition will be held for the next appointment to the post of Garda Commissioner. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, informed me that preparations will begin in July with the intention of making an appointment before the year end. I wish to restate the Government's opposition to the Bill. It is untimely and inappropriate in the context of legislation which the Department of Justice and Equality is bringing forward as a matter of urgency to establish a new independent Garda authority. The Bill tries to pre-empt decisions on the important job of making appointments to senior positions in the Garda Síochána and therefore cannot be supported by the Government. The Government will not support a proposal which is premature and being put forward in isolation to other vital reforms. I have listened to many of the contributions both tonight and last night, and the one thing that strikes me about all of them is that we are all determined that the politicisation of the Garda is brought to an end and that we have an independent Garda authority that ensures better management, as Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly said, of both the personnel and the skills available. The Garda authority is the place for that to happen. I do not accuse Deputy Ross of anything other than wishing to be helpful but his Bill on its own as a single entity will not give us the type of reform we all seek. We should wait and ensure the reform of the Garda Síochána is comprehensive, as Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly said, is far reaching and is the best that we can have.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	I commend Deputy Ross on introducing the Bill. I and others find it pitiful that it has taken a member of the Opposition to do so while the Government continues to stick its head in the sand on this issue. That is my estimation from listening to some of tonight’s contributions.
In recent weeks, the world's media has looked on in disbelief as the scandal of the mother and baby homes was allowed to go uncommented on and unchecked by the Government of the day. I have no doubt future generations will gape at the complete and ongoing lack of transparency in the justice system throughout a series of scandals that one would expect to find in South America or the Middle East. The most recent accusations which have come into the public domain concerning the practices of senior, Government-appointed members of An Garda Síochána, such as the whistleblower controversy and the alleged bugging of the office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, have all demonstrated the unhealthy relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner. At the very least, this relationship cannot be deemed best practice. At worst, it is a situation one might see in a banana republic: a system wide open to cronyism and corruption. Contrary to what the Minister said, the reforms proposed in the Bill are long overdue. Many of us were shocked to hear that the top 200 positions in the Garda Síochána are filled by political or Government appointment, a practice which is open to enormous abuse. The Garda Representative Association itself has been highly critical of the practice. I am loth to imagine the number of highly skilled gardaí who have been passed over for promotion in the past because they did not have the right political or social connections. The effect of that on Garda morale must be truly gutting. The Garda Representative Association has made representations to Government for a police authority since 1979, to no avail. Surely rank and file gardaí, those at the coalface of the justice system, are better placed than any politician to point out where accountability is most needed. Whether nepotism and political interference are at play, the suspicion always exists and that has a detrimental effect on the good name of the force as a whole. A recent Millward Brown poll reflected the huge dent which policing scandals have made in the reputation of An Garda Síochána, with 57% of people saying their confidence in the Garda has been damaged as a result. The poll found that seven in ten people believe responsibility for all senior appointments and promotions in the force, including that of Commissioner, should be removed from the Department of Justice and Equality.An overwhelming 87% believe garda management should be independent of politics. Morale in the force is at an all-time low. The reforms proposed in this Bill, based on the co-principles of open competition and independence, would go a long way towards improving this. Structures, training and forms of accountability all need to be redesigned from scratch with the Garda body stripped of prejudice and its members there to defend hard-won democratic freedoms. Denis Bradley, a former vice-chairman of the Northern Ireland policing board, stated:In most modern societies and democracies something was always placed between the justice Department and the police service to ensure a certain distance and involve as much of society as possible. What we mainly end up is some form of policing authority which is made up of people from different political parties, plus independently minded people, so one has a greater roundness and oversight is not placed in the hands of any one Minister or any one political party. I am disappointed the Minister said this Bill will interfere with the Government’s proposed legislation in this area. This Bill is specific to the views of 87% of people consistently polled on Garda appointments. I have shown this legislation to several gardaí who found nothing wrong with it. It is disappointing the Government will reject this Bill entirely tonight.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	I thank all Members who contributed to Second Stage of this Bill, particularly my colleagues on these benches. I thank the Sinn Féin Members for their support in principle for this Bill. They wish that it would proceed to Committee Stage and, like every other Member, that there would be an independent Garda authority with teeth and credibility which would guide the future of the Garda Síochána not just in its operations, but its appointments. That is my wish too - certainly, partially. My problem, however, is that I am not sure that any independent authority in this State is ever independent. I have never trusted any Government that I have known not to stuff so-called independent bodies with its own nominees who then control appointments to, and the operation of, these vital bodies. I have listed them over the years. For example, the Central Bank, a highly sensitive body, has had on its board political nominees whose loyalty is to a political party, not to the State. NAMA, the National Asset Management Agency, another sensitive body, is stuffed from time to time - I accept not all the time - with people who have identifiable political affiliations. There are the examples of a body as sensitive as the Garda Síochána and the courts of this land where every single appointment is political and where people of both the major parties, and of the Labour Party, have behaved with absolutely shameless powers of patronage. I agree we need to form an independent Garda authority. However, the main political parties will degrade, dilute and discredit the system of appointments established for other so-called independent bodies. I do not doubt for one moment the integrity or the intentions of the Minister for Justice and Equality in this matter. I know her to be a person of immense ability, dedication and honesty. The record of others in her party and her coalition partners, however, is shameless. We cannot give her a blank cheque with the so-called independent Garda authority because of the record of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour on this issue. We cannot be too starry-eyed about it, saying there is a Holy Grail there and everything will be all right. The record of the main political parties does not justify the sort of optimism about an independent Garda authority which I have heard here this evening from Members opposite. Having said that, I thank the Minister for her reply. It was constructive and I understand her intentions. While I do not agree with her, there are many in the Fine Gael and Labour parties who genuinely wish to see a solution to this appalling problem which has burst out like a boil in recent times. It is wrong to say this Bill is premature. In fact, it is 90 years too late. While it was not drafted in a hurry, I am in a hurry. We should be in a hurry because what has happened in the past few months is a shame on all of us and a terrible reflection on what has happened in the Garda, the Department of Justice and Equality and elsewhere in politics, as well as the relationship between them. Neither is it good enough to claim we are going to have an open competition for the post of Garda Commissioner. The former Commissioner resigned nearly three months ago. What the hell has been going on since? This morning, I received an e-mail from the Department - belatedly because they knew I needed it last night - which stated:I refer to your e-mail requesting the information on the process being followed to select the new Garda Commissioner. The Government has announced there will be an open competition for the appointment of the post of Garda Commissioner. It is intended that preparations for the competition will begin in July with the appointment being made towards the end of the year.There is no sense of urgency there at all and neither is there any information about how this is going to be done. I cannot see why a new Garda Commissioner, a key office of this State, has not been appointed yet or the process of selecting one has not even started. There is no good reason for the delays in the reforms in question. I understand the Minister’s need to move carefully because she is new in the office. I understand the horrific mess she has inherited. I do not trust, however, the kind of litany of reviews, commissions, investigations, comprehensive programmes and consultations that she is planning. Are we really to believe that there is no one who can put a good process in place and accept a Bill like this which will at least allow us to select a new Garda Commissioner on an independent basis? This Bill could dovetail with a new independent Garda authority, if necessary. The knee-jerk reaction to reject it is unfortunate. The Minister could have said, as Sinn Féin did, “Yes, there are good provisions in this Bill which we will accept as it may fit into the process which we planned, which is vague, or it may not”. I reject the absurd criticisms that this is politicising the process. That is a cheap and nonsensical response. What has been happening for many years, as Deputy Pringle said, has been a secretive, behind-closed-doors, non-independent process.To state the introduction of a new system whereby the Top Level Appointments Committee would conduct interviews to select three people to be sent to the public appointments board which would then select one of these candidates to go before the Dáil would politicise the process is absolute and obvious nonsense. The final candidate would be brought to the House so Members of this House and perhaps the other House could ask questions so the public could see the person selected is worthy and the process is transparent. As Deputy Pringle stated, it would quite rightly allow Members to pin their colours to the mast. There would be no more secretive behind closed doors Ministers selecting pals who select other pals to do other things. If it were done here it would be done before the people, and the people would see what is happening and could give a verdict on whether the process was worthy or not. It could then go to a Dáil committee. I see nothing wrong with this democratic and transparent process. It is absurd for Deputy Mulherin to state this would be a character assassination. This would not happen. People would be pushed to answer questions in public, which is absolutely right with regard to people who have key appointments of this type. I am sorry Deputy Niall Collins is not here. We have seen only one member of Fianna Fáil arrive in the Chamber in the past two minutes, so I do not wish to thank Fianna Fáil for its contribution to the Bill because it has not contributed much.

The least he can do for the House is read the Bill. He could also send in one of his cohorts to Bills of this type because he is the spokesperson on justice.
