#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	In light of An Post outlining a rationalisation programme in recent days, will the Minister, Deputy Naughten, update us on concerns that exist in rural communities where there is now a real prospect that post offices will close?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	As Minister, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post. I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and am concerned to ensure the needs of those communities continue to be met. As part of the strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail. Last week An Post announced its plans for a modernised post office network.  The vision centres around the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. Such services will include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. The announcement by An Post is supported by an agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, executive following three months of intensive negotiations under the guidance of Mr. Turlough O’Donnell SC. While I am conscious that final acceptance of the agreement is still subject to a ballot of IPU members, the announcement represents a positive first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas. Operational matters relating to the company’s retail business, including the post office network, are matters for the board and management of An Post. I understand An Post has not made any definite decision on post office closures but there is no doubt that the move to electronic transactions has affected the post office network. Changes to the footprint of the post offices network, where they occur in the longer term, will be a consequence of the modernisation process as opposed to an objective of the modernisation process. That means over the next four years, some post offices may close, but that is solely a matter for An Post and the postmasters to work out through a defined process. The fact that there will be no compulsory closures of post offices is a highly significant outcome of the negotiations. The deal will see An Post invest €50 million in growing and modernising the network and includes agreement on a protocol which I specifically sought to help manage the modernisation of the network in a transparent and community focussed manner. IPU members will be balloted on the proposals later this month. I am also pleased to advise that Government funding of €80,000 has been secured, through the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, for the roll-out of a pilot digital assist scheme. Ten post offices will be equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions. The ten pilot schemes will be located in rural post offices and will be in place later this year. Given the challenges it is facing, the company will have to pursue an ambitious agenda across its various business areas and there is likely to be significant change and new business models implemented in the coming years. This should be viewed positively as it will result in a solid, sustainable business future. While financial and structural challenges remain, achieving a common view of the steps to be taken to regenerate the network is of great significance as the company rebuilds and takes action to secure the future of the company and the network. The agreement is a significant milestone and shows that An Post, the IPU and postmasters have the potential to work together to deliver a viable and sustainable future for the post office network to the benefit of all parties and the public.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	The Minister may be aware that An Post over the last two days has offered, I believe, some 400 postmasters the voluntary opportunity to terminate their contracts for a severance package. That may well meet the needs of many of the postmasters concerned. However, I am sure it will not meet the needs of the communities that will be left without a post office. In his response, the Minister put a lot of stock on what the postmasters think and what An Post thinks. What about the communities that are losing a service? I can understand why An Post is taking this approach. The board of An Post has to look to profit and loss and to viability. The Minister spoke of viability in his response, but what about the viability of the communities that will be left without perhaps the only service they have had for some time? Garda stations have closed and small schools have closed. I refer to the only facility with the harp over the door and that gives some inclination that the Government still cares about those villages. I want the Minister to put a plan in place to ensure those communities are not left without a service. It will require an input from Government. I refer to a public service obligation to ensure the services of a post office are available, even though in some of those communities we all have to accept that the services may not be viable on a profit and loss basis. However, if the service is not left there to facilitate the communities that still exist, then that community will cease to exist in a short time. In addition to the work An Post is doing, there is work to be done by the Government to identify what Government services can and should be delivered. We have heard a lot of talk about that for a long time with little action. We need Government investment to sustain a service that may not be viable otherwise.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	They are two key aspects of this issue on which I have been highly focused. That is why, as part of the overall process, an agreed protocol has been put in place. Just to give an example, we could have a situation where there are two post offices within 700 m of each other. There is a broad range of situations here. It is not just about isolated rural communities. We have to try to develop a modern, robust network. Under the protocol that has been agreed between the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post, if a postmaster does not want to continue to provide a service it would be offered to another business within the same community or the business would be transferred to the next nearest post office. As I said, in some instances the next nearest post office may only be 700 m down the road. The Deputy is correct in saying that we need to do more on the transfer of Government services into the post office network. As Deputy Dooley knows, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, made an announcement last week with regard to social welfare services. I have publicly advocated in the past and made a submission to the post office network business development group chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr to the effect that we should be diverting more Government services, particularly off-line services, through the post office network.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I accept that but there has been a lot of talk on that from Government, particularly from the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and others. In fact, the Minister and Deputy Ring had a dispute when they were senior and junior Ministers as to who had responsibility in this regard, the net result of which is that we are no further on. The Minister made reference to 700 m but the reality is that the document refers to 15 km. It refers to a commitment that there will be a post office within 15 km for 95% of the rural population. The notion of having to travel up to 15 km to avail of a post office service is hugely problematic in many rural areas. That is beyond the reach of a vast amount of people who live in rural Ireland. Incidentally, there is no big concession here as that is what is required of An Post, as I understand it, under its contract with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. It is not as if something major has been given here. In reality, 15 km is far too far to expect people in rural areas to travel. I appeal to the Minister to work with An Post over the coming months to fill the gap the company cannot fill. The State must provide an appropriate level of subvention under a public service obligation, PSO, to meet the needs of rural communities. Nothing less than that will ensure that those communities have the capacity to thrive and be sustained into the future.

The first practical step that the Government is taking is the digital assist pilot programme. Under that programme, post offices will provide access to a wide range of Government services. We have picked out ten locations for the pilot programme across the country at Austin Friar Street in Mullingar, Ballaghaderreen, Bandon, Buncrana, Claremorris, Dingle, Loughboy in Kilkenny, Oranmore in Galway, Portarlington in Laois and Tramore. The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty and I are actively engaged in this to ascertain how we can bring more Government services into the local post office network. We are determined to ensure that is happening.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	We are going to start sticking to the clock, as is my usual way of doing things. Questions Nos. 19 and 20 are grouped together. I call Deputy Stanley to introduce his question.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I will not be expecting any more latitude than that given to the previous speaker. The Minister's Department interacts with a lot of powerful and profitable commercial interests in the energy sector, including oil, gas and electricity companies, as well as in the media. There is a public service obligation, PSO, levy, for example, of €500 million to the renewable energy sector, while the national broadband plan will see the Department spending in excess of €500 million. In that context, what measures are in place to ensure transparency and fairness?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together. Deputy Stanley should not forget that my Department also deals with a lot of environmental NGOs. My Department is responsible for a number of areas critical to economic and social development such as energy, climate action, cyber and environment which are complex and cross-cutting areas. As Minister, I am required to make significant and sensitive decisions to support the effective operation of the sectors for which I am responsible. It is not possible to make correct decisions without understanding their impact on those operating in those sectors. Therefore, of necessity, it is important to meet and engage with the sectoral stakeholders, including industry, to get a better understanding of the environment in which they operate if I am to make informed decisions in areas that underpin economic and social development.   In recognition of my ministerial position, I and my officials are subject to a number of statutory requirements including requirements under lobbying and ethics legislation. The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, an independent body, is the registrar of lobbying. The Act is designed to provide information to the public about who is lobbying whom about what. It provides for establishing and maintaining a register of persons who carry on lobbying activities and for a code of conduct relating to carrying out lobbying activities. The registrar has pointed out that lobbying is an essential part of the democratic process which enables or facilitates citizens and organisations to make their views on public policy and public services known to politicians and public servants. SIPO has established an easily searchable and free to use online register of lobbying at www.lobbying.ie. Public bodies have specific responsibilities under the Act. Section 6(1) of the Act provides that the following persons shall be regarded as designated public officials or “the lobbied” for the purposes of the Act, namely, Ministers and Ministers of State, Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, Members of the European Parliament for constituencies in the State, members of local authorities, special advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997, public servants of a prescribed description and any other prescribed office holders or description of persons. Section 6(4) of the Act requires each public body to publish a list showing the name, grade and brief details of the role and responsibilities of each “designated public official” of the body. The list must be kept up to date. The purpose of the list is to allow members of the public to identify those persons who are designated public officials and to serve as a resource for lobbyists filing a return to the register who may need to source a designated public official’s details. In accordance with the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, my Department publishes a list of designated public officials which includes myself, as Minister, the Minister of State assigned to my Department, currently Deputy Kyne, and my special advisers. It also includes the Secretary General of the Department, the five assistant secretaries and the Department’s head of technical section, petroleum affairs. In addition, the Department makes available the Act itself by linking to the Standards in Public Office Commission's www.lobbying.ie website, containing all relevant information regarding the Act, requirements for public bodies, list of public bodies, designated public officials and the transparency code. My Department's information on lobbying and its list of designated public officials is accessible on the part of the Department's website dealing with compliance.   Section 5(7) of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform shall prepare and publish a code, to be known as the "transparency code", which sets out how certain relevant public bodies, such as ministerial advisory groups, may conduct their activities in a transparent way. By adhering to the transparency code, communications within these bodies would meet the exemption from the requirement to register and report on lobbying activities. This would be actively used within my Department in relation to many groups. Finally, while I am satisfied that I and my Department adhere to all the statutory requirements on lobbying, I have discussed the issue with my Secretary General and he will review the situation and consider whether any changes need to be made to the procedures in my Department to bring further clarity to this area.  
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I thank the Minister for his reply. He mentioned NGOs but I think he will appreciate there is a world of difference between, for example, the Stop Climate Chaos group, which is a non-profit voluntary group, and the likes of Independent News and Media, INM, Enet and other commercial companies. SIPO has published a code of conduct for public office holders. Under the heading, "Principles of Ethical Conduct", it states that holders of public office "have a duty to keep faith with the public trust placed in them" and it continues in that vein.Section 1(5) states that in relation to the highest ethical standards, "office holders should at all times observe the highest [possible] standards of behaviour and act in good faith with transparency, fairness and impartiality to promote the common good". It further states they should "not be influenced in their official duties by personal considerations". The Minister is correct about the lobbyists. Contact between officeholders and lobbyists is to be expected but it should not give rise to a conflict with public duty or private interests. The issue here is that it is unofficial and official contact. Regarding records of meetings and contacts, in all cases where meetings are arranged for the purpose of the transaction of official business, the Minister should be accompanied by an official who would act as a note-taker. Considering the large amount of commercial interests involved in the Minister's Department, does he and his officials adhere to all these provisions? Are there two types of meetings with his Department and two types of contacts, both official and unofficial? How many of those occur?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	We do comply with all the standards and the legislation as set out. As I said, I have discussed this with my Secretary General and he is reviewing the position to consider if any further changes are necessary. I can tell the Deputy that I will not be taking any phone calls from lobbyists in the future. The reality is that we do comply with it. If the Deputy looks at the register he will see there are 951 occasions on which my name is mentioned in regard to various interest groups that have lobbied me since I was appointed Minister. On average, that is approximately 50 per month covering a wide range of areas from the environmental sector through to communications, energy, broadcasting, media and across the spectrum. It is a very busy, complex Department. Many aspects of it are very technical and, as I said, I have discussed this with my Secretary General.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I thank the Minister. Can we try to bring this matter to a conclusion rather than have it drag on, which does not suit any of us? We all have a responsibility to this House to try to get it tidied up. There are a couple of straight questions the Minister needs to answer. First, will he accept that he provided confidential information, in other words, an insight into what his future intentions might be? Let us not dance on the head of a pin on that. Will he accept that three weeks later he came in here and misled the Dáil, albeit, I suspect, inadvertently? There is potential for all of us to do it. It is just a matter of addressing it and getting beyond it. Will he accept that his actions amounted to wrongdoing? I do not bear the Minister any ill-will whatsoever. I have considerable sympathy for him in this instance in terms of the way he wandered into such a fire-storm. Nonetheless, he is responsible to the House so there are three things the Minister needs to do. First, he needs to accept that confidential information was given because it gave an insight into where the might ultimately go; he can put a caveat on it. The second issue is about misleading the Dáil, and the third is accepting that there was wrong done. It does not require the Minister to resign. Nobody has been demanding that, but it requires him to be answerable to the House. This issue will then come off his desk and those of everybody else.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	No. I did not give confidential information, and I am categorical about that. I sincerely regret that conversation and acknowledge that it was a political mistake to have had it. I have learned from my experience and I sincerely apologise for that, but I did not give confidential information because I did not have any information available to me at that stage. The information I had was the information that everyone else in this House had or was available on Google. I regret giving my opinion in regard to it at that point. The reality was that three weeks later when I was here in the House I had an active file in front of me and it was a very different situation at that point. I have been at pains to try to point that out and I do sincerely regret it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	On the Minister's reply, the problem is that I asked him about this in October 2016. I asked him a priority question here in the House on 6 December 2016 on his intentions regarding that merger and what he intended to do and he told me, and the Official Report of that debate is available, that he had absolutely no idea. I think he even shook his head in terms of what he intended to do about it. The Minister can say he did not have the file in front of him at that point and that he had not entered into the process. I know how that works. I have looked at all of that in detail and I was following it very carefully at the time because we had huge concerns about it, and I had been raising it with the Minister for months before that. That is where the problem arises. I accept that the Minister has apologised. What we must do now is make sure that we tighten up this entire area. The chairman of the company in question is also the chief executive officer, CEO, of a solar development company. I refer also to Bord Gáis Energy. He also sits on the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I am not suggesting any impropriety on the part of any member of that company but I am saying that there is a very small circle. Dublin is a big city but it is a small town, so to speak, in that there are many people who have contacts. The Minister has told us his Secretary General will look at this issue. What particular steps does the Minister have in mind to tighten up this area? Will he agree that unofficial contacts with Ministers by lobbyists has to stop?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	In my initial reply to Deputy Stanley's supplementary question I said I will not be taking calls from lobbyists. I have said to him that I have discussed the issue with my Secretary General and he will be reviewing the position to see if any other changes in procedures are necessary, but procedures are set out clearly in this regard. I have apologised for it. I sincerely regret it. I just want to move on and focus on the work in front of me, which is a very demanding job and a very demanding Department. I know that all Deputies present want to do the same. There is nothing more that I can say on this issue.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I want to let the Minister get on with his job. I want to get on with mine but I am still at a loss to understand why he regrets taking the call, why he has apologised for taking the call and why he has asserted that he will never take a call again if he did nothing wrong in the first instance. The facts remain that the Minister failed to understand that by providing an insight, a hunch or a personal opinion on his thinking, whatever it might be, that was confidential information. It is the confidence of the Minister's own personal information that is at play here, not access to some information in regard to his officials. The Minister had a hunch as to where this process was going and he gave that information to the lobbyist who passed it on. That is now forming part of evidence the Director of Corporate Enforcement is using as part of his campaign to appoint investigators. It was confidential information. That is what the Minister needs to accept. That is what he has identified as being regrettable in terms of taking the call. That is what he apologised for and he needs to start at the beginning and accept that he provided confidential information and that it was wrong. It is on a relatively low scale and it can be addressed in this House. Will he, please, bring this matter to a conclusion?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	First, I did not give any confidential information. Second, I made it crystal clear that I would be guided by whatever advice I got from my officials, and the file shows clearly that is exactly what I did. The reason for my apology is because this is the fourth day in a row this House has been discussing the issue of a 30-second conversation I had in which I gave an opinion that I sincerely regret giving. That is why I am apologising to this House and to the public. The House has been preoccupied with this issue for four days in a row.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I ask the Minister when the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will begin its review into the ownership and control policy of media companies and if he intends to make a submission to that review.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is the contractor for broadcasting licences for both television and radio stations in Ireland. In the context of that role and its obligation under the same Act to promote diversity and plurality in broadcasting services and the wider media landscape, the authority operates an ownership and control policy. This policy sets out how the authority will consider applications for broadcasting licences and variations to existing licence conditions in light of its obligations. The authority is independent in the issuing of broadcasting licences and I, as Minister, have no function in this matter or in respect of the development, operation or review of the authority's ownership and control policy. I am aware that the authority has announced its intention to review this policy and that it has commenced a targeted consultation with relevant stakeholders. Dublin City University has been engaged by the authority to co-ordinate the consultation, in which my Department will participate. The authority has indicated that this consultation will be completed by mid-July. Following this, the authority is expected to consider if any revisions to the current policy are warranted. If revisions are considered necessary, the authority intends that a revised draft policy will be the subject of a public consultation later in the year. The authority has also commenced the drafting of a new plurality policy, which will be the subject of a targeted and public consultation later this year. Both the authority's ownership and control policy and its proposed plurality policy are separate to the authority's role in the media mergers regime, as provided for in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  In this respect, it is worth pointing out that the authority will be producing the second ownership and control report for the period 2015 to 2017 later this year. This report describes the ownership and control arrangements for undertakings carrying on a media business in the State, outlines the changes to the ownership and control arrangement over the previous three years and analyses the effects of such changes on the plurality of the media in the State.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	Does the Minister feel that changes are needed? On his watch, Reporters Without Borders has said that, in terms of press freedom, Ireland has slipped from ninth to 14th in the world. Last year, an EU report raised concerns about press freedom in Ireland. It said that there was a high risk as a result of the concentration of media ownership. The Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 was put in place but despite its existence, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission gave the green light for the Independent News and Media acquisition of Celtic Media. The Department saw fit to refer that matter to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which raises questions about whether the legislation is fit for purpose. Does it need to be strengthened? What is the Minister's position and what is that of his Department on the issue?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I will deal with the Deputy's final question first. On foot of the Celtic Media-Independent News and Media phase 2 assessment, I asked my officials to review the process to see if there were weaknesses in it and if it could be streamlined to operate in a better way. One of the criticisms of it and potentially other ones that would come forward is the time lag involved in turning around the reports. I am waiting for that from my officials. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has two functions. One is the ownership and control policy, which is different from the ownership and control report. Under the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has two specific roles in media mergers. One is in the phase 2 assessment, which has been discussed at length over the past four days. The authority's second role is that it must prepare a report that describes the ownership and control arrangements of undertakings carrying on media business in the State. The first report was published on my Department's website and the second is in the process of being compiled.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	The Minister is as aware as I that there are serious concerns about media ownership and control in this country. There is the huge role Independent News and Media plays within the Irish media scene. One individual, a billionaire, has a near 30% stake in that company. The information coming out in the courts has raised serious questions. The Independent News and Media servers were handed over to Trusted Data Solutions for what is known in the trade as interrogation. The Independent News and Media board did not seem to know about it. The bill seems to have been paid by a company called Blaydon, which, according to the Paradise Papers, is a Denis O'Brien company. Those servers would have sensitive data, important issues regarding journalistic sources-----
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I caution the Deputy about being mindful-----
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	Yes. The company would have had sensitive data about journalistic sources and yet it seems to be used as a plaything by a billionaire media mogul. This has given rise to serious concerns. Does the Minister have anything to say on the matter?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	They are very serious allegations. The Data Protection Commissioner, Helen Dixon, is looking into these matters and I have every confidence in her carrying out her inquiry into very serious allegations. There are two processes. One is about to commence and the other, which relates to ownership and control policy, is ongoing. It has implications, as has the ownership and control report. Let us see what will emerge from both.

What is the current level of proposed solar array power generation? How does the Minister see it fitting into the renewable energy strategy? He announced photovoltaic, PV, grants for households in respect of solar microgeneration on rooftops and so on a couple of months ago. What are the targets in that area? Why is the Minister loath to allow the microgenerators, which is all of us, to access the grid?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I will read the reply and then try to address the Deputy's questions. The 2016 programme for Government and 2015 White Paper on energy recognise that solar PV has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland’s energy future, and that it has the potential to contribute to meeting Ireland’s renewable energy and climate change objectives. While the White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland’s energy generation portfolio and, largely, decarbonising the sector by 2050, it does not set out targets for specific renewable technologies but rather provides a framework to guide policy between now and 2030. My Department is developing a new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions to EU-wide targets by 2030. The design of the new scheme has included an extensive economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting solar PV, both rooftop and ground-mounted, and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The analysis indicates that a number of renewable technologies, including solar PV, have converging and in some cases overlapping cost ranges and it is widely recognised that solar PV technology has become more cost-competitive for electricity generation over the past number of years, not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  I am keen for this new scheme to encourage the diversification of renewable energy technologies in Ireland while being mindful of the need to minimise the costs to consumers through the public service obligation. I am well aware of the very strong level of interest in solar PV in Ireland due to its potential role in Ireland’s future energy mix and I have written to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, highlighting my view that planning guidelines will need to be developed. In this regard, officials from my Department are engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. In January, I announced a proposed pilot scheme for microgeneration that will target solar PV and self-consumption among domestic customers, which is due to commence this summer.  Further details of this scheme will be made available when I have received a study being undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland into the likely uptake and demand for the scheme and have had an opportunity to consider its analysis.

He referred to specific targets but surely he should have targets set for the 2030 and 2050 deadlines. The UK has 8.4 GW of solar capacity and Germany has approximately 35 GW. The Irish Solar Energy Association's chief executive, a former Deputy, Mr. Michael McCarthy, stated that the potential in Ireland was approximately 3.7 GW. Cost and the question of how it will impact on consumers are relevant issues. Has there been a cost-benefit evaluation of a subsidy for solar arrays via the public service obligation? Is such a subsidy being considered? Regarding microgeneration, there was disappointment that the Minister did not introduce supports for the SME sector and farms. That would have encouraged wider microgeneration nationally. There seems to be great reluctance to allow microgeneration to feed into the national grid. In fact, the Minister stated that it is difficult to manage but surely that would be a task for ESB Networks.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	Some supports are available for SMEs through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Once we get microgeneration off the ground, I intend to see those supports expanded. The experience across Europe is that there are technical challenges with microgeneration. Strengthening the grid to deal with microgeneration output would require a significant amount of investment. In light of electric cars and so forth, the current trend is towards self-consumption. We can provide a cheaper and more effective solution to homeowners through microgeneration and self-consumption. We want to pilot this approach in order to determine whether it can work. There are 658 applications to connect solar arrays to the grid. This would bring 6.533 GW to the grid. However, the current winter peak demand is 5.5 GW. As such, there is a significant oversubscription to meet existing, not to mention future, demand.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The number of proposals is extraordinary. It is welcome that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will work closely together on the planning front. When examining some of the applications, we were all struck by how one needed to cover the space of a GAA pitch plus a rugby or soccer pitch under an array just to generate 1 MW. Some 25 acres would be required to generate 5 MW. This means that there is a considerable issue regarding land use. Other issues have arisen during planning processes such as, for example, the impact on landscapes, the question of electromagnetic fields, inverters and transformers and the noise created by some of the systems that have to be used. That there have been so many applications is welcome, but the situation needs to be kept under observation. Regarding the 2030 targets, does the Minister believe that microgeneration and solar arrays will play a fundamental role in supplying a more sustainable base load?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Yes. Microgeneration, rooftop, SME and ground-mounted solar power will form part of the energy mix over the next decade. To be honest, though, I suspect that the heavy lifting will be done offshore. This country's potential, in particular off the coast of Deputy Dooley's constituency, is significant. We need to develop that resource. We are on the cutting edge of research in that regard but we also need to be on the cutting edge in the context of deployment. We have many of the fundamental building blocks in place but we need to build on them. Solar will play a greater role in the first half of the next decade than it will in the second, when, in my view, offshore renewables will play a key role.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The issue of renewable energy is close to my heart. In 11 years' time, no more peat will be burned in power stations because of our international commitments. At best, though, we will only go a quarter of the way towards meeting our obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the programme for Government, we are supposed to reduce emissions by 20% by 2020. According to the EPA, however, the best case scenario now is 4% or 5%. The programme for Government states, "We will support the transition of peat power plants to greater amounts of biomass, and we will work with industry to develop a sustainable indigenous supply chain." Where stands this commitment? The Edenderry power plant in north Offaly is importing biomass from the US. At one point, it imported biomass from Indonesia. The carbon footprint involved in transporting biomass all the way to Ireland makes a mockery of any attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impact of burning palm oil husks from Indonesia and levelling forests in the southern US to feed energy plants in Ireland is crazy because it is causing an environmental disaster in those countries.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	No more than is the case with Deputy Stanley, this issue is very close to my heart. I have a large personal interest in it. I should also declare two vested interests, those being, Lanesborough and Shannonbridge. There has been significant progress to date in the use of biomass in Ireland. In 2016, 6.8% of energy consumption in the heat sector came from renewable sources. Of this, three quarters came from biomass. Biomass also contributes to renewable electricity production, including through co-firing at the Edenderry power station. In addition, bioenergy in the form of biofuels makes up the majority of the renewable energy used in the transport sector. The draft bioenergy plan, published in 2014, establishes the broader context for the development of Ireland's bioenergy sector. It recognises that meeting the demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic and employment benefits and contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. The plan highlights a range of supply-side and demand-side measures that are needed to release the full potential of the domestic biomass sector in Ireland. Supply-side measures, such as support for bioenergy crops, fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed. However, I highlight the recent significant increases in support under the forestry for fibre scheme that were made as part of the mid-term review of the forestry programme. These supports will provide an increased incentive for landowners considering planting forestry to supply the energy sector. A key demand-side measure is the support scheme for renewable heat. I secured Government approval for this scheme in December and expect it to become operational later this year, subject to EU state aid approval. The objective of the scheme is to increase the level of renewable energy and reduce emissions in the heat sector. In addition, the scheme will open up new opportunities for indigenous biomass feedstock producers by incentivising opportunities for renewable heat technologies, including biomass boiler installations. I note that the scheme will include strict sustainability criteria covering the biomass supply chain.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 As operator of the co-firing power plant in Edenderry, Bord na Móna prioritises domestic biomass supply, with every domestic tonne of biomass displacing an imported tonne. I am informed that approximately 80% of the biomass supplied to Edenderry in 2017 was indigenous. Bord na Móna supports the development of the domestic biomass market via its bioenergy division, which works to mobilise the biomass supply potential of privately owned forestry, thereby providing further opportunities for sustainable indigenous employment. The ESB operates the power station at Shannonbridge, known as West Offaly Power. I understand that the ESB plans to convert this plant to co-firing with biomass, along with the power station in Lanesborough, known as Lough Ree Power. While there may be a need to source some of the biomass for the stations internationally in the short term, the conversion of the peat plants to biomass over time can facilitate the development of domestic and local biomass supply chains. This is important in the context of the economic and employment aspects of the transition to a low-energy future, as set out in the national mitigation plan.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	What I am trying to get across to the Minister is that while converting to biomass is great, we are only doing more damage if we are hauling it thousands of miles and levelling forests in other countries. I welcome that Bord na Móna has abandoned the plan to build a wood pellet plant in the US to feed plants in Ireland. Apart from the carbon miles on such imports, the environmental implications meant it would have been a crazy enterprise from day one. Biomass must be grown in Ireland. There is an opportunity to do so on land that is not suitable for tillage. There are thousands of acres of such land across north Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and, I am sure, Roscommon. While travelling through that area down the years, I have seen land that is not good for arables but can grow willow and other crops that can be used to generate renewable energy and create employment. We must start creating a native biomass industry. The miscanthus scheme was a disaster and there were only four applications in respect of the willow scheme in 2015. What analysis has there been of which crop grown on marginal land is best for the sequestration of carbon?What work is being done with Coillte, Bord na Móna, the ESB and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine? Farmers are burning straw and bushes all over the place, which is biomass. In addition, forestry thinnings are not being utilised properly. We need to join up those pieces and start to utilise biomass in a native industry, in addition to getting farmers on marginal land to grow willow and other crops for renewable energy.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	First, 80% of the biomass used in Edenderry in 2017 was from indigenous sources. The objective is that the biomass in Edenderry, Lanesborough and Shannonbridge will be from indigenous sources. The supplier of the biomass to those three plants, and one of the major suppliers in the country in relation to the support scheme for renewable heat, will be Bord na Móna BioEnergy, which is a joint venture between Bord na Móna and Coillte. To clarify, willow will not grow on marginal land so as to provide any type of yield. Deputy Durkan will confirm that for me. He is a far greater expert on the subject than I am. Willow will only grow on arable land. We have a lot of land that was traditionally used for beet plants not just in Thurles, but also in Tuam, that could supply biomass. The most successful crop to date for planting on marginal land seems to be eucalyptus. That is being piloted on marginal land by Bord na Móna at the moment. Sustainability is one of the conditions in Lanesborough, Shannonbridge and Edenderry, and in the support scheme for renewable heat and for Bord na Móna BioEnergy, and every possible tonne of cuttings and biomass that is available in Ireland is to be utilised before we would consider any imports.

One can see the smoke blowing out over the road. It would be preferable to use cuttings for biomass to feed the energy plants. I impress on the Minister to need to get moving. We have had trials with miscanthus and willow. I know willow will not grow on very poor land but land is available that was used for arable purposes that is close to boggy areas that will grow willow. I welcome the trials the Minister mentioned that are being carried out on eucalyptus. We must involve the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in addition to Bord na Móna and Coillte. The joint venture is to be welcomed but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a significant role to play. Farm waste must be utilised. We must move beyond a view that the only products coming out the farm gate is beef, milk or pork. There are many other products, including farm waste, and cash can be earned from utilising farm waste properly. I urge the Minister to talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the issue to see how we can best approach it because it is not best practice to burn biomass in the corner of fields.

All of those engagements are taking place right across the board. Specifically on farm waste, Deputy Stanley is correct. Within the national development plan, there is a specific provision to look at utilising farm waste and the brown bin waste for use in biogas or biomethane plants that would supply district heating systems to towns. That has been done very effectively in Wales and there is no reason that we cannot do it here. We are engaged on the issue. A working group is examining district heating at the moment. We are looking specifically at the Irish Glass Bottle site in Dublin. We are also engaging with South Dublin County Council on its plans for district heating. The intention is to have a blueprint that could then be replicated elsewhere across the country using farm waste and domestic organic waste as the feed stock for such district heating systems.

I am seeking to ascertain the extent to which it is anticipated that we can meet the targets to which we have already signed up in terms of emissions.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	Meeting Ireland's EU targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 2030 will be extremely challenging. The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in April 2017, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020 in the context of a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels. The projected shortfall in our targets reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland's 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. For 2030, the recently agreed EU effort sharing regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each member state for the period from 2021 to 2030. Ireland’s target under this regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although this first plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium and long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. Building on the national mitigation plan, the publication in February of the national development plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost €22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, which is €1 in every €5 of all the funding set out in the national development plan.

I refer, for example, to a greater encouragement of and reliance on electric cars, a greater reliance on forestry which can utilise marginal land such as bogland that only needs to be harvested once every 30 or 40 years, and greater use of existing solar and wind energy where possible. Solar energy can and should be generated on marginal land to a far greater extent. We must also consider the plantation of species more readily capable of sequestering carbon such as the ones that are well known like Sitka spruce and western red cedar, which have the capacity to absorb something like four times the level of carbon as ash, sycamore or other such species of tree.

Biodiversity is also an issue to be considered in this regard. Right across my own part of the country there is effectively a monoculture in relation to forestry. The investment that we make today in terms of forestry will really only have an impact on our climate targets post 2030. The investment that we made 15 or 20 years ago is having an impact today and for the next decade. That is already counted in. Part of the problem is investing today to get a long-term dividend. Deputy Durkan raised other issues such as biodiversity and land use management. There is a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change report due out at the end of next year which will look at land use and land use change, which I think will drive a lot of the discussion in that regard. We are now rolling out a programme across the country for electric vehicles. A substantial number of motor dealers now provide test drives. A roadshow will be rolled out at agricultural shows, shopping centres and at various events with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, over the summer months so that people get the opportunity to test drive electric vehicles.There is no doubt that an electric vehicle is the solution for the vast majority of commuters today.

From my own information, I believe that there are a number of options, including forestry, that will have a greater effect than is anticipated, and much earlier than anticipated, because some of the species grow rapidly and, in so doing, absorb a great deal of the gases that we are so concerned about. I do not think biomass is viable as a long-term solution. It would not be a good idea to become dependent on it since the entire country would need to be planted in biomass, and half the neighbouring island too, and I am not sure it would agree to that. It would be hugely beneficial if the Minister were to set a new campaign in motion to identify those issues that are most likely to have a considerable impact with the least impact on the environment other than a beneficial one, and, more importantly, less of an impact on agrifood businesses on which this country depends greatly for a living.

In the short term, we are looking at it with regard to power generation but it is far more effective for heat. As we start harvesting our forestry crops, the leftover residues will be the main bulk to provide that feedstock. Biomass crops can complement that to ensure that we are not importing biomass from halfway around the world. The Deputy is right that there needs to be a far broader debate. It comes back to the conversation I had with Deputy Stanley earlier about some of the resources that we have on farms. One of the biggest challenges I have relates to air quality in the short term, meeting our ammonia targets, and the better management by farmers of the use of slurry, not just from an environmental and water quality perspective. Also, this year, because of the financial constraints on farmers, we need to use slurry as a fertiliser rather than it being perceived by farmers as a waste.

The Minister knows that the Sick of Plastic campaign day last Saturday by Friends of the Earth and others was a big success. There is a significant public appetite for change and the public is switched on to this issue. Young people specifically are tuned into what we need to do. We need to step up to the plate in this House, turn industry in a different direction and reduce the massive and completely unnecessary volumes of plastic waste.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 30 together. Tackling the negative impact of plastic on our environment is a national and global challenge. I am working with my colleagues in Government and internationally to ensure that Ireland acts to protect our environment and at the same time provides new opportunities in a circular economy. I recently wrote to EU Commissioner Karmenu Vella, who has responsibility for environment, maritime affairs and fisheries, to welcome the European strategy on plastics. I assured him that Ireland will fully embrace the ambition of the new strategy and indeed will strive to go beyond it. In response to the list of measures announced, I asked the Commissioner to focus, in particular, on the more difficult non-recyclable plastics, such as soft wrapping, film and single-use items like coffee cups and plastic cutlery. The Commission has indicated that an announcement will be made next month about its intentions in this area. I believe that this will support EU member states in taking action on single-use items and will result in new legislative proposals to take action at a European market level. In that context, since I first mooted the introduction of a levy on single-use non-recyclable coffee cups, some retailers are now moving to replace their non-recyclable cups with compostable cups. To support the elimination of single-use plastic cups by industry, I do not intend to introduce a levy on compostable cups. However, I am looking at a range of other potential levies on single-use plastic items, unless there is constructive engagement by industry with my Department to eliminate these environmentally damaging plastic items. I am also looking at the plastic strategy's recommendations for national administrations to see what else can be delivered in a short timeframe. Many of the measures recommended in the strategy are already well-embedded into Irish resource management. These measures include the existing extended producer responsibility schemes run by Repak and the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, the landfill levy, and the plastic bag levy, as well as robust enforcement around illegal dumping and landfilling. Although I am pleased that consecutive annual national litter pollution monitoring surveys have shown that the litter situation has been generally improving across the country, I am still concerned that fines for offences under the Litter Pollution Acts do not serve as a sufficient deterrent. Therefore, it is my intention to seek Government approval for substantial increases in the near future. Similarly, consumers need to be supported in their efforts to do the right thing around plastic recycling. The recent national recycling list and recycling ambassador programme try to ensure these valuable materials are used as a resource for our communities and economy rather than being wasted. I have asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to look at the merits of a deposit and refund scheme at a national level. I look forward to working with the committee when it delivers its final report. In the meantime, I have asked my officials to set up a pilot scheme. This will allow me assess the likely impacts of the deposit and refund scheme in an Irish context. On marine plastic, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, will bring in a Bill to prohibit the manufacturing, selling, importing or exporting of cosmetics, personal care products, detergents and scouring agents containing plastic microbeads that are liable to be washed into wastewater systems with the potential to reach our rivers, lakes and seas.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I thank the Minister for the reply. Some 983,380 tonnes of packaging waste were created in 2015, with 32% of plastic waste escaping collection, and that is a huge figure. The Minister referred to marine plastic. The study published by NUI Galway showed that 70% of fish in a remote part of the North Atlantic had plastic in their stomachs, having ingested it, which shows that we have a real problem. We saw the plastic islands in the ocean on television recently. This issue is now coming to the top of the public agenda. I ask the Minister to bring in a ban on microbeads. There is no need for microbeads in toothpaste or washing powder. There is no need for it in anything. It is simply a gimmick on supermarket shelves. Let us ban microbeads completely. I ask the Minister to do that. China said it will not take our waste mountain of plastic because much of it is contaminated. If we have to send plastic waste abroad, we are trying to stop it at the wrong end. We need to stop and reduce the manufacturing of it. What are the alternatives to China and what will happen to the mountain of plastic waste that was being shipped out?

It would have been more helpful if this could have been done at a co-ordinated European level rather than a domestic level but we are determined to bring forward legislation in this area to ban microbeads. With regard to China, a reason that the Chinese closed the market was the scale of contamination. We are trying to reduce the contamination and that is why we have, as of last November, a uniform recycling list across the country. Whether one uses a green bin or a blue bin in different parts of the country, the same recyclables go into it. We are trying, through recycling ambassadors, to encourage people to present the recyclable material in a clean manner. The Deputy is right that the priority must be not to generate the waste in the first place or if we are generating that waste, for it to be in a manner that can be easily recycled. I am taking this up with my colleagues on the Council of Ministers, both privately and publicly, and directly with the Commission. I hope that we will make progress in this area in the short term.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	One might wonder what would happen if we did not have voluntary groups picking rubbish from the rivers and canals. The Minister may have seen the group on television the other evening of people in Dublin picking up plastic rubbish from rivers and canals around the city. That happens right across the country and we support greater enforcement. The "Sick of Plastic" campaign run last Saturday indicates there is a major appetite among citizens to reduce this huge volume of plastic, as 40% of Europe's plastic is in packaging. We need a new initiative. The Minister mentioned a deposit and return scheme and I brought forward a Bill to reduce the amount of plastic waste and to put in place such a deposit and return scheme based on the model being used in other countries. We also need to have changes to the household waste collection process as in parts of the country it is not fit for purpose. I ask the Minister, through Repak and the Department's enforcement activities, to encourage a reduction in the production of plastic. We must get this across to manufacturers. If we can stop the supply being fed through manufacturers to wholesalers, to retailers and to the shopper, we will be winning.

If he has any specific details, I would like to hear them. I do not like hearing such comments and we want to ensure we have a system that is fit for purpose. The Deputy is 100% correct that the priority must be on trying to reduce generation of this in the first place. What comes to mind is something on Twitter recently where a retailer in Italy sold peeled oranges in plastic containers, and this led to a huge public outcry. Consumers are moving against such a practice. The initiative taken by Super Valu on Saturday and which is practiced by some of the Super Valu supermarkets across the country on an ongoing basis is like something we have been discussing privately with the retail sector. Super Valu must be complimented on that. If much of the waste is collected in supermarkets, the retailers and producers will very quickly realise they must take action quickly on the matter.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Minister should start discussing it with Dunnes Stores.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I ask about the measures being taken to combat the emerging challenge arising from a shortage of sites for the licensed disposal of construction waste and whether the Minister will make a statement on the matter.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	I thank Deputy Lahart but I did not think he was going to ask the question. Waste management planning, including that regarding infrastructure provision, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended. Under section 60(3) of that Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of its statutory functions under the Act. However, my Department has and will continue to engage with the three regional waste management planning lead authorities and other environmental regulatory bodies on the issue of having sufficient capacity and systems in place to manage construction and demolition waste. Soil and stone waste management capacity challenges were raised by the Construction Industry Federation in 2016. In December 2016, the regional waste management planning offices jointly published a report on national construction and demolition soil and stone recovery and disposal capacity. Meetings were held in 2017 between my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the County and City Management Association, the regional waste management planning offices and the Construction Industry Federation to discuss construction and demolition waste issues arising, primarily the capacity of the sector's arrangements to manage its soil and stone. It has been acknowledged that the granting of a number of waste licences by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 for clean soil and stone facilities has addressed this issue. Additional options for clean soil and stone capacity are being considered. In January 2018, my Department issued a short consultation paper to stakeholders on the tonnage thresholds for waste management facilities for the recovery of soil and stone. My Department is currently considering approximately a dozen submissions received in that regard. Finally, it is also intended shortly to convene a construction waste resource group, which will comprise the key construction and demolition waste stakeholders. It will provide a useful platform to discuss and monitor construction and demolition waste issues, including the capacity of the sector to manage its construction and demolition waste.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	This question was prompted as a result of a recent article in a Sunday newspaper. There is always the possibility of illegal dumping as a result of a lack of capacity. Is the Minister satisfied the capacity is there to deal with the problem, particularly with the ambitious plans that the Government has in the context of Project Ireland 2040 in the Dublin area, for example? An amount of excavation work would be required for a number of projects. I note the Minister's comments on the convening of the group and I know he does not have direct responsibility for this. Will he agree to revert to the Dáil on the progress made with the group?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I am absolutely quite happy to report either through the committee or in another way about the group. There is no problem in doing that. There are three types of construction waste and I need to get my own head around this. There is "clean" or greenfield construction waste, which is topsoil and stone on a greenfield site. There is brownfield construction waste, which could include the demolition of an existing building or brownfield site that contains non-hazardous soil. There is also construction and demolition finds, sorting of residues and rubble. We have sufficient capacity to deal with greenfield sites. We do not have enough capacity to deal with brownfield sites and rubble. There is a concern that in the second half of this year we will not have enough capacity in the country to meet demand. That is why this group has been set up. There is currently engagement with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, looking at possible uses for some of this waste and a licensing regime must be gone through. I understand the EPA is currently awaiting information from the Construction Industry Federation on that aspect, and this would allow it to be in a position to make a decision on alternative uses for some of the construction and demolition waste.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I welcome the opportunity to provide the house with an update on the Government's national broadband plan. The plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business has access to a high-quality, high-speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The intervention area to be served by the State intervention includes some urban areas but it predominantly covers rural and regional Ireland, which requires a step change to bridge the digital divide separating it from urban counterparts. As the Deputy knows, my Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company that will roll out a new high-speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages. My Department will engage with the successful bidder on the most efficient roll-out of the network. As part of the deployment, the successful bidder will be required to provide early high-speed connectivity to the previously identified high-speed strategic community access hubs across the country. The network that will be built by the successful bidder in the State intervention area will be a fully open access network providing wholesale telecommunications services. The contract will mandate that all retail service providers have open access to the infrastructure, which should result in consumers having access to a range of providers. The terms and conditions of this access will be monitored through the contract. To answer the Deputy's question, there will be equal access to this network. It will be built by enet-SSE.It will be a wholesale company and will lease that line to the traditional retailers available in Kilkenny city and every other city across the country to provide the same package and offer to people in rural areas.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I wish to point out that the mechanisms currently in place for public representatives to follow up on behalf of their constituents in respect of broadband are basically non-existent. That is important. I recently contacted the Department’s dedicated broadband email helpline regarding a constituent of mine in Ballybeg, Rossbercon, New Ross, whose case I have previously raised with the Minister. The residence is located in the middle of a dark blue area on the national broadband plan map but has no access to broadband. It took a month to secure a response from the Minister's Department stating that it is aware of a number of residences in dark blue areas which cannot access high-speed broadband and that it is keeping a list of same. I had to read that a few times before I could believe it. I had to wait a month for an email telling me that the Department is keeping a list. Meanwhile, my constituent is surrounded by neighbours who all have access to high-speed broadband but he cannot access it and no one can explain why. As the endless wait for works to commence under the national broadband plan rumbles on, will the Minister speak to his officials about providing an adequate service to public representatives? Will he speak to Eir about setting up a dedicated Oireachtas query line similar to those for the ESB, Electric Ireland and Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI? It is important that is done to facilitate Members in representing their constituents.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I apologise to Deputy Aylward for the delay in responding to him, which is not good enough. I have previously raised the issue with my officials and I will do so once more on foot of the Deputy's comments. As regards Eir, I hope to meet with its new owners early next month and I will inform them of the Deputy's comments on a query line for Members. On the dark blue area, there is a problem across the country with areas in which we are told by private operators that high-speed broadband is available but it is not so available at a minimum of 30 mb per second 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is why on several occasions in the House before we locked down the map I asked Members to make the public aware that if they were in a dark blue area but were not receiving that minimum basic standard, they should come forward with their postcode so we could amend the map. We are noting all such areas. We will amend the map to reflect that, and those areas and premises will be addressed through a universal service obligation or the national broadband plan. All premises, whether in O'Connell Street in Dublin or the most peripheral part of County Kilkenny, County Roscommon or County Clare, will have access to high-speed broadband.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	I ask the Minister to request that service when he speaks to Eir. A similar service is available with other organisations such as the ESB and is very helpful for Members in making representations. I ask the Minister to facilitate that dedicated line with Eir such that Members of this House can represent their constituents and find out what the problem is, unlike the situation I have raised whereby I received no response for a month and the response then received was negative. Is the Minister worried that there is only one bidder left for the contract to roll out the national broadband plan? We started off with three or four, which became two and then, eventually, one. In terms of competition, is the Minister satisfied that the remaining bidder will be able to provide the service he envisages according to the timescale he has set out? Is 2020-21 still the date for the roll-out of that broadband? Will the Minister stick to that target or will it be pushed out in six months' time, as has happened before?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I will take up with Eir the issue of a dedicated line for Members. As regards there being one bidder remaining for the contract, I am confident that we can roll this out. From engagement with the company, I believe it is ascertaining how it can fast track the build and it is already engaging in that regard. Significant progress has been made since this issue was last discussed in the House and I am determined that the contract will be signed as quickly as possible and, more importantly, that the final phase of the roll-out across the country will begin. We expect that 90% of the country will be covered by 2020. The Comreg quarterly reports indicate significant ongoing improvements in the quality and coverage of broadband that people have and provide evidence of a significant step up in that regard. However, I will not be happy until every home, business and farm has access to high-speed broadband.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	The Minister is aware from the ongoing representations I have made to him in meetings that the totally inadequate broadband telecommunications infrastructure in Cavan-Monaghan is a source of serious concern to households, businesses, farmers and the entire community. Although there have been some launches of upgraded infrastructure by various companies, there is a constant concern about the delays and tardiness in having the infrastructure upgraded. Can the Minister ask the companies to give some priority to the Border region in view of the many difficulties we currently face and those we will face due to Brexit?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 43 together. I am glad to return the topic of the national broadband plan and to speak on the matter of broadband services in counties Cavan and Monaghan in particular. As I have related to the House previously, I am only too aware of the impact a lack of reliable high-speed broadband has on the ability of citizens to carry out important tasks in their daily lives. I fully acknowledge the impact this has on people in Cavan and Monaghan which, along with my own county of Roscommon and County Galway, are among the areas with the lowest percentage of premises having access to high-speed broadband. I am certain the Deputies’ constituents have voiced their frustrations and concerns on this matter just as strongly as mine. The importance of this service to all citizens underpins the Government's continued commitment to the national broadband plan.   Some 19,500 premises in County Cavan and 15,000 in County Monaghan currently have access to high-speed broadband. Approximately 2,300 of those in County Cavan and 2,000 of those in County Monaghan received that access via the ongoing commercial roll-out by Eir.  The roll-out is subject to a commitment agreement I entered into with the company in April 2017 in regard to its plans to provide high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Eir has committed to completing the roll-out by the end of this year. A further 5,500 premises in Cavan and 2,500 in Monaghan are to be completed as part of that ongoing roll-out. The remaining 17,000 premises in Cavan, and 15,500 in Monaghan, will receive a high-speed broadband connection via the national broadband plan State intervention phase. My Department is in the final stages of a formal procurement process to select a company that will roll out a new high-speed broadband network in the State intervention area. The Department will engage with the bidder to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract. The intention is that will be deployed across the country at the same time. In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the ongoing work of the mobile phone and broadband task force to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. Of the 40 actions identified by the task force for 2017, some 29 have been completed. Work on the remaining 11, along with 23 new measures, is part of the 2018 work programme of the task force and will lead to further improvements in services for consumers, including those in Cavan and Monaghan. Under the task force, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through broadband officers continues apace.  The broadband officers act as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local broadband officers on my Department's website.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I thank the Minister for his reply. He is well aware that target dates have not been met in the past. Will he ask the telecom companies to ensure that some priority is afforded to counties such as Cavan and Monaghan? He is well aware that our local economy is very much based on agrifood, construction products and engineering products. Those particular sectors are heavily dependent on exports to the British market. They face particular challenges at this time, and they will face further challenges when Britain leaves the European Union. They need whatever assistance the Government can give in ensuring that infrastructure is upgraded. It is not acceptable that some of those companies cannot conduct their business online as they need to. Can the Minister ask the companies to give some priority to regions that will be adversely impacted by Brexit?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I accept the point that Deputy Brendan Smith makes. He is correct. Rural communities that are dependent on agriculture, light engineering and the agrifood sectors are the ones that are most exposed to Brexit and have the most to gain by the delivery of the national broadband plan. That is why I am determined to ensure that we get this contract signed as quickly as possible, and more importantly, that we see the physical roll-out of infrastructure right across this country taking place as soon as possible. On an ongoing basis, I am engaging with fibre, wireless and mobile providers to see how the State can facilitate them in the commercial deployment of that infrastructure in order that the businesses to which the Deputy refers at least can be provided with a service, albeit not the gold-plated service they will get under the national broadband plan. At this stage, many of those businesses need a service. It would be great to have a high-speed service but a service is better than none. We are trying to ensure that at least that happens in the short term to ensure those companies have a service that meets their day-to-day needs, pending the roll-out of the national broadband plan.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I agree with the Minister. I know of instances where small-scale employers must drive into the nearest town to email quotes and invoices to businesses. It is not acceptable. I ask the Minister to ensure that the companies he spoke well about in the sectors that need particular assistance and are heavily dependent on the export market, especially the sterling market, are given particular attention by the telecommunications companies to ensure the necessary infrastructure is put in place as quickly as possible.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	In response to Deputy Brendan Smith's point about businesses being obliged to travel into the local town, it is absolutely soul-destroying to see that happening in this day and age. That is not something that I want to see continuing. That is why the Government and I are determined to ensure we unlock as much commercial investment as possible, first through the broadband task force, in the form of wireless deployment or any other type of telecommunications deployment. This is intended to ensure the particular practice referred to does not continue. People should at least have a basic broadband service in order that they can use email. They should not be in a situation where they have to travel into the local town to do that. Second, with the way technology is changing, many of those businesses now are using the cloud to provide services, including accountancy or back-office services. One way to drive efficiency in many of those businesses is to have back-office services based in the cloud. They can only do that if they have access to decent high-speed broadband. It is hugely frustrating to see what is going on at present. That is why I am committed, along with the Government and, in fairness, every colleague in the House, to ensuring that we can deliver this infrastructure and deliver it as quickly as possible to every single premises, business, farm and home.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	St. Gabriel's special school in Bishopstown, County Cork, provides education for 43 special needs children with very severe and profound diagnoses of autism. That includes intellectual disability with autism, probably the most severe and profound condition that is catered for in the education system. These are children who should be our number one priority, but they are being neglected by the Government in their need for a new school building. The parents say they feel forgotten. The existing school building has huge issues. It is substandard. The bathroom is not big enough for wheelchairs to fit, there is no hot running water, the roof leaks, there are no dedicated toilets for children with medical needs, there is a lack of infection control and the sensory room is in a windowless outbuilding. I could go on. The parents are now crowdfunding for €200,000. Parents of a school of 43 children with severe and profound conditions are attempting to raise €200,000 to carry out repairs to make the school habitable. That school is illustrative of many other schools throughout the country, both special schools and mainstream primary schools. Parents all over the country are raising money for the day-to-day expenditure needed to keep schools going. Quite simply, the capitation grant is not anywhere near sufficient to meet the costs of running a school. According to the chief inspector's report, spending per pupil in Ireland is less than the European Union average or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average. According to a recent Grant Thornton report, the capitation grant now covers approximately 52% of the cost of running a school, depending on whether the school is small, medium or large. In all cases however, we are looking at situations where the capitation is much less than what is actually necessary. The average capitation grant of €46,000 in 2016 was clearly insufficient to meet the average general expenditure costs of about €91,000. This includes the heating expenditure and all the basic operational costs. Voluntary schools at secondary level are in a similar situation. I visited several secondary schools recently. Maintenance costs are a big issue for them. They do not have the day-to-day resources to meet them. The programme for Government includes a commitment to multi-annual increases in capitation grants and funding for schools under a number of headings, but it has not been implemented. Last year we forced the Government to act on the pupil-teacher ratio as part of the confidence and supply agreement, but the Government was resistant on the issue of capitation for some reason. I would say there are three ways to bring some ease to schools. One is to commit in the next budget to a phased increase in the capitation rate for schools. Second, the minor works grant scheme should be a permanent feature as a non-discretionary payment to schools by the Government and this should be provided for statutorily as an annual payment, not just something that may happen next year or the following year. Similarly, summer work schemes should be annual and should be fixed in order that schools can plan with some degree of certainty as to the income that will help them to meet the day-to-day running costs and repair and maintenance costs.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	This year the Government will invest €10 billion in education, the highest ever spending on education in the history of the State. In fact, €1 billion more is being spent on education this year than when the current Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independent Members came to office. That is money well spent. It is taxpayers' money invested in our children and in education. It is invested in giving them the best opportunities in life and ensuring they can access the best jobs when they grow up and become adults. That involves a lot of investment in school buildings as well. I cannot comment on the individual case that Deputy Martin raised but we have seen an enormous amount of new school building all around the country. My own constituency, a very rapidly developing area, has had a number of new schools built, including secondary schools and primary schools. The quality of those buildings is really excellent. I also have seen extensions built all over the country. In the case of large projects, 340 large projects have been delivered since 2011 and 175,000 additional school places have been provided, recognising the growth in our population and the current demographic bulge. We have 6,000 additional teachers working in our education system and 3,000 additional special needs assistants, SNAs. We now invest more in special education than we do in higher education. Some 150 new autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units are being provided per year, which is an enormous investment. As Deputy Micheál Martin mentioned, the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase capitation funding in the next several years and there is a commitment in the Action Plan for Education to do the same. Even the wealthiest countries, those that are doing well economically, as we are, cannot do everything they would like to do in any one year. When it comes to capital projects - new schools, refurbishments and extensions - it will always be the case that there will be a pipeline of projects. It is never possible to do every project and everything one would like to do in education, health or any similar area in a given year. One has to prioritise and last year in particular we prioritised new schools where they were needed, increased teacher numbers, reduced the pupil-teacher ratio, and introduced new examination subjects such as physical education and computer science. As part of the budget, which is five months away, we will consider an increase in capitation in line with the commitment made in the programme for Government.  I also ask the main Opposition party to tell us what its priorities are because I hear its education spokesperson demanding more spending on new school buildings one day, the next day demanding full pay restoration or full pay equality for young teachers and the following day demanding an increase in capitation. All of that does not add up and Deputy Micheál Martin knows as well as I do that one cannot deliver all of those things in one year. What is Fianna Fáil's priority? What would it put first? Would it be capitation, capital spending for new schools or pay equalisation for new teachers, because it cannot be all three? What is its priority?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	We put our priorities into the confidence and supply agreement. The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio would not have occurred if it had not been provided for in the confidence and supply agreement. Fine Gael resisted the reduction, just as it resisted the National Treatment Purchase Fund.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	Fianna Fáil no longer has confidence in the Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	Likewise, the Fine Gael Party resisted postgraduate grants which we put into the confidence and supply agreement. The same applied to ex quota career guidance counsellors. There would have been no movement on career guidance counselling if I had not insisted that, despite Fine Gael objections, it be included in the confidence and supply agreement. I am not interested in a tit-for-tat argument about who does what better. The parents of 43 children with severe and profound diagnoses of intellectual disability and autism do not want a figure of €10 billion thrown at them. They want a new school and a sense that somebody is listening to and aware of them because right now they do not have any such sense. I have met these parents. That is the problem and this is not about Deputies in a debating Chamber saying, "I will do it better than you do it", but about responding to real need. Last week, a list of 42 new schools was published. No one went looking for two of the schools in Cork that feature on the list, yet a school that has been seeking a new building for three or four years is not on any goddamn list. Does the Taoiseach understand the frustration of parents when faced with the juxtaposition of the Government publishing a fantasy list claiming it will build new schools in three or four years' time, while at the same time it cannot even get around to providing habitable conditions for children who have been diagnosed with severe and profound intellectual disabilities? The Taoiseach wants to know what my party's priorities are. Last year, we said our priorities were reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and increasing capitation. An increase in capitation is possible. It is unsustainable for schools to survive and meet their ongoing day-to-day running costs from the capitation grant they receive.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	It has started in more ways than one. Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of leniency in the sentences handed down for sexual crimes against women and children. In response, the Taoiseach gave his support for our call for the introduction of sentencing guidelines. I urge him and the Minister for Justice and Equality to support Sinn Féin's amendments to the Judicial Council Bill. As the Taoiseach is aware, I raise these matters on foot of an RTE "Prime Time" programme aired last night which centred on the case of three young girls who were raped by Keith Burke while in the care of a foster family in County Galway. Shock, heartbreak and anger best describe the reaction of the nation - shock at what the girls were subjected to and anger because of the way in which the agencies of the State, particularly the Health Service Executive, utterly failed to protect the children. In 2007, Rachel Barry disclosed to the HSE that she had been abused by Keith Burke. Her disclosure was judged to be credible by a subsequent HSE investigation. Rachel also disclosed that a second young girl known as Amy had been raped by Burke. A file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, but no prosecution followed. Incredibly, Amy and another child remained living in the Burke family home where Amy remained until she made a disclosure in 2011. For four years after the risk to this young girl was uncovered, she and other children were left in a setting in which the authorities knew they were at severe risk of rape and abuse. This risk, and the failure of State agencies to act, are best emphasised by the fact that a third victim was uncovered as a result of the investigation following Amy's disclosure. These were young girls who were already vulnerable - that is the precise reason they were in foster care - yet the State failed them when they most needed it. This represents another collapse in the systems and processes designed, we had all hoped, to protect and guard vulnerable children. It was not so long ago that the House discussed the harrowing case of Grace. It is an indictment of our system, therefore, that we come here again and again to express rightful outrage while knowing that it is only a matter of time before the next case arises. I am sure the Taoiseach agrees we cannot go on like this. There needs to be accountability. The Government must support the call for an independent inquiry into this case. Will it do so?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	I thank Deputy McDonald for raising this important issue. I had an opportunity to watch the "Prime Time" programme last night. Sexual crimes perpetrated against children are the worst form of crimes - they are abhorrent, unspeakable and unforgivable. It is particularly distressing and shocking that the young women in question were in State care.I noted some similarities with the Grace case in the south east. I commend the bravery of Sarah, Rachel and Amy in telling their story. In doing so, they will help others. I am sure of that. There is a criminal conviction in the case and the abuser is behind bars where he can do no harm to anyone. I am aware of the concern about the leniency of the sentence in this case. It is, of course, up to the DPP to decide in the coming weeks whether it is appropriate to appeal the sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. There will be an independent investigation by the national review panel, which is made up of independent professionals working in the field of child protection. In fact, the investigation is already under way, having commenced at the end of 2016, and is nearing completion. However, it was affected by the fact that a criminal case was in train. While I realise fully that the victims must relive the abuse they experienced every day, whether it is the smells, sounds or visual flashbacks, it is important to acknowledge that the abuse happened between ten and 15 years ago. Since then, a great deal has been done to improve child protection in the State. For example, the HSE is no longer responsible for child protection or foster care, responsibility for both of which now falls under the remit of a dedicated agency, namely, Tusla. We also have a Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a dedicated Minister at the Cabinet table. We have changed our Constitution to enshrine within it the rights of children and introduced mandatory reporting. All provisions of the Children First Act are now fully in force. We can honestly say that there has been a real change in the way we have prioritised child protection in the State since 2011, although there is always more to be done. We need to do a great deal more in this space in the period ahead.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	I join the Taoiseach in commending the women who have come through the awful ordeal that was visited on them as very small girls. I commend them on their bravery. I accept that the protection of our children is now a matter which looms large in public policy in a way that it did not ten or 15 years ago. However, there is no room for complacency. I recall very accurately that as we dealt with the Grace case, we discovered that there were still massive gaps and inadequacies in our child protection system, as well as a reluctance within parts of the HSE and other services to be held accountable when mistakes are made or systems failures identified. I ask the Taoiseach to tell us more about the independent investigation that he says commenced in 2016. That is, of course, prior to an apology being made to the victims in question. Is this the independent investigation for which the legal representatives of the victims have called? Have the victims and their legal representatives had access to the terms of reference of the inquiry and will they have an opportunity to provide testimony to it? If the Taoiseach could answer those questions in as precise terms as possible, I would appreciate it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	The national review panel was asked to investigate this case in April 2016, which is when the matter was referred. The panel is an independent body consisting of independent professionals from a range of disciplines engaged for their professional expertise. Tusla staff and some former children in care and their families have been interviewed by the panel. Tusla awaits the outcome of the review and has agreed to act on all of its findings and recommendations. I do not have the terms of reference in front of me. As I say, it is an independent panel. In the context of foster carers and foster families, it is important to note that foster parents are wonderful people in the vast majority of cases. They take vulnerable children who are often troubled, neglected or abandoned into their homes and look after them. We want more people to do this. It is important that we do not do anything which might discourage people from becoming foster parents or create the impression that they are not properly vetted. Before someone becomes a foster parent, there are several months of checks, including a medical check and a Garda check, a link-in with a social worker and training in child protection. We know, however, from recent reviews carried out by HIQA, which is now responsible for inspecting foster care, that this has not happened in some cases where Garda checks have not been conducted as frequently as they might have been. It is evident that we need to do a great deal more work in this area to ensure we raise standards further.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	The end of February saw the first ever prosecution resulting in a conviction in the UK of a corporate body for failure to prevent bribery. The case concerned the managing director of a company paying a £10,000 bribe to secure a contract worth £6 million. This was the first test of section 7 of the UK's Bribery Act, which provides that a corporate body is guilty of an offence if a person associated with it has been found guilty of corruption. Equivalent Irish legislation, namely the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill, came before the justice committee in March this year. The Bill incorporates the "failure to prevent" principle, copying the UK legislation, which is welcome. The legislation will be pointless and a mere fig-leaf reform, however, if the Government does not create an independent body with the necessary legal power to enforce the Bill's provision. Sadly, the legislation may have come too late for some organisations. We know for a fact that NAMA's chairperson and chief executive were aware of corruption taking place within the organisation to which they turned a blind eye. When it was discovered that a NAMA employee had been leaking debtor portfolio details to investment funds, NAMA's chair and chief executive called in Deloitte, not the Garda, to investigate. By coincidence, NAMA has, since its inception, paid Deloitte over €7 million in fees for receivership duties. If this is not a conflict of interest, I am not sure what would be. We know of ten more cases where senior executives in NAMA became aware of corruption by staff but dealt with it in-house instead of reporting it to the relevant authority. Sadly, it seems that NAMA will get away with it. NAMA is the only State agency that has a policy of deleting the emails of staff members one year after such staff have left its employment. It does not sound as if the organisation is too interested in transparency. Another serious development took place in February this year in relation to happenings in NAMA. A former NAMA staff member, Paul Pugh, was due to stand trial in the Dublin Circuit Court on 12 February for leaking highly sensitive information that NAMA was supposed to be keeping safe. For some strange reason, the DPP withdrew the case at the last minute. No explanation has been given as to why the proceedings have been halted and there is serious anger in certain quarters that this could have happened. If someone in the DPP's office saw fit in 2016 to recommend the prosecution of this NAMA official and to send him forward for trial, why was the prosecution halted and on whose instructions? If the Taoiseach does not have the answer at this stage, he should provide it to the House as soon as possible. There are a lot more questions than answers around how these individuals are operating.

This is not the place for us to make allegations, nor can I respond to them not knowing whether they are true or untrue. The DPP acts independently of the Government and does not receive direction from it. The DPP's office does not account to the Government for its decisions. From experience and following cases down the years, I am aware that when the DPP decides not to prosecute, it generally does so because it does not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case and secure a conviction. I cannot say in this individual case whether that is the position. I am not even sure I am allowed to ask. On the broader picture of fighting corruption and white collar crime, the Government published a package of measures last year to crack down on such crime in Ireland. This was produced back in November. Since then, the Department of Justice and Equality has taken this forward through three major legislative initiatives.The first is the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill which has made significant progress through the House with Report Stage to take place on 1 and 2 May. It is then planned to bring all Stages through the Seanad and have it passed before the summer recess. The Bill includes legislative provisions for recommendations arising from the Mahon tribunal. It will substantially advance Ireland in meeting its obligations under several international anti-corruption instruments. The major modernisation of the corruption offences law will repeal and replace seven previous Prevention of Corruption Acts, some of them dating back to 1889. It will consolidate, update and strengthen seven Bills for modern times. An amendment to the Bill was agreed by the Government yesterday which will ensure the full implementation of Article 7 of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, making it an offence to launder the proceeds of bribery outside Ireland involving a foreign public official, even if the bribery was not an offence in the place in which it was carried out. In addition to that, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has brought forward the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill as part of the Government's package of measures. I take the Deputy’s point in this regard that one can have all the legislation one likes, but if one does not enforce it, or have the power or strength to enforce it, then it counts for little. We indicated already, as part of our package of reforms, that we intend to strengthen, expand and beef up the role of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. It will be moved from being an office within the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to a stand-alone bureau of investigation, a sort of Irish FBI, if one likes, when it comes to white-collar crime and corporate enforcement.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I am not making allegations. I am stating facts. I want the Taoiseach to dig deeper. Not only does NAMA have a tendency to play a bit footloose with criminal law, but it seems to care little for the data protection law. Two months ago, the Data Protection Commissioner found that NAMA was in breach of its obligations under data protection law regarding requests for data from the O'Flynn group. I have read the 67-page report and believe the Government should be concerned. The O'Flynns had asked for all personal data NAMA held on them, which is their right. NAMA initially agreed to undertake a full search for this. Some 14 months later, however, it told the commissioner it had decided not to do the requested searches. I have no doubt the workings of NAMA will prove to be the biggest financial scandal in the history of the State when the truth eventually emerges. Former NAMA officials and their closest friends now control vast amounts of Dublin's housing stock. They have morphed from being civil servants into millionaires, quicker than the Government can build a semi-detached house. I know the Taoiseach is a busy man and it cannot be possible for him to be on top of every issue. I appeal to him to consider, however, putting NAMA on his radar and address the fact that it lacks transparency and accountability. There was much talk in the House last week about insider information but a blind eye is being turned to NAMA. The Taoiseach is ignoring it at his peril.

I have no idea whether they are true or not. I have no doubt the Deputy believes them. However, it would not be the first time in this House that Deputies put allegations on the record of the House in good faith, perhaps believing them, and we subsequently found out they were untrue. That is why we all need to be cautious in this area. NAMA is very much on my radar. It is coming to the end of its remit as a public body which was set up as a solution to the banking crisis. We now believe it will make a small profit and remit that to the State. At that point, it will have served its purpose and have ended its remit.

On the N70 road to the west of Blackwater Bridge, on the Kenmare to Sneem road, there is a 4 km section between Foley’s Bend and the west of Tahilla Church where two large vehicles cannot pass when they meet each other. It is not safe. A lorry or bus and one car cannot pass each other but have to reverse. Can one imagine that on a busy national secondary road? An EIS, environmental impact statement, design and CPO, compulsory purchase order, process is being progressed. Improvement works will cost between €8 million and €10 million, depending on what the tenders come in at. Will the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, ensure funding is made available for this section? There is also another section of a kilometre just west of Blackwater Bridge. No design has been progressed on this yet but this is dangerous. I know it myself. If an articulated lorry passes a car on this part of the road, the car will pass the cab fine but will be caught between the trailer and the ditch. If the car cannot stop, it is stuck in the lorry or the ditch. That improvement would cost between €2 million and €2.5 million. Will the Government make that funding available? The R551, between Ardfert and Ballyheigue, often gets flooded when there is a high tide and heavy rain. Approximately 200 m of this road becomes impassable with a mix of salt and clear water. We are looking for a specific improvement grant or funding to be made available to raise the road by 200 m to ensure the people of Ballyheigue and other road users can get in and out of the village.

That includes €1.8 billion on regional and local roads. I cannot make a commitment here and now about specific road projects in the Deputy’s constituency or in any other constituency. However, because the economy is doing well, more people are back at work and the public finances are back in order, we are now able to invest in our roads and public transport in the years ahead in the way we were not in the past. That allocation of €4.3 billion over the next four years will allow us to do much important work around the country improving our road network. This will only be possible, however, if we continue to manage the economy well, do not repeat the mistakes of the past, do not engage in profligate spending and do not allow our competitiveness to fall. It is important that all Members on all sides have a bit more regard to that in the future.

It is not fair to ask people to drive through a flood to get into their village.

The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, criticised Jackie Healy-Rae for bringing funding down to Kerry. Let the Minister of State bring down the funding for the N70 between Blackwater Bridge and Sneem. Jackie Healy-Rae brought a lot of money and did a lot to improve sections of these roads. There are a few bits remaining to be done. It is time the Minister of State brought the funding and looked after the people of Kenmare, Sneem, Ardfert and Ballyheigue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	I refer to the commitment to child protection in the programme for Government. Anyone who watched "Prime Time" last night could only have been sickened and appalled by what was allowed to happen in that County Galway foster home. We have become almost numb to the repetition of such cases; the case of Grace last year was mentioned earlier. The Galway case happened relatively recently. On the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy McDonald, I am not as convinced that it is something we can say happened before 2011 and is not going to happen now. There is something systemically wrong with how we deal with child protection. There have been too many cases and they have happened too recently. The Taoiseach referred to the industrial schools of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s and said they were different cases. A review is being undertaken but there is a case for a special commission to establish if our methodologies and models of care correct. Without casting aspersions on individuals we should ask if our models of monitoring, both in foster care and other settings, are appropriate. The bottom line in this case is that there were really credible grounds for removing these children from this care setting but it did not happen. Just because it happened in 2006 does not mean it could not happen now, that is my concern. We are aware of other cases in the pipeline and have raised these in the House. We need to stand back and ask ourselves some hard questions without partisan comment as this has nothing to do with politics, namely, are our systems, methodologies and approach to acting adequate, when alarms are sounded and credible claims are made about children being at risk? Do our systems respond adequately to those alarm bells ringing? We facilitated the panel review but a commission of investigation on this may be necessary or some broader commission under the auspices of Tusla and others, in order to stand back and ask hard questions of whether we are protecting children adequately.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	146	I did not say that I did not think it could happen now nor was that what I meant. I was merely pointing out the enormous changes and improvements that have happened in child protection in the last seven or eight years. That does not mean that there is not more to be done, that children are not at risk or that we do not have further obligations to protect those who are vulnerable or in foster care. An independent investigation is being carried on this case out by the national review panel. We should allow it to proceed to see what lessons can be learned from it and see what changes should be made and measures put in place. It is significant that mandatory reporting, which was promised as long as 20 years ago, has been in place since December. In order to realise it, Tusla has been allocated an additional €40 million for this year to recruit 300 additional staff to deal with the expected increase in referrals, to manage unallocated cases, as we do have cases that have not been allocated to a social worker, and to develop aftercare services, which are particularly important, in order that an aftercare plan is put in place for young adults when they leave care at 18 or 19 years.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	Increasingly, parents across the State, including the Taoiseach's constituency of Dublin West, contact me on the lack of places for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, in ASD units or mainstream classrooms. That experience is common among members of the Sinn Féin group. We have lost count of the number of parents who have contacted our representatives in desperation because they have nowhere to send their child. Waiting lists are long. In some cases, people must travel long distances to access units but in many cases there are no units to access. I am aware of schools that are hesitant about opening an ASD unit, sometimes due to questions of adequate funding. Parents are at their wits' end. A review of the system with a joined-up approach by the Departments of Health and Education and Skills is required to ensure that services are in place to support children and their families. In the case of Dublin West, the Taoiseach's bailiwick, there is increasing demand and a campaign among this substantial cohort of parents for what they call a special school. They are under immense pressure and we need to give them an answer. I raise this issue in respect of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2016, the point being that these children will not have admission to any school or unit because the facilities are not there, the funding is not there or blocks are being put in their way. We need to sort this out. 
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23782	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	I acknowledge that any parent who has a diagnosis of a child with special needs is faced with huge challenges. I understand that. We have appointed an independent adviser to Government, which makes decisions about suitable placements, the National Council for Special Education need, NCSE. On foot of its recommendations, we have more than doubled the number of ASD units from 550 in 2011 to over 1,300. Every year we add 150 to 180 special units. On teaching resources, we have put in 1,600 additional resource teachers in the past two years and 3,000 special needs assistants, SNAs. We are putting in huge investment to support children with special education needs. The decision as to what is the most appropriate placement is decided on the advice of the NCSE. About 60% are in mainstream classes, some 20% are in special units in mainstream schools and about 20% are in special schools. We are dramatically expanding provision in this area and continue to respond to need. We have completed a review and rolled out a new model of providing resource teachers to schools, which is working well. There is universal support for the new model. We have undertaken a review of SNAs, which will shortly come to Government to assess how be might improve it.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	I wish to return to the schools building programme and particularly to the PPP school bundle 5, which I first raised in January. The difficulties caused by the liquidation of Carillion have been compounded somewhat with the de facto construction company, the Sammon Group, going into examinership more recently.Six schools are at stake here. They are located in my own constituency of Wexford, in the towns of Bray and Kells, and two are located in Carlow. There are real difficulties now. When I first raised this issue in January, I was assured that it would be resolved in a matter of weeks. We are now heading towards May and we do not have a resolution. Needless to say, I am regularly in touch with the National Development Finance Agency is respect of these matters. I still do not have a clear horizon on when the completed Loreto secondary school in Wexford will be handed over. It is ready. It had actually gone through a deep clean before formal handover. It is now lying idle. More worryingly, an official in the Department of Education and Skills has indicated to the school that it should prepare contingency plans for the school not being available for the new term in September. In terms of subject choices, the school had intended to expand its range of teachers. That would be impossible. I do not expect the Taoiseach to have a detailed answer to this at his fingertips, but will he take a direct personal interest in ensuring that these completed schools are brought into public use as soon as possible?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23782	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	Deputy Howlin will know the arrangements under public private partnerships, PPPs. The strength and, if one chooses to call it such, the weakness of these arrangements is that the responsibility lies with the contracting party to complete the schools and hand them over. In this case that party is now the Dutch Infrastructure Fund, DIF. The State will not be making payments until that handover has occurred. It is DIF that is undertaking the tender for the completion of those works, not the State. That is as it should be because the State cannot breach the rules of a PPP agreement and hope that the terms will be honoured.

I always do, especially in this section. I want to ask a question in respect of the programme for Government and its commitment to health. There are definitely health issues in Tipperary. The Minister, Deputy Harris, who is actually present, visited Cashel some time ago and was aghast to see an empty hospital on which €25 million had been spent. Over the road, however, there is a sister hospital, St. Patrick's Hospital, which provides for old folks and geriatric care. Within that hospital, there is a wonderful assessment unit to which stroke victims, victims of accidents and so on can be brought for the exceptional care provided by the matron and the staff. On Sunday I visited a good friend of mine, a neighbour. He had been told he was going home, as were all the other patients. I did not think anything of it. I thought they were just fit to go home. They were told yesterday that, because a general practitioner, GP, cannot be acquired, no more patients are being taken into the unit and there are rumours today that it might be closed.

We had an excellent GP in Cashel, Dr. Ryan. He is retiring. What will the Minister do to make sure that hospital can continue to operate and to give solace to the families and patients who are there for necessary care? What will he do to ensure there will be a GP to cover that assessment unit in St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel?

If he wants to furnish me with some details I will certainly talk to the HSE and then revert to him directly on the issue. On the broader issue regarding general practice, the Government has increased the number of training places for GPs. In fact there will be a significant increase on last year beginning this year.

While legislation is going through the Dáil process at present, one reads in the newspapers today of a further row, in which the Minister for Justice and Equality is saying he has the authority to propose the appointment of judges and that there can be no veto on appointments. How does that marry with Article 28.2 of the Constitution, which states that the Government has to work with collective authority, as well as collective responsibility? As a former member of Cabinet, it is my understanding that there is an effective veto. If one is a member of Cabinet one has the power to say "No". Is there a change in the rules, the legislation or the interpretation of the Constitution in respect of the necessity for collective responsibility, authority or agreement on judicial appointments? The current system, in my understanding of the law, means that any Cabinet Minister has the ability to say "No" and to stop an appointment. Has that changed? Will the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and Equality, or both outline the rules under this Government?

Decisions made on appointments such as this are made collectively by the Government. The decision on that particular appointment was made collectively and unanimously by the Government, so there is no need to correct the Cabinet handbook. This is the third time in the past three or four weeks that I have read a story in a newspaper about a Cabinet Minister threatening to resign, but I have yet to have one do so. They all seem to want to hold onto their positions. Perhaps they are afraid that I might say "Yes". This is more fake news I am afraid. This time it was in The Irish Times, it was the Irish Examiner earlier on in the week.

I know it is an ambition of everyone in this Chamber to ensure that each old person is helped to stay in his or her own home as long as possible. However, we do not have enough home help hours for patients or the elderly in our county. At weekends and on Saturdays and Sundays, it is impossible to get cover. There is no cover for bank holidays. When designated home help people go on holidays, as they are entitled to, or get sick themselves, it is now happening that the old people they assist are left without any home help for two weeks at a time. We have a Minister and four Ministers of State in the Department of Health. I ask them to ensure that more home helps are hired in Kerry and that more hours are given to elderly people who wish to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. It will save the country and the State a lot of money if they do so.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I thank the Deputy. I agree with him, as do we all, that building a system which is fit for purpose and which supports people to live longer and better lives in their own homes will save a lot of money in comparison with a system in which they have to be cared for in residential settings. The difficulty at the moment, which I have mentioned on the floor here before, is twofold. It is not a matter of finance, to a point, because €420 million is being spent on home help and 17 million hours are being delivered this year. If one looks at the increase over recent years, the amount we are giving has increased exponentially but we cannot keep up with demand. We also cannot supply the number of home help staff that are required. That is another issue. As Minister of State, I have two choices. I can tinker around the edges and try to patch the system that is there, or I can bring in a complete new system that is fit for purpose and which addresses the issues which the Deputy is talking about, including weekend cover and ensuring sufficient staff for the demand. That is what I intend to do. That is pretty well in progress in my Department.

As teachers play a vital role in the education of children, recruiting and retaining new teachers is vitally important. I have met and communicated with many people starting out as teachers in west Cork over recent months. They are under huge pressure due to the very unfair pay system which is in place which, as they know and we all know, discriminates against teachers starting off. These teachers do not want any more promises. In many cases they are moving abroad to teach in countries that respect them. When does this Government intend to bring in teachers' pay equalisation?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23782	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. One of the first things I did when I entered Government was to sit down with the teachers' unions and negotiate improvements for young teachers. This represented a closing of 75% of the pay gap for young teachers. At present, a young teacher coming straight out of college is recruited at €36,000. I also made it easier for that young teacher to get a permanent position. I recognise there is still an issue that is being raised by the teachers' unions. It also affects many other new entrants into the public service. As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has assessed the cost of this and is undertaking to initiate discussions with the trade unions on this issue of new entrants' pay. I understand that those discussions will start later this week. However, it is important to say that no budgetary provision has been made in this area over and above what was provided for in the recent pay agreement made only a number of months ago. This puts constraints on Government. We are hearing many demands from across the House for more money to be spent, but there is only a limited pool available.

I refer to the lengthy departmental review as to where cardiac cath labs are to be located throughout Ireland. What is the update and progress on this review? Furthermore, the Minister, Deputy Harris, knows that we in the north west are being denied a vital public service and that the Saolta University Health Care Group has submitted a service plan to the HSE for approval. We need the service delivered to Sligo University Hospital as a matter of urgency. I refer also to a mental health unit that is to be provided at Sligo University Hospital. The Minister might comment on that also.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	I thank Deputy McLoughlin for raising these important issues for the people of Sligo and the north west. I am delighted we have been able to deliver on a commitment to extend Sligo University Hospital under the Government's capital plan and Project Ireland 2040 and I look forward to visiting the hospital with the Deputy shortly in this regard. The national cardiac review has commenced. I have asked Professor Philip Nolan, president of NUI Maynooth, to chair it. The review also includes a number of patient representatives picked by the Irish Heart Foundation to ensure the patient's voice is at the very heart of it. They will open a public consultation process in June, which will allow the Deputy's constituents, the people of the north west, and indeed people throughout the country, to have their say in order that we can, just as we have done in respect of cancer services and other services, build world-class cardiac services, which I have no doubt-----

However, a commitment was also given to improve the lives of people with disabilities and to develop a new scheme for mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant. Eight months ago, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, said the policy proposals were at an advanced stage. My question for the Taoiseach is when we will actually see a new grant scheme in operation.

It is intended that the memo to allow the legislation to be prepared will be brought to Cabinet next week or the following week jointly by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath. Obviously, we then need to pass the legislation through these Houses. However, the intention is to do so in order that provision can be made in the Estimates for next year to bring it into effect.

The opposite is the reality for staff at present in CG Power Systems in Cavan town because last Friday one of Cavan town's biggest employers announced the loss of at least 50 jobs, which has left those affected, their families and their communities reeling. If this trend were to continue, it would have a catastrophic impact on Cavan town and our county as a whole. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment today that he, his Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and, obviously, his Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will intervene to protect the remaining 384 jobs and that the Government will put in place the measures that are needed for the staff who will find themselves out on the job market again?

In the past 12 weeks, despite the fact that all the final figures were supposed to be in last year, we now find that the Central Bank has identified 3,400 more tracker mortgage victims. It is very clear that the culture within the banks is not changing and will not change, and we need to recognise that. It is therefore time to introduce serious legislation that will hold individual bankers to account. We have produced some of that legislation. There are two pieces before the committee, that is, class action legislation and another piece which would allow for the jailing of bankers who lie to the Central Bank. My questions to the Taoiseach are if he will allow the money messages to these pieces of legislation so they can proceed, and if he will bring in his own legislation that will see real white-collar crime dealt with in our financial institutions and hold individual bankers to account in respect of their actions.

I have had calls and correspondence from numerous small businesses around Carlow-Kilkenny that are being crippled by 300% and 400% increases in rates. Some of the business owners to whom I have spoken will have to close. Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill in the Dáil previously proposing that the level of increases levelled on an individual business must be capped. Any increase should be allowed to be staggered at the discretion of the local authority over a five-year period. This would mean the increase would be limited and spread over time, as opposed to the current process of a single large increase. There is a clear need for a formal appeal mechanism for businesses to the local authority to restructure debt payments on the basis of ability to pay. A revaluation was carried out in Kilkenny recently. There were increases to small businesses' rates of 300% and 400%. This is impacting businesses. I am told that if there is no staggering, or if local government does not look at it, they will be closed down because they are SMEs-----

It is a terrible situation. The Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, says it has become increasingly frustrated by the tactics of the vulture funds, which are forcing quick farm sales without the agreement of the farmer. The IFA is really saying it no longer has faith that the Government will do anything about this. The IFA has proposed a solution, which is to campaign for people, including auctioneers and advertisers, to boycott these sales and for people to take charge of this situation and to prevent the vulture funds from selling the many farmlands around the country. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that nothing has been done to prevent these vulture funds from carrying on in this manner.

One of the pillars of the Rebuilding Ireland programme is to get new houses built. However, in Mitchelstown we have various planning permissions being approved and granted for new house builds and new estates to be built, but nothing has been able to move in recent years because the Irish Water facilities are not up to standard. In the past week we have had the even more shocking news of Irish Water's announcement that it has rebundled the upgrade to Mitchelstown's wastewater facilities with other new build facilities in east Cork. This is shocking news for people in Mitchelstown to hear.Mitchelstown has the potential to grow. At present-----

What we have in the new housing delivery unit in the Department is a way to co-ordinate to ensure key sites ready to be built upon have the necessary services going into them. It is also an ambition we have under Project Ireland 2040 and one of the new pieces of administration we are putting in will ensure things can be aligned. If the Deputy wants to pass me a detailed note on this I will see where it sits in the actual scheme of Irish Water's priorities over the next three years.

Yesterday, I raised a question on Leaders' Questions and the Taoiseach may have inadvertently misled the Dáil. He said, when I raised the issue of voluntary contributions in schools:Voluntary contributions are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of any compulsion to pay, that in making a contribution they are doing so under their own volition and that they are not under pressure to do so ... This is all outlined in Circular 0065/2010, which clarifies what charges can be requested from parents.I checked the circular. It refers only to former fee-paying secondary schools that have now converted to free education schemes. The circular does not address the bulk of secondary schools and none of the primary schools. For clarity, if the impression was given that there is some rule to prohibit it, there is no such rule and I know the Taoiseach would like to make that clear.

Cabinet committee C supports the Government in its consideration of European Union matters, including the ongoing Brexit negotiations and their implications for Ireland. Given their significance, these matters are also regularly discussed at full meetings of the Cabinet. In addition, I regularly meet Ministers, on an individual basis or in groups, in order to focus on particular issues, including those relating to the EU. In particular, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy McEntee, and I meet senior officials on a regular basis to discuss European affairs and the Brexit negotiations. Preparation for Brexit at official level, both in relation to the negotiations and in preparing for the potential consequences of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, is intensive, with interdepartmental and senior official groups meeting regularly. Preparing for and dealing with Brexit in a way that delivers the best possible outcome for the country remains a top priority for the Government. Cabinet committee C last met on 13 February. The date for the next meeting has not yet been confirmed but it will occur before the June European Council summit.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The Brexit stakeholders forum meets periodically is of very great use and is an important innovation to continue. I want to ask the Taoiseach about what I discern to be a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Tánaiste on the timetabling of critical decisions. The Tánaiste has repeatedly made it clear that June really is critical, in terms of the European Council, for a clear decision to be made on the Irish Border situation. The Taoiseach seems to be giving a view that we actually have until October. Legally, that is correct. However, there is a very strong view across the House that if we do not have a clear decision by June then we will have an awful lot less leverage in October when the final settlement issues are being addressed. I would like clarity on this. What will the Irish Government do if no progress on the Irish Border issue is available and clear by the June Council meeting? The customs union is now the real issue. Obviously, the British Government has lost votes on this matter in the House of Lords. It will face a critical vote after the local elections in Britain in early May. I have said it is important for us to keep as much pressure as we can for the customs union arrangement between the United Kingdom and the European Union to be kept in place because the issues of importance for us are not only North-South in nature, they also have an east-west dimension. I do not want a hard border in the ports of Rosslare or Dublin no more than I want a hard border on the island of Ireland. The UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, was before the Brexit committee of the House of Commons this morning. He answered again, in respect of the Border, that most of the technology exists today to solve all of these issues. Nobody believes that. This is the line, as if there is some technological magical solution for having separate customs arrangements in the North of Ireland and the Republic. I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on this matter.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	Nobody believes Mr. Davis's assertion because it is not true. It is the stuff of "Alice in Wonderland" and I really wish the British would desist from positing these non-starters. It is clearly part of their strategy to play for time in the hope that either Europe or the Government in Dublin will blink and they will get away with pushing the Irish question indefinitely down the pipe. That cannot be allowed to happen. Will the Taoiseach comment on a report in yesterday's edition of The Times in which a document purporting to be an internal EU memo raises very serious questions about the efficacy of the backstop agreement reached last December? As we all know, this backstop represents the absolute minimum requirement in respect of Ireland and if it has flaws or potential flaws then we need to be conversant with them and we need to sort them out. I am concerned that something that was initially described as a cast-iron guarantee moved to a gentleman's agreement and then to a political promise, and now, if this report is right, some are questioning its viability. The Tánaiste is right to say that June is the deadline. That is the red letter time. I would like to hear the Taoiseach reiterate and clarify this matter. I would like him to tell us what he proposes to do to ensure the June deadline does not slip and that we do not allow matters to roll into the summertime and then into the autumn, because that would put us in an impossible position. Not only would our leverage be lessened, we could find ourselves without any leverage at all.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	Before I put my specific question, I want to point out that it is now the Taoiseach's customary practice to completely ignore difficult questions by using up all of his time to answer less challenging ones. Yesterday, I asked very direct and relevant questions on exaggerated claims for the strategic communications unit and the admission of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that he does not understand homelessness figures. However, the Taoiseach did not even reference, let alone answer, those questions. This is a pattern that was repeated in previous sessions. We are used to a Taoiseach trying to avoid hard questions but it is a new approach simply to refuse to engage at all. I hope the Taoiseach will review this particular strategy. With regard to Europe, significant confusion has been caused by the Taoiseach's statement at the European Council that he was okay with the final text concerning a backstop waiting until October. The Tánaiste has been trying to row this back since then and is insisting that any failure to reach a deal in June would be an enormous threat.The informed the BBC that we would even have to question whether we could get a final settlement at all. Can the Taoiseach tell me which position is correct - his, as outlined in Brussels, or that of the Tánaiste? The situation in respect of negotiations is that there has been very little progress on the backstop text for the withdrawal treaty and no progress on a final status deal. In the event of the British Government reversing its position and agreeing to remain in the customs union, has the Government completed any study on the implications for this country of the UK being in the customs union but outside the Single Market? Every possible Irish solution requires regulatory alignment. Equally, no regulatory alignment is possible without working political institutions in Northern Ireland. Are there any backstop plans for how this regulatory alignment would be maintained if the assembly and the Executive remain suspended?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	What, if anything, is the EU saying about the deaths of 41 unarmed Palestinians in recent weeks? These unarmed protestors were shot by Israeli snipers in acts of cold and calculated murder. The latest victims include Tahrir Mahmoud Wahba, a deaf teenager aged 18 who was shot last Friday, and Abdullah Muhammad al-Shamali, another youth who has just died of his wounds. This brings the number of deaths to 41, which is shocking. These people are protesting to vindicate what is a right under international law. Is the Taoiseach saying anything to our European counterparts about what sanctions Europe should take and what pressure it should exert on Israel in respect of these shocking human rights violations against unarmed protesters? Israel has just announced that any member of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, IPSC, who attempts to enter the Israel-Palestine area will not be allowed to do so. Four IPSC activists were deported by Israel recently. There has been no retaliation or action in response by the Government to this treatment of Irish citizens. The EU's position is that illegal settlements are wrong and should happen. People who live in those Israeli settlements can come here very easily while Palestinians who live in Palestinian territory designated for them under international law have more difficulty getting in here. Is that not somewhat bizarre? Why are we not levelling some diplomatic sanction at people living in what are designated illegal settlements in terms of their capacity to enter Europe or this country when one looks at what Israel is doing to our citizens who are just peaceful civil society activists?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	I am sure that, like many people concerned with immigration in Europe, Ireland and the UK, the Taoiseach has been appalled by the story of what happened to members of the Windrush generation who were invited to live and work in the UK from countries like Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean after the Second World War and who have been effectively deprived of most their rights of residency in the UK in the past couple of years. The British Government has now promised to redress this for people from the Caribbean. However, Guy Verhofstadt, who is the European Parliament liaison person for Brexit, has expressed serious concerns on behalf of EU citizens who may be similarly affected by this type of development in UK immigration law, which is very complex and which I do not think anybody fully understands. In terms of the work being done by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach, has the Windrush issue been examined and followed? Has a report on it been prepared? There will be people living in Northern Ireland who have lived in the Republic of Ireland but who originally came from other parts of the EU or the wider world. In the UK, people in their 60s and 70s have been refused cancer treatment by the NHS and other people have been threatened with deportation. Has the Taoiseach had this matter examined as part of the fallout from the changes the UK is making?

I think there are, on average, 26 or 27 questions and I am given two and a half minutes to answer them. The way this session is structured makes it quite impossible to answer all the questions and, very often, those that are asked are not germane to the actual main question. Obviously, I will prioritise ones that relate to the question rather than miscellaneous issues that do not relate to it. I agree that it is a matter for the Business Committee but if it is a day for asking and avoiding hard questions, I would be curious to know if the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Micheál Martin, agrees with the view of one of his Deputies that the Mahon tribunal has been discredited. The Mahon tribunal made a number of serious findings against members of Fianna Fáil who I will not mention in this House because they are not here to defend themselves. I would be very interested to know whether the leader of Fianna Fáil agrees with the view that the Mahon tribunal has been discredited.

However, I am happy to allay the Deputy's fears. The Tánaiste and I are both of the view that there needs to be sufficient and substantial progress made by the time the European Council meeting is held in June. What I will not do is answer hypothetical questions in this House about what we will or will not do if there is insufficient or insubstantial progress by June. In the first instance, it is not in the interests of the Irish people or the State for us to outline our negotiating strategy in a public forum. I hope Members will understand that. Second, that is a decision which must be made there and then, in June, when we have all the facts. It is only the end of the April and a lot can happen between now and the Council meeting in June. It is our very strong view that we need to see sufficient and substantial progress on Irish issues by the time of the June Council meeting. On the remarks by the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, there are many comments from him on many different dates. I have not read the particular comments today but I did see reports that the UK will put forward an alternative text to the Irish protocol to option C. We would certainly welcome seeing that alternative. That is exactly the kind of engagement we would like to see from the UK but we have yet to see an alternative text put forward by it. We would like to see such a thing if it exists. Once again, I reiterate that I am not aware of the existence of the technology that David Davis seems to believe exists. We have always said that there cannot be a technical solution to Irish Border challenge. It requires a political and legal solution and that is what we have been working towards. With regard to the article in yesterday's Irish edition of The Times, I checked with my lead official, who is heading up the negotiations on our behalf - our sherpa. He told me that he did not recognise what was contained in the article. Many people will put across positions in newspapers, both Irish and British-owned, in the coming weeks so we need to take them as they come. In the context of Israel and Palestine, I am not aware of an EU communiqué on the matters raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett but I assure him that we have a robust engagement with the Israeli authorities at political and diplomatic level and have outlined our rejection of the human rights abuses that occur in that particular state on many occasions. My Department has not examined the Windrush issue but we would see it as being a very different matter. Obviously, it relates to immigrants from the Commonwealth who came to the UK prior to 1971. The situation we face is comprehended by the common travel area and is very different.

My Department is responsible for the co-ordination of the annual Easter commemoration ceremony which takes place at the GPO on Easter Sunday. Since the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 2006 the commemoration has taken place annually. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces play a central part in the ceremonies. The detailed logistical elements of the programme are worked out in conjunction with the Office of Public Works events management unit, An Garda Síochána and other State agencies as appropriate.

He said his Department co-ordinates the 1916 commemoration. I think we can all agree that we had a wonderful centenary in 2016, but in a general sense the annual event needs more focus. Will the Taoiseach review the nature of it? I noted that the Taoiseach had Rahm Emanuel as a guest. Is there an official guest list? That might be a good idea and would enhance it. Could we do other things to enhance it? We are in the decade of commemorations; many things happened in this period of time 100 years ago. Monday marked the centenary of the anti-conscription strike in 1918, an event marked by the Labour Party in Wicklow this week. Bray and Wicklow town were two centres of a very successful strike that ended Lloyd George's conscription plans for Ireland and had a momentous impact in saving thousands of lives. With many events that are not on the official list of commemorations, perhaps we could have some dialogue across parties about having a comprehensive list. I would welcome the Taoiseach's views.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	Deputy Howlin has made a good proposal. I have a number of questions on State commemorations generally. In the build up to the centenary of the 1916 Rising, one aspect that worked very well was the all-party consultative group on commemorations. It was first established in 2005 and reconstituted in 2011. It was envisaged that the group would look at a host of events over the course of the decade of significant centenary anniversaries. However, regrettably that committee has become moribund. I understand that the Minister is minded to reconstitute the committee, which is welcome. I also welcome the commitment that this group will look at centenary events to the year 2023 which is beyond 2021 as originally intended. A full examination of the State's role and actions during the Civil War is essential. Regrettably parties have not had an input into a number of significant anniversaries, some which have passed without any State commemoration. The anti-conscription strike mentioned by Deputy Howlin is a case in point of an event that warrants recognition and remembrance. The centenary of the 1918 election is nearly upon us.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	The work carried out by staff at the Department of the Taoiseach is always excellent and ensures they are dignified and focused on unifying elements, such as the institution of the Presidency and of course the Army, which is now, and always has been, the only legitimate Óglaigh na hÉireann. However, it is a great pity the Taoiseach chose to be so highly partisan last week at his party's event concerning the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. It is curious that he thinks we should have a national day to commemorate an Act of the Oireachtas and yet the Government saw no need to mark the 80th anniversary of the first constitution in the world adopted in a democratic referendum. I submitted a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach on his plans, but it was transferred out to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan. It is curious that a constitution that made Ireland a republic should be ignored in favour of an Act that added it as a descriptor, which is used only in some circumstances. My party welcomes the idea of having consultations about whether more events should be commemorated. However, the focus needs to be on ensuring that these are constructive non-partisan discussions. When does the Taoiseach intend following up on his speech? Does he accept in retrospect that the failure to mark last year's anniversary of our republican Constitution set a very bad precedent?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	Since all the different strands of Irish politics are throwing in their particular slant on the revolutionary period, I will throw in something of importance. During the whole social revolution that took place in the 1916-21 period, it is a little known fact - the Taoiseach might be horrified at this - that 200 soviets were set up in Ireland between 1918 and 1921.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	Some, at least, who were fighting in the revolution were not just looking to change the colour of the flag, but actually saw themselves as part of a wider international revolt against a system that put profit before people. Famously in the creamery in Charleville they put up a banner when they took it over saying "We make butter not profits", which was pretty brilliant. That was another dimension of the revolutionary period.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	What happened to Charleville?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	Indeed. That needs to be commemorated and remembered. The Limerick Soviet, for example, was an extraordinary event over six weeks. Workers took over, printed their own currency and saw themselves as aligned with a big international movement. It was not just a parochial event, but part of a big international thing. The commemorations need to acknowledge the different strands of the revolutionary movement in this country.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	I wish to bring one other item to the Taoiseach's attention on which I believe there would be broad agreement even from the previous speaker. The year 1919 saw the publication of the Democratic Programme. The author and inspiration for much of it was the leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson, who succeeded Connolly. The point is that the Democratic Programme is the basis of the agreement about social democracy in Ireland in the sense of provision of social welfare, universal education and universal access to health care. It is something that politically still lives very much in Ireland. Obviously there will be a Labour Party celebration of it, but I would like to have an all-party Dáil celebration of Tom Johnson's legacy.

I appreciate that Deputies have taken the opportunity to raise matters other than the annual 1916 commemoration. When that is done, it will not be possible for me to answer all questions.I will have to prioritise those that relate to the questions submitted. The cross-party dialogue is very fitting and appropriate when it comes to these matters. One of the successes of the decade of commemorations has been the fact that it has operated largely on a cross-party basis and everyone has been able to buy in to, and participate in, the commemorations and not feel they belong to one particular party. That is very much the vein in which the Government intends to continue.  The event I participated in last week to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the Republic was a party event. Other parties have their events. Labour and Sinn Féin have their events. I imagine People Before Profit has its events too. I hope it did not upset Deputy Martin that Fine Gael might have an event-----

In the years to 2023, with the various historical events falling to be remembered, such input will again be beneficial in informing the State commemorative programme for the remainder of the decade of centenaries. Last September the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle requesting that the Business Committee nominate Deputies and Senators to the group. Parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly that are not represented in the Dáil or Seanad were also asked to make nominations. Some nominations from the Dáil, Seanad and Northern Ireland Assembly remain outstanding. The current Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, expects most of these to reach her shortly. The Minister will then be in a position to convene an early meeting of the group. It is noteworthy also that the public consultations process to assist the expert advisory group on commemorations in framing its advice to Government has recently concluded. The consultation covers the period 1918-23, which led to the foundation of the State, the War of Independence and the Civil War, and sought views on how the State might meaningfully and appropriately commemorate centenaries of the related significant historical events. The advice of the group is expected shortly and may help inform the discussions of the all-party group when convened.  There is also an expert advisory group, which was established by former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2011 and meets regularly in the Department of the Taoiseach. Its role is to advise the Government on historical matters relating to the decade of centenaries and to consult widely with academic, community and voluntary groups and members of the public to ensure that significant events are commemorated accurately, proportionately and appropriately in tone. The group is non-partisan and is composed of independent members, mainly academics, from around the country with Dr. Maurice Manning acting as chair of the group.  In regard to soviets, as Deputy Boyd Barrett may know, one of the more interesting ones historically was the Arigna soviet, where the red flag was raised over the mine. If anyone has not visited the Arigna visitors' centre I would encourage them to do so. I do, however, see something interesting in the slogan "we make butter not profit" because the most sustainable way for an industry to survive would be to make both butter and profit.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together. The actions contained in the Mulvey report for the social and economic regeneration of the north east inner city are being overseen and implemented by the programme implementation board, which meets on a monthly basis. It is chaired by Michael Stone and comprises representatives from the community and business sectors and the key Departments and agencies. My Department remains actively involved with the work of the board and the local programme office. The chair of the board reports on a regular basis to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. This group ensures continued strong and active participation by all the relevant Departments and agencies, and deals with any structural barriers or issues highlighted by the board.  The board is working hard in several areas to ensure we achieve the desired change. During my recent visit to the area I witnessed at first hand the commitment of a wide range of community projects working hard to develop opportunities for the people of the north-east inner city.  I also launched the north-east inner city 2017 progress report when I visited the area with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on Monday, 26 February. A very positive start has been achieved since June 2017, with solid structures and initial funding measures put in place. The focus now shifts to making the fundamental changes required to transform the area over the long term. Community safety and local jobs are two critical areas. The assignment of 40 new gardaí to the area earlier this month is a major breakthrough and a positive platform from which to deliver a strong and visible community policing service. The impact of drug addiction is fundamental to the challenges facing the community and is an issue which has been raised by various Deputies.  There is a new national drugs strategy with refreshed priorities and the board is working closely with the local drugs and alcohol task force. The first area of collaboration is on a drugs-related intimidation seminar to be held in Croke Park in late May to bring forward practical solutions to tackle this real problem.  The board continues to work with local employers to maximise employment opportunities for local people. The big win so far has been through the new local construction skills and work experience course, which has been run several times and has delivered about 50 jobs. The board is trying to build on that model and target other areas of high demand. The bigger companies are beginning to come forward with individual job offers and are continuing to engage well on structured work experience programmes in the area, such as CareerLEAP.  Thirty new jobs targeting childcare, youth work and care of the elderly services in the community have recently been advertised. These are being funded under the new pilot social employment fund for the area.  The board is working closely with Dublin City Council to drive forward the programme of works to help improve the look and feel of the area.  The Government will continue to support Michael Stone and the board in this work, which is seeing good collaboration between State services, community projects and local employers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	One of the most striking aspects of the report of the task force is that it involves very little more than the type of planning which was typical before the Government effectively closed down local development efforts in 2011 and 2012. When we meet community groups in the area, as I have, and I again visited there recently, we see there is a need to develop a new national commitment to partnership-based community development. The original drug task forces had a huge impact on many areas. That was not primarily a question of money, although it did involve additional funding. It was a question of whether there was a way to get all the State agencies working together in an integrated manner and positively discriminating in favour of such areas. Past initiatives did have a significant impact, when we consider school completion data or the numbers attending courses for early school leavers and at-risk youth. A community-based approach had a huge and very positive impact on many parts of the city of Dublin. I am concerned by the fact that responsibility for early school leaving is with Tusla. It should not be there. That happened because of trying to beef up Tusla when the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established. The same applies to the National Educational Welfare Board, which is out of the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. Both are integral to education. We need to go back to community-based service planning. When I was in the north-east inner city a month ago I saw that housing is a very big issue which this task force is not dealing with. There is a concern that there is an unwritten, almost unspoken, policy of trying to change the profile of who resides in these areas. The quality of local housing stock is shocking. I cannot see why there is not a proper, specific housing strategy for this area to provide new local authority houses but also facilitate the refurbishment of the existing stock, which is in a very bad way. It cannot all be about student accommodation and catering for employees who are coming in transiently. The local, as it were, native population must be looked after.

I am not overstating things. I represent the area and know it very well. I am not overstating matters when I say that very many people in the inner city, in the old flats complexes, are living in conditions that are not fit for human habitation; they are slum conditions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	284	Shocking.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	These are the finest of people and the finest of families and it is no reflection on them. They live in flats in which there is no room for a kitchen table or a dining-room table where a child would do his or her obair bhaile or where a family can eat a meal together. It is astonishing. In fact, when Kieran Mulvey was doing the groundwork for what would subsequently be his report, he stated very openly that he was shocked by the conditions in which people were living. This is not a superficial issue. It is not simply a matter of refurbishment, it one of root-and-branch, deep social regeneration. Housing is a big part of that but it is not addressed in this strategy and that is a mistake. It makes a mockery of the objectives of the whole exercise. There would be no harm in having a seminar on drugs-related intimidation. However, we do not need another seminar. What we actually need is a dedicated resource in the area to deal with these issues. We have held seminars before. The Taoiseach talked on his visit about additional funding for the development of a pilot social employment scheme for the area. Can we have more details on that? Who will it target and for whom will it cater? Who are the scheme's partners from within the community?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	People who pass the junction of Gardiner Street and Sean McDermott Street and see the magnificent new student accommodation that was built in under two years will find it hard to believe. I could refer to 12 other locations throughout the city where the same is happening. However, I want to ask the Taoiseach why so little progress is being made in respect of taking on young men and women as apprentices and trainees. I have the height of respect for Michael Stone, the chairman of the task force. He has great experience in employing apprentices and a great track record. He is known to people for that. In the context of the Taoiseach's office and its responsibility in the area of oversight, what is causing progress to be so slow? Very shortly, we will not have workers to build houses because we do not have apprentices. On the figures that the Minister for Education and Skills issued recently in respect of the additional carpenters entering training, can the Taoiseach guess what the figure is for the whole of Ireland? It is approximately 1,100. That is a joke. I know the Taoiseach's background is very much a professional one but people get great careers and businesses out of taking the apprenticeship route. I cannot understand why the task force is not concentrating on this, with the support of the Taoiseach's Department. It will be necessary to put some kind of a rocket under the people who are organising apprenticeships in order that the kids in the area in question, including all the girls who are showing great interest in becoming electricians, get apprenticeships. The demand is there. People like Joe Costello, my former colleague in the north inner city, will tell the Taoiseach that because he has decades of experience of working particularly in education and training in the north inner city.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	This is a broad canvas. Quite frankly, an awful lot of good has been done. I want to acknowledge that and the initiatives taken by the Taoiseach's predecessor. There is some transformative work being done. I just want to concentrate on one little aspect of that broad canvas, namely, the area of the national drugs strategy and its implications. I do not think we can actually tackle the really menacing, pervasive, destructive issue of drugs in the context of a tiny area. I spent an evening last week in north-west Dublin at one of the biggest youth clubs in the country. It was highlighted to me that the increased Garda presence in the inner city is actually dislodging some pushers out of the latter and into the area to which I refer. We need to have a joined-up approach in respect of the drugs strategy. I ask the Taoiseach to also focus on a second issue. There is an enormous amount of groundbreaking, important community work being done in the north inner city and across the State. This needs to be funded in a predictable manner in order that people can make plans on a multi-annual basis. I ask that we collectively decide that this sort of community support not only works but is critical and that we provide whatever resources are needed to support community work and community intervention to ensure that all our citizens get a fair shot.

The local drugs task forces, for example, are funded by Government. We also have the reform of the area partnerships. I was very pleased last week to be able to officiate at the relaunch of the Blanchardstown area partnership, the community development partnership that covers my own constituency but now has expanded its remit to cover all of Fingal. It has been renamed Empower in recognition of that fact and it works, of course, in conjunction with the Fingal Leader Partnership and other groups with which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Alan Farrell, will be familiar. My general sense, and this is just my opinion, is that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the right vehicle for school completion and is getting good results. I am not sure if I agree that something of that nature should be managed on a community development basis. Probably the best way to examine that is to look at school completion rates and see if they have improved since Tusla took over that role.

If, however, we believe in evidence-based policy, probably the best thing for us to do would be to examine those figures. In terms of student accommodation, I believe that the growth of student accommodation across this city and other cities is very welcome. It brings young people into the area and brings greater diversity into different parts of the city and also frees up accommodation for others. Accommodation that would otherwise be used by people in the private rented market now becomes available. It is welcome that offices and businesses are moving into the north-east inner city area as well. I very much welcome the work that Dublin Port is doing to integrate itself with the north-east inner city. I had the pleasure to visit the port on Friday last and to witness again some of the work that Dublin Port Company is doing to integrate its activities with the surrounding community, which, I think, is very welcome. I want to applaud the company for that. Of course, none of this is being done to the exclusion of new social housing or the refurbishment of existing social housing. There are a number of projects under way in that regard. When it comes to apprenticeships, I do not have the figures in front of me although I did a couple of days ago. There has been a very significant increase in the number of apprentices in recent years, in the last year or so, and it is very much on an upward trend and will increase into the future as well. Under the leadership of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, there has been a modernisation of apprenticeships, with new, different types of apprenticeships being added to the more traditional types. I think that is very welcome and it is further evidence that the Government is very supportive of apprenticeships as an educational and career option for young men and women. I would say that over the past two years we have seen a sea change in Government policy towards apprenticeships. When the Labour Party controlled that Department, the number of apprenticeships was going down and there was not really any innovation or any new apprenticeships brought in-----

#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	I wish to discuss the implementation of regulation of community-based mental health care services. Last week the Mental Health Commission, MHC, published reports on 24-hour nurse supervised residences after inspecting 43 of these units. This is the first publication of inspection reports in this area. It is part of a three-year programme that will see the inspection of all 24-hour residences. The findings were both illuminating and disturbing. The Mental Health Commission found serious deficiencies in many of the residences. Residents were not free to leave in six residences, which had locked doors. There was no access to a kitchen to make tea, coffee or snacks in 19 residences. Residents were unable to lock their bedroom doors in 33 residences. More than half - 25 residences - had more than ten beds although ten is the maximum number of beds recommended in A Vision for Change. Only 19 of the 43 residences were in good physical condition. Eight required urgent maintenance and refurbishment. Only 25 residences offered all residents single-room accommodation. Furthermore, two residences had bedrooms which catered for four people. In residences with shared rooms, 58% had no privacy between beds or within the bedrooms. A rehabilitation team provided services for only 51% of these residences. There is no reason to believe that the residences not yet inspected are any better. Dr. Susan Finnerty, inspector of mental health services, was clear in her unease at the findings, saying that it is concerning that some of our most vulnerable citizens, many of whom have spent decades in psychiatric hospitals, are now being accommodated in unregulated, poorly maintained residences that are too big, are institutionalised, restrictive and are not respectful of the privacy, dignity and autonomy of residents. The chairman of the Mental Health Commission, Mr. John Saunders, stated that ideally, there should be a care pathway where people move from hospital to highly supported accommodation, graduating to more independent settings as they gain skills and confidence. However, at present there is a serious lack of suitable accommodation options and rehabilitation and recovery staff to enable service users to move through the different stages of recovery and progress towards the goal of independent, community-based living. Many people have to remain in highly supported accommodation.  The Mental Health Commission justifiably used very strong language in its conclusion. It highlighted how a lack of regulation means people in 24-hour residences are at risk of abuse and substandard living conditions and treatment. Does the Minister of State agree with the findings of the report and its conclusions, and how does he intend on acting on the issues raised in the report? 
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which has come under the spotlight again recently. I appreciate the opportunity to address some of the concerns that were raised as a result of this issue being highlighted recently. Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the Mental Health Commission has the power to inspect, regulate and enforce standards in all approved centres. Approved centres are hospitals or other inpatient facilities for the care and treatment of people experiencing a mental illness or mental disorder and which are registered with the Mental Health Commission. Such inspections are carried out annually. The commission also has the power to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being delivered under the direction of a consultant psychiatrist. There is no requirement to carry out such inspections in a particular timeframe and currently, the commission does not by law have the power to enforce its recommendations.  Last week, as the Deputy noted, the Mental Health Commission published inspection reports into 43 of the country’s 24-hour nurse supervised residences for persons with mental illness. The commission highlighted some concerns it has regarding some of these residences. The commission has called on the Government to introduce legislation to provide the commission with the powers to regulate and inspect these residences. The Mental Health Commission fulfils a very important role in ensuring our mental health services are of a high standard. The Government agrees with the commission that all mental health residences should be subject to regulated inspection. The expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001, which was published in 2015, recommends extending the existing regulation and inspection powers of the commission to such residences at regular periods. My officials are working on a comprehensive set of amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 at present and this important recommendation will be included in the heads of a Bill, which I expect to be significantly advanced by the end of the year. I accept the importance of advancing this work as quickly as possible. It is a comprehensive legislative undertaking, which must now also take account of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which was enacted after completion of the expert group report. Once the draft general scheme of the Bill has been prepared, my officials will undertake consultations with the Mental Health Commission on refining the draft text. Once the general scheme is completed, it will be forwarded to Government for approval before publication. In the meantime, it is important to point out that while the commission cannot enforce the findings of the reports issued last week, service providers must take account of the concerns raised.  In conclusion, I can reaffirm to the Deputy that my Department is taking due account of the recommendations laid out in the report of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 and is progressing these amendments to the Act as quickly as possible. These and other changes, when included in revised mental health legislation, will further improve the protections available to vulnerable people who need care and treatment, ensuring that they can avail of mental health services in the most appropriate environment. 
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	The Mental Health Commission has consistently called for the regulation of 24-hour supervised residences to protect vulnerable people and has called on the Government to take action in this regard. The report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was published in 2015. It made 165 key recommendations to make mental health laws fit for purpose. It is now three years since it was published. We have had three Ministers with responsibility for mental health in that time and three years of broken promises from those Ministers to the effect that these recommendations would be implemented. Alarmingly, only one of these recommendations has been implemented. We do not even have a draft Bill addressing the other recommendations. Two of these recommendations, Nos. 124 and 125, specifically recommend giving the Mental Health Commission the powers it seeks in its report to empower it to take action to ensure people in 24-hour residences are at risk of abuse and substandard living conditions. Most people were shocked at the content of the report but were equally disturbed to learn that the Mental Health Commission does not have these basic powers to protect vulnerable people availing of mental health services. I have raised this issue before but there seems to have been little progress since. When is the Government going to act on these specific recommendations to empower the Mental Health Commission to protect these vulnerable people under the care of mental health services? Is the Minister of State engaging at all stages of the implementation of these recommendations with the relevant stakeholders. In particular, is he fully engaged with the Mental Health Commission and keeping it aware and updated on any steps being taken? I listened to the comment about engaging with the Mental Health Commission on refining the draft text. It would be far more important and relevant to engage with the Mental Health Commission at this stage of the drafting of the text, rather than refining it later. Ultimately, if the recommendations are to be implemented and the powers given to the Mental Health Commission, it has to be engaged at the early stage of the drafting and not just come in at the end when the Bill has been drafted. At that stage it might be sent back to stage one again if it is not fit for purpose. The Mental Health Commission is the key stakeholder on this issue. It will be implementing the recommendations and must be involved from the very start of this process. 
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I share the Deputy's concerns. Politicians on all sides of the House are anxious to try and bring about a situation where the Mental Health Commission will have its powers enhanced. It is free to make inspections and we expect that recommendations made by the Mental Health Commission on foot of any visit to any facility with 24-hour care of some of our most vulnerable patients would be implemented and adhered to. That is a realistic expectation and I believe it will be delivered on. One recommendation of the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was that all high, medium and low-support hostels, crisis, respite houses and other residential services, such as day hospitals, day centres and other facilities, in which mental health services are provided would be registered, and to introduce inspection on a phased basis. It was also recommended that the standard should be made by way of regulation, and that regulation should be underpinned by way of primary legislation. The Deputy has commented on the slow pace of the process, but he will appreciate that it is a huge amount of work to enforce all 165 recommendations, most of which require legislative changes to the Mental Health Act 2001, which is a substantive body of work. The challenge is to do that all in one go rather than tampering with the Act on a bit-by-bit basis. The preference is that we would make the changes required in one item of legislation, and that is why it is taking a bit longer. Patience is required on this particular endeavour but I assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the progress of the officials in the Department and ensure that priority is afforded to publishing the heads of that Bill before the end of the year. 
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	I welcome the Minister. I have brought this issue of the closure of the social protection office in Dunleer to the floor of the Chamber in order to seek definitive information in respect of the future of the Dunleer clinic. We have heard the words "no ambiguity" and "no misinformation" and, in that context, I want to put forward my understanding of the situation and ask the Minister to respond. I and other Deputies received correspondence on 26 March from the Intreo office in Drogheda indicating to us, as a matter of courtesy, that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection wished to advise that, due to accommodation issues, the Dunleer community welfare service clinic would cease with immediate effect. I understood from the letter what the problems were, I inquired about them, and I have to accept and respect there had been difficulties with regard to health and safety in what is a HSE office, in addition to the need for it to be refurbished. The information that was relayed to us in the letter was that the community welfare officer "will be available to carry out a home visit", and that this element of the service was always available and would continue to be. The letter stated that the community welfare officer would be available and flexible in the event of an emergency and that customers would be facilitated. The letter further stated that, to ensure a smooth transition, the Department was communicating with all customers concerned regarding the operational changes and that there would be no changes to current payment arrangements. Everybody accepted that in good faith. The issue is that the HSE is of the opinion that it needs an outreach service there, despite the fact it has an excellent facility at Clogherhead and plans for the expansion of the facility at Castlebellingham, although that is not the Minister's brief. I am reliably informed that for a small investment between the HSE and the Department, the existing building that has a problem could be turned into a proper one-stop shop or, if that is not possible, other issues could be explored. The reality is that the people of Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee have this type of office facility. I am sure the Minister will point out, as she indicated in her response to me yesterday, that there were only five people availing of this service and the numbers were small. That is fine for a snapshot in time. However, I am informed that due to the seasonality of work and other issues particular to the mid-Louth area, that figure could swell to 15 or 20. While I respect the view of the Minister and the Department in regard to providing outreach services and constant contact, we all know that when a service is minimised or closed, the commitment to that service wanes over time. I firmly believe there is a strong need for the provision of an office in Dunleer. My main reason for raising the issue is that I want no ambiguity and I want nobody to be misinformed. I have the transcript of what the Minister said on this issue and I will read it out in my response if she does not adequately answer the question, given she indicated this was a temporary arrangement.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	-----I would advise him to be exceptionally careful. That is all I will say to him at first. This is the fourth time we are having this conversation. To put it on the record of the House, just in case the Deputy missed it the three other times we have had the conversation, my Department operated an outreach community welfare service clinic from the HSE premises in Dunleer every Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon. On average, there are seven customers who look for those services in that area. The condition of the premises was very poor and the HSE withdrew its staff last year. Thereafter, the community welfare service was the only public service delivered from the centre. On 21 March this year the HSE informed the Department that the condition of the building had rapidly deteriorated and now posed a serious health and safety risk to customers and staff. Local management had no option but to suspend the outreach service immediately. As the Deputy will be well aware, given my parliamentary question response to him on Wednesday of last week and in correspondence sent to him by my office on 26 March, my Department has taken immediate steps to minimise any inconvenience to customers who after all are the people at the centre of the service we deliver. Other social protection services, such as jobseeker payments, are dealt with by the Drogheda Intreo centre and the Ardee branch office. Notices were posted directing the seven customers to the Drogheda Intreo centre, which is 15 km away on a main bus route. The community welfare service there is available on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week, and from Ardee health centre on Tuesday and Friday, so it is a good complement for people who require the services of those centres. Customers have also been provided with a phone service staffed by experienced community welfare service personnel in Drogheda and Ardee. The phone service is available to our seven clients every day, while the clinic is only open for two hours on a Wednesday morning. If a customer is unable to visit either of the centres, for example, due to illness, arrangements can be and have been made by Department staff to conduct a home visit. The Department is closely monitoring the impact of the closure. While it is early days, the new arrangements appear to be working quite well. Feedback on the telephone service has been overwhelmingly positive from customers, if not from local Deputies, which is good to hear. I will repeat for the third time to the Deputy that the majority of queries have been resolved over the phone and most customers have been very happy to have avoided otherwise unnecessary visits to the old clinic in Dunleer. For example, on 28 March, of the six calls received, four were for information purposes, with only two customers requiring a meeting with the designated person; on 4 April, of the six calls received, five were for information purposes and one was for a meeting; during the week ending 13 April, seven calls were received, six of which were for information purposes and one from a person who required a meeting; during the week ending 20 April, 12 calls were received, of which ten were for general information purposes and two required a meeting with the Department, and both people attended the Ardee community welfare service on that occasion. The HSE does not intend to renovate the premises in Dunleer but my Department is currently examining the feasibility of providing the community welfare service from alternative premises in Dunleer, as I originally stated to the Deputy in the letter I sent to him by post on 26 March. Following representations from local public representatives, including Deputies Fergus O'Dowd and Peter Fitzpatrick, I and my Department received an offer to host the community welfare service in a local community hall. An architect from the OPW has visited the premises to ascertain its suitability to deliver a public service and the measures that would need to be put in place to facilitate this, as well as indicative timelines and associated cost. Local management is also exploring other options to enhance the provision of the community welfare service across the county. In the meantime, any of the seven existing customers and any people who may in future require the service in the area should contact the dedicated phone lines at 041-9815278 or 086-7953253. I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy without any ambiguity.

I am using that tone because there is frustration out there in regard to the massaging of closures, not just in this instance but, as I noted earlier, in regard to the closure of other offices, with the suggestion that this is due to shortage of staff. The reality is that I and other Deputies sought clarification from the Minister. The Minister told me to be careful so I will read the transcript of her remarks. I am delighted she said she is looking at alternatives because that is not what she told me in the Dáil yesterday and not what she indicated in her conversations, nor is it what was indicated in the Department's conversations and Intreo's conversations with the Deputies in regard to what was happening. On LMFM, the Minister said:The service hasn't been closed down. We were in a position where we were operating our weekly community welfare service to the people in the Dunleer office in a HSE-owned building and we received notification from the HSE that the building was no longer fit for purpose and we couldn't use it any more. The service will continue. There is a very small number of people accessing the service and they are being redirected temporarily to their nearest local office. If they are not in a position to go to that local office, and some people are not, our community welfare staff will go out to them and we will continue to provide the service until we find another, more suitable premises.That was the clarification I sought. I sought it again yesterday, and I am delighted that the Minister has indicated what she is doing. It gives clarity to the people with whom she has been miscommunicating, namely, the Deputies. The information that was communicated to all the Deputies in Louth by Intreo, not by the Minister, told us that the facilities were not being continued. The people in mid-Louth will be delighted with the Minister's response.

In the first instance, he tried to claim that I am misleading people; and now he is saying that it is not me but the Intreo staff.

The services were never closed. The office was not fit for staff to work in and it had to be closed down, but the service continues. Moreover, that was on a temporary basis. We have no intention of closing down the service. The insinuation at the beginning of Deputy Breathnach's second speech-----

I ask him to take that off the record of this House, because he has absolutely no basis in fact to make that statement. We were exceptionally clear when we made our first statement. We were removed from this building only because it was not safe to be in, either for the clients or my staff. We told Deputy Breathnach at the time that we would continue the service for the seven clients, which we have done. I have detailed to Deputy Breathnach exactly what has happened week-on-week. We told the Deputy at the time that we would start to look for alternative premises, which is exactly what we did do and are doing. I am really not sure what part of that is not clear, but I do not expect Deputy Breathnach, an elected representative from the constituency of Louth, to make erroneous allegations just so that he can put this exchange on Facebook for his constituents. He is better than that. He really is.

I was told that was not possible, but if I tabled a Topical Issue matter, the issue would be heard. However, there is no sign of the Minister with responsibility for this area. That is an absolute disgrace. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, should be here to hear the concerns of the three Sinn Féin Deputies on this issue. For whatever reason, he has not bothered to turn up. If we was not in a position to be here, we should have been informed, which is the rule under Standing Orders. I want to protest in the strongest possible terms, given the gravity of these issues, that the Minister is not here. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State who is sitting across from me. Yesterday, when I raised this issue following a leaked report from European officials which cast doubt on the viability of the backstop arrangement agreed last December, I got a very flippant response from the Taoiseach. He said that it was just a leaked report. That is the case, but it still a report, and it still raises serious doubt. Back in December, the backstop arrangement was called a "cast-iron guarantee". It quickly went from cast iron to a political agreement and then to a gentleman's agreement. When the European Union published what it saw as a legal text that would translate the political agreement into an actual protocol, it was dismissed out of hand by the British Government. Then we had the draft withdrawal agreement, huge swathes of which have not been delivered. I was not looking for a response from the Minister of State across from me, but rather one from the Minister with responsibility for this issue, who is in constant contact with European officials. I wanted him to update this House and he is not in a position to do so. I think that is bad faith on behalf of the Minister. My party has given full support to the Government on Brexit so that we can get the best possible result for Ireland. We need information to be given and if the Minister is not in a position to attend to give us that information, it is bad faith on his behalf.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	I live in a Border county. My constituency stretches from Belturbet in County Cavan right around to Pettigo in County Donegal and it takes up almost a third of the Border. It is ironic that today, Mrs. Theresa Villiers, MP, is introducing a Bill in the House of Commons to prevent live imports from outside the UK after Brexit. If a person from County Leitrim or County Cavan bought a couple of sheep in Fermanagh, they would not be able to bring them back across the Border. Trade that has gone on for centuries will be halted in these circumstances. It is a reflection of the concern that all of us have about where the Tory Government is in regard to all of this issue. On the one hand, they talk the talk but, on the other, the reality is that most people who live in Border areas are very fearful that there is going to be a border. We often hear about soft borders. We do not care if it is soft or hard; we do not want a border. That is the result we need. As my colleague has said, we have been forthcoming with assistance to the Minister and the Government in every way possible so that we can get solutions. We need to get a response. We need to understand what is happening, and we expect to get decent communication. In this instance particularly, there needs to be a clear communication from the Irish Government to Mrs. Theresa Villiers, MP, and the Tory party that it is totally outrageous for her to suggest a ban on the export of live animals on the island of Ireland, which would be the outcome.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	We are coming to a crunch time on Brexit. The back stop does not have legal standing, and nor did it. It was a statement. I wish to raise the issue of energy, which is of major concern. We are dependent on Norway and Britain for much of our gas, with a pipeline coming through Britain. Some 40% of our electricity is generated from gas, and if this line is cut or tariffs are put on it, there would be huge implications. We have very little energy security as a result. The east-west interconnector connecting to Britain is another issue. That must be tied down. I am not sure that this has been getting enough attention. The single electricity market for the whole of Ireland, which was due to go live next month, is now delayed until October. What is the future of that project? That is of major concern. It is supposed to save consumers and businesses €200 million. What is the future of the overall all-Ireland electricity market, which has been there for a decade, if this goes ahead?  Regarding oil reserves, the State has oil in storage facilities in Britain. We also have oil stored in one facility in the North. Do we have a replacement for those stocks in the event of a hard border? I do not want to see any border.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I apologise for the Tánaiste. As the Deputies may be aware, he is in Derry today, meeting community politicians and business leaders in relation to Northern Ireland, the peace process, events in Derry and Brexit. The Tánaiste is certainly working hard on the Brexit situation and to ensure that the institutions in Northern Ireland can get back on track again. I thank the three Deputies for raising this issue. I assure Deputy Kenny that both the Irish embassies in London and Brussels, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, all Government Departments and the Taoiseach are monitoring the situation in the UK and Brussels very closely. It is not as if we are not dealing with these issues. We are doing so.  Regarding the Topical Issue itself, the EU's position is quite clear on this. The backstop solution, as proposed in the draft protocol in Ireland and Northern Ireland, is fully workable. It aims to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and to protect both North-South co-operation and the integrity of the customs union and the Single Market. Some progress has been made on the draft protocol in the negotiations that immediately proceeded the European Council meeting in March. This was recorded in an annotated, colour-coded version of the draft withdrawal agreement published by the European Commission task force on 19 March. This reflects the agreement on some articles of the draft text, including the common travel area and other areas of North-South co-operation. During the negotiations, the United Kingdom also accepted that a legally-operative version of the backstop for the Border will be included in the withdrawal agreement in line with paragraph 49 of the joint progress report agreed last December and that all the issues identified in the draft protocol reflect those that must be addressed. These were important steps forward. Since the March European Council, intensive negotiations have been continuing between the EU and UK teams with a view to narrowing the remaining gaps in respect of the draft protocol and other withdrawal issues. Irish officials have been involved in some of these meetings where the task force believes this would be helpful. We will continue to work closely with the task force. The European Council is continuing to follow the negotiations closely and will return at its next meeting in June to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and the framework for the future relationship. The European Union has also made clear that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken are respected in full. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has met several of his EU counterparts in recent weeks and received a strong message of their commitment to this principle and their continuing solidarity with Ireland. The Tánaiste will also make clear the position of the Government and the European Union to Mr. David Lidington when he meets him tomorrow. I am delighted that the European Union's chief negotiator on Brexit, Mr. Michel Barnier, will visit Ireland next week. This is a further indication of the commitment of Mr. Barnier and his team to taking account of Ireland's concerns. Mr. Barnier will meet the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and engage with a wide range of stakeholders at the all-island civic dialogue in Dundalk. The EU has been clear that there must be significant progress on agreeing the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland by June and that the backstop on avoiding a hard border set out in the protocol is a legally workable solution. To respond to the specific query raised by the Deputies concerning the leak of the so-called EU memorandum, I have no intention of commenting on press articles based on leaks. I assure the House, however, that the so-called memo or note alluded to is not a European Commission document, nor does it reflect the position of the European Union in any way. We cannot comment on every newspaper article. Our focus is on Brexit and on ensuring we secure the best solution for Ireland.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	While I do not have any difficulty with the Tánaiste carrying out business in the North, when a Deputy requests statements and is asked to submit a Topical Issue instead, he or she expects the Minister to be available. We could have had this discussion with the Minister tomorrow or next week. Notwithstanding that, the Minister of State is correct that the backstop is workable. Sinn Féin called for special status for the North in order to keep it in the customs union and the Single Market and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. It is important that the Government does not overstate or hype the position set out by the British Government. The British Prime Minister stated that the legal text produced by the European Union is out as no British Prime Minister could sign up to it because it would mean a border in the Irish Sea. The agreement also states that the goods covered by full alignment will be listed, which means some good will not be covered, for example, all services. Only areas connected with North-South co-operation and those that fall under the Good Friday Agreement will be covered by full alignment. The goods and services that will not be covered must be subject to checks, which will mean a hardening of the Border. A backstop is the bare minimum required and, even at that, it will create difficulties. Despite this, there is still no agreement on it. With respect, the British Prime Minister stated that "a" protocol, as opposed to "the" protocol, would be agreed. As the Minister of State knows, there is a significant difference between the words "the" and "a".
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	Sinn Féin appreciates the that Government is doing its best in its dealings with the Tory Government in the UK. My party had the same experience and we understand how difficult it can be to deal with a Tory Government. What is needed is a flow of information and the application of maximum pressure in the interests of Irish citizens, both those living on this island and the millions living in Britain. The Minister of State may have attended the presentation on Irish passports in the audiovisual room earlier. We are conscious of the large numbers of people applying for passports because ordinary citizens are fearful of the potential consequences of Brexit. The Government has a job to do and we must raise the bar in this regard in order to reassure people that their rights will be protected. We spoke about the issue of agriculture and cross-Border trade. We must also bear in mind the trade in agricultural produce across the Irish Sea. Substantial amounts of agricultural produce are exported to our nearest neighbour, which is our largest market. Despite this, we have not secured any assurances about what will happen in respect of this trade. Many exporters are extremely concerned about the possible outcome of Brexit. Many companies that export to continental Europe transport goods across Britain and we have not been given any assurances on this trade.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	The State relies on oil it stores in Britain and the North. Joined-up thinking will be required in respect of this issue and I ask that it be given special attention. Given his brief, the Minister of State will understand that without energy, we will not have industry, jobs and many other things. It is crucial, therefore, that we are able to turn on the lights and have power, including gas and oil, in order to drive industry until we develop alternative sources of energy. Realistically, we do not have a replacement for the gas we currently import and on which the economy relies. If Britain opts out of the customs union and Single Market, tariffs will be imposed on gas and our trade with Britain will acquire third-country status. According to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Corrib gas field will supply gas for a little more than ten years. We must develop renewable energy sources and copperfasten the all-Ireland electricity and gas markets, including the wholesale markets. I ask the Minister of State to address the specific issue of oil.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	Maximum pressure is being applied at European Union level regarding Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom. Our colleagues in the EU have an excellent understanding of Ireland's special relationship with the UK, particularly in the area of trade, but also in other areas, including those to which the Deputies refer. The Government wants clear progress to be made on the protocol before the June Council meeting. Neither the Government nor the EU task force wants to put this matter on the long finger. Last week, at a meeting in Iveagh House, which I am sure Sinn Féin representatives attended, the Tánaiste updated members of the political parties on the Brexit talks. The EU has made clear that the backstop, as set out in the protocol, is a viable solution for avoiding a hard border. It will mean that there will be no physical infrastructure or associated checks and controls in place. It is vital to have this legal certainty in the withdrawal agreement to ensure that regardless of what happens in terms of the agreement between the European Union and the UK on their future relationship, there is no prospect of a return to a hard border The Tánaiste and Taoiseach will have an opportunity to take stock next week when Mr. Barnier visits County Louth. Tomorrow evening, Mr. Barnier will make his views clear to Mr. David Lidington, as he did last week when he met the deputy Prime Minister in Westminster. We are very much on top of the matter. The period leading up to June 2019 will be critical and sensitive negotiations are ongoing. Time is of the essence. I thank all the political parties for their co-operation to date. We must take this journey together because Ireland's interests are in all our interests. As the UK exit date edges closer, we must make progress in the negotiations. As I stated, the Irish issue has been identified as a key element of the negotiations. It is important that our EU partners understand where we are coming from. The issue of Ireland remains high on the agenda of all Ministers when they travel abroad. The next couple of months will be crucial in the context of ensuring that we get the protocol in place.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	It is a sad day for artistic and political freedom in Ireland when a simple mural on the wall of the Project Arts Centre in the centre of Dublin has had to be painted over. I am sorry the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is not present herself as this is very much an attack on artistic freedom. It is a very wrong decision by the Charities Regulator. As I travel to work in the middle of the referendum campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, I pass churches which have posters on their railings. I am told by many that they find an amount of material from different publications on the tables at the backs of churches, all of which is consciously and strongly anti-repeal. Many Catholics find this deeply offensive and upsetting and some of the suggestions in them around what happens are deeply upsetting. It is a very sad day regarding a simple, attractive mural using the word "repeal" and the image of a heart. The referendum is about things that are close to all our hearts and which are difficult. The Charities Regulator has written to the Project Arts Centre threatening its charitable status for engaging in political activity which is not in line with the charitable purposes of the organisation. It is worth looking at this juncture at what the Act states and not just at the guidelines on political activity issued recently by the regulator. The 2009 Act excludes from being registered as a charity a political party or body which promotes a political party or candidate or a body which promotes a political cause unless the promotion of that cause relates directly to the advancement of the charitable purposes of the body. The Act does not exclude any charity from engaging in a collaboration with any of those bodies. Neither does the Act have an express ban on charities engaging in political activity. The Act also lays down the circumstances in which the authority, after consultation with An Garda Síochána, can exclude a body from the register. These are circumstances where something is either unlawful, contrary to public morality, contrary to public policy, in support of terrorism or terrorist activities or for the benefit of an organisation membership of which is unlawful. None of these, as far as I am aware, applies to the Project Arts Centre and its collaboration whereby the mural was painted on the wall of the centre in public view. I was involved in the development of charities legislation some time ago. The last time I checked, most religious bodies in Ireland were charities, which is rightly so. I do not object to that. I do not object to churches having huge amounts of material from posters to leaflets, sermons and events relating to their view in respect of the referendum. That is as it ought to be in a civic society. I object very much to the interference with the artistic and political freedom of the artist, which is essential, in this decision by the Charities Regulator which has forced the mural to be removed.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I thank Deputy Burton for raising this issue. The Charities Regulatory Authority was established in October 2014 pursuant to the Charities Act 2009. The authority is the State organisation responsible for registering and regulating all of Ireland's charities. Its role is to provide effective and robust regulation in accordance with the 2009 Act. Responsibility for the regulator, which is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions, has been assigned to the Department of Rural and Community Development. The general function of the authority is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration. Section 39 of the Charities Act 2009 sets out the regulatory basis on which organisations register with the regulator. If anyone has concerns that a charitable organisation is in breach of the 2009 Act, he or she may forward details of those concerns to the regulator directly. I am advised that all concerns received are actively reviewed. On receipt by the authority of an expression of concern relating to a mural on the Project Art Centre's property, the authority indicated to the trustees of the centre that the continued display of the mural would, in the authority's opinion, constitute a political advertisement in respect of a matter for which the charity was not set up. I understand that all complaints are handled by the complaints committee within the Charities Regulatory Authority. The net effect was stated to be that if the display was to continue, the charity ran the risk of being deregistered from the authority's register. The authority has the power under the 2009 Act to consider matters of concern in relation to the running of a charity and action such as deregistering a charity may be taken if deemed necessary. I emphasise that the authority is completely independent in carrying out its functions and in making any decision in relation to enforcement. The authority took the view in this case that the charity was engaged in making a political statement for a purpose for which it was not set up and, thus, fell outside the remit of the 2009 Act. I am advised that the Project Arts Centre itself indicated during its interaction with the authority that it was relying on an exemption under the planning code in relation to political advertisements. In the authority's view, this was a de facto concession that the centre was engaged in a political activity outside the scope of its established purposes. The Charities Regulatory Authority is independent of Government in its deliberations and my Department has no function in its day-to-day operational activities. As Minister of State, I had no hand, act or part in this decision. I am advised that the trustees of the centre indicated to the authority on 20 April that they would arrange for the removal of the mural and it was subsequently removed on 23 April as we saw on television.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	I am taken aback by the content of the Minister of State's reply. There are two sides in a referendum, namely, those who are for the referendum proposal and people who are opposed to it. Voters are free to go to the polls and decide which way they want to vote. We have a situation in which a very one-sided interpretation of the powers and guidelines of the regulator has been effected with the result that a very simple image had to be taken down. One can walk past this House any day. I was with some people as I came in yesterday morning and they practically got sick when they saw the large-scale posters of foetuses in various states on display outside. I pass churches regularly. For the most part, the posters outside churches are simple "No" posters but I am regularly told about some of the material that is available inside churches. Can the Minister of State confirm that churches are, by and large, charitable organisations? If the Charities Regulator is going to take action against a simple poster which contains nothing offensive and deem it to be political, is the Minister of State telling me, as holder of his office, that the same regulator will go into churches and check out the material there? I am not suggesting the regulator should do that, rather I am suggesting it is not being even handed. There is an interpretation of the law there. The Act lays down the circumstances in which the authority can, after consultation with gardaí, exclude a body from the register. That was the threat against the Project Arts Centre. That is where something is unlawful, contrary to public morality, contrary to public policy, or in support of terrorism or terrorist activities. Does the Minister of State think the Project Arts Centre, which has operated in Dublin for 50 years, does any of those things?

I would hope that if any mural which had a slogan “Love Both”, “Save the Eighth” or “Do not Prohibit Abortion” was similarly covered over, the Deputy would take the same stance, like Deputy Coppinger when she raised the matter yesterday on Leaders’ Questions. Complaints were made to the Charities Regulator. If there are complaints about a specific church or churches - I think all churches, not just the Catholic Church, are against abortion - to the Charities Regulator, I am sure it would investigate them and make recommendations. I cannot say what it would do. The publicity and television coverage generated by the actions of the regulator have done more for the repeal cause than if the mural had been left there. I did not see it and would not be in that area. However, it has reached a wider audience because of these actions. The Charities Regulator is independent in its functions. People can make complaints to it about any other organisation if they so wish.

I welcome representatives of nurses and midwives, as well as their unions, particularly the INMO, who are in the Visitors Gallery. Tá na haltraí agus na cnáimhsigh tar éis go leor a dhéanamh ar son na seirbhíse sláinte ach anuas air sin déanann siad cuid mhór don tír ar fad. Is iadsan na daoine atá ar an líne tosaigh agus is orthu atá sé cúram sábhailte a chur ar fáil nuair nach bhfuil an maoiniú, an fhoireann nó an infreastruchtúr ann. Leis an rún seo inniu, tá bealach ann chun an scéal seo a chur ina cheart maidir le pá agus coinniólllacha oibre chun tacú lenár gcuid altraí agus cnáimhseach. Nurses and midwives not only make a significant contribution to the health service, they continue to make a similar contribution to society. There are over 36,000 WTE nurses and midwives across the State. I doubt that there is a Deputy or a person in the State who does not know one personally or who is not related to a nurse or midwife. They are diligent, hardworking and caring professionals who are passionate about delivering the best health care possible. They are also workers. This is not a vocation for them. The measure of nurses and midwives is that, in the midst of a crisis across the health service, anyone who raises a concern or a problem will always say that the nurses could not have done more. People will say that even though they were left on a trolley for 24 hours or they sat in pain in the emergency department, that the staff, especially the nurses, offered exceptional care in a calm and compassionate way. This is in stark contrast to the very conditions in which they work. Nurses and midwives are on the front line, carrying the burden of trying to maintain a safe level of care within a reality of reduced services, decreasing staff numbers and increased demand. They work longer hours per week compared with their counterparts in other countries - 1.5 hours longer than nurses in Canada and Britain and one hour longer than nurses in Australia - and for less pay. Added to this, nursing and midwifery are high-risk occupations in terms of aggression and physical assault with an average of 34 physical assaults on nurses and midwives every month. In recent years, the situation for nurses has worsened as a result of the deterioration in working conditions and pay issues. Their jobs have become characterised by extremely high-stress working environments, poor staffing levels associated with unsatisfactory working conditions and a poorly controlled working environment. It is hard to describe the damage the recruitment moratorium, introduced in the health service two years before all other areas of the public sector, had on nursing and midwifery. It has had a near crippling impact. In December 2007, there were 39,006 WTE nurses and midwives in the HSE. At the end of December 2017, that number stood at just 36,777. That is the cold truth of it. Nursing and midwife numbers are down significantly at a time when both the need for and use of health services are increasing. All the while, the work and dedication of nurses has been taken for granted. Successive Governments have failed to understand or address their situation or the reasonable requests they have made for better working conditions, better facilities, more supports, increased training opportunities and for the issue of pay to be addressed. If something is not done to increase nursing and midwifery numbers and address the issues which they and their unions have outlined as being a barrier to entry to the professions and a cause for exit, the crisis in the health service will only escalate. The professions of nursing and midwifery are at a crossroads. Not addressing the fundamental problems identified will have a calamitous impact on the health service. The motion calls for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals and which prioritise pay. It also calls on the Government to work with unions to draw up a roadmap on how full pay equality will be achieved for nurses and midwives, with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe. Nursing is not a vocation. Much and all as our nurses love their work, they do not do it just because they love it. They have mortgages to pay, car loans to be serviced and kids to be fed. It is time we addressed the real issues of recruitment and retention and which central to both is pay.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	I wish to extend a warm welcome to those who join us for this debate this afternoon. I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, on her ongoing work and advocacy in respect of this issue and on bringing forward this motion. In recent weeks, I have travelled across the State and met nurses and their representatives. At each meeting, the story has always been the same. Our nurses are under severe pressure and strain because of the stress-cauldron working conditions within our underfunded and under-resourced health services. The majority of nurses are worn down by the conditions and overcrowding they face in our accident and emergency departments, on our wards and in our clinics. It does not end there. The scandalously poor level of pay does not allow nurses to meet the scandalously high cost of living in the Ireland of 2018. This is particularly true for new entrants starting on a salary of €28,000. They must work for 12 years before reaching the dizzy heights of the top rate of €44,000. It is fair to say the nursing profession is not alone at a crossroads but potentially will be driven to its knees. Working as a nurse in this State has become such an unattractive proposition for significant numbers of final year nursing students that they have already indicated their intention to leave Ireland and move elsewhere for better pay and conditions. This is not just young or newly-qualified nurses. There is now a trend among highly experienced nurses to leave the health service out of necessity in order to earn better pay abroad. The situation in our hospitals has been well rehearsed on the floor of the Dáil time out of number. We know it is often difficult to find cover for a nurse who is sick, even on a short-term basis. Under the Fine Gael Government, our nurses must choose between remaining at home with low pay and woeful working conditions or emigrating in search of something better. That is a damning indictment of the Government Front Bench and the position of the Minister for Health. Of course, the latter office was previously occupied by the Taoiseach.The unfairness towards, and mistreatment of, nurses is a direct result of the Government's policies. We remember Deputy Enda Kenny promising time and again that Fine Gael would end the hospital trolley scandal. So committed was Fine Gael to this promise that it became the message of a now infamous billboard campaign, its infamy having come about because the promise was not kept. In the time Fine Gael has been in charge, that promise has been smashed to smithereens. The crisis went from bad to worse as the baton was handed from Deputy Enda Kenny to the former Ministers, Senator Reilly and Deputy Varadkar, and now to the current Minister, Deputy Harris, who is in the driving seat.  Nurses are at the front line of our services. I am sure the Minister understands that bad working conditions, overcrowding, low morale and poor levels of pay are interconnected, one follows the other as sure as night follows day. What is particularly infuriating in the case of nurses is that, in my view, this is being done as a strategy to hollow out the public health service and make it more attractive for privatisation. The lives of nurses, their careers and aspirations, the well-being of their families and their ability to plan for the future are all sacrificed on the altar of this bad health policy. A stand-out theme from recent budgets has been the paltry level of investment of new money into the health services. We need a Government that will invest in the public health service to improve conditions and pay for nurses. Anything less than that is exploitation because not only do nurses get up early, they also go home very late but yet they are locked out of prosperity and opportunity. This must change. The Government has a duty to do right by those who treat our most vulnerable and our sick. The goodwill, talent and professionalism of nurses should never be taken for granted. Nurses deserve fair pay, good conditions and a fair future. As a first step to achieving this, I hope the Minister will not merely support this motion nominally but will grasp the initiatives outlined in it and make it happen.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I welcome the representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation who are in the Gallery for this debate. I was in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, this week to visit a former Teachta Dála, Paddy Agnew from Louth, who has been waiting for more than a month on an appointment to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The National Rehabilitation Hospital is seriously under-resourced. I have raised this with the Minister. Paddy spoke to me of the great work being done by the nurses and other health workers. I am sure he speaks for the vast majority of patients and that has also been my experience. I commend, acknowledge and thank nurses and other health nurses for their great service to society.  There is a crisis in our health service, we all recognise that. Nurses and midwives are in the front line of this crisis, trying to ensure that sick citizens are properly cared for in a safe environment. This crisis exists at all levels from emergency departments, elective surgery, waiting lists and the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives. Last month saw the highest ever number, more than 10,500 citizens, of patients on trolleys. Nursing and midwifery staff make up 33% of the public health workforce and the profession is predominantly female. I often wonder if they were male, would they be treated as badly. As Deputy O'Reilly noted, they work longer hours than nurses and midwives in other states like Britain and Canada and have much worse terms and conditions. It is no wonder that there is a high turnover rate among nursing staff or that almost 80% of student nurses are considering emigrating for better pay and working conditions.  The Government recently published its framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix, which is based on international research and was piloted in three hospital sites, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. However, it means nothing unless the necessary investment is made to provide for the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives, including an agreement with the unions on full pay equality.  It is time for real action, decisive action, to resolve the crisis in our health services. The Government should agree with the unions realistic proposals for recruitment and retention of nursing staff and midwives, a roadmap on how to achieve full pay equality and an independent commission on nursing. We need a plan to attract students to the nursing and midwifery profession in the face of global competition. This means addressing the key issues of working conditions, facilities, supports, training opportunities and pay. That what this motion sets out. I commend it and Deputy O'Reilly on tabling it. 
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, on her excellent ongoing work on this issue. Nurses and midwives play a very positive role in the health services. They are at the front line and often deal with very difficult situations. Nurses are sometimes expected to be almost social workers and counsellors in addition to their healthcare role, since people often open up more to nurses or to ask them questions because they feel more comfortable with them. They have to deal with all that, as well as delivering healthcare. There are many valid criticisms of our health service but when people actually access health services, one will often hear them speak of how the nurses were fantastic and did a great job, and how amazing it is that they are doing it under current conditions. I have had many personal experiences with nurses and midwives in St. Luke's General Hospital in Carlow and Kilkenny. I want to note how excellent they were. I spent last Christmas in hospital with my son and cannot commend them enough on all their work and the support and care they showed, particularly to a child at Christmas. They were absolutely fantastic.  The work is demanding and often thankless and nurses deserve better working conditions and pay. As Deputy Adams noted, the workforce is over 90% female and I also wonder if that plays a role in their treatment. Action speaks louder than words. I call on the Minister to take action on this issue and give nurses and midwives the recognition, respect, working conditions and the pay they deserve. 
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	At some stage in our lives, each one of us will have to rely on nurses and medical staff when we are sick and at our weakest and most vulnerable. The work these people do each day is incredible and providing them with good pay and conditions should not be up for debate. My constituents in Limerick regularly tell me stories of how impressive and hard working the nurses and health workers are in University Hospital Limerick. The staff members there are under huge pressure due to shortages of staff, beds and lack of investment but always try to make sure their patients get the best treatment. They need Government help. This is not being provided by the Government of which the Minister is a member. Only last week, a woman of 85 years was left on a trolley in the brand new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick for four days, having been admitted with a suspected stroke. This is an horrific way to treat a woman of that age with a serious medical condition. It is left to the nurses to try to squeeze patients into corridors in a chronically overcrowded hospital and to apologise to the patients and their families, when the fault could not be further from their own.  I have often spoken of the dreadful overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick. It is the worst in the country. I have often called on the Minister for step in and address the chaos. Nothing has been done to alleviate the problems. Today, 54 people are lying on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick. The Minister has actually normalised the trolley crisis. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have consistently looked after bankers and big business when called on but front-line staff such as nurses, who are begging for adequate treatment, are ignored. It is a national disgrace. The HSE is struggling to attract back home Irish nurses who have emigrated, which is not surprising. There is a chasm to be bridged in making our system more attractive to work in compared with health systems abroad. I have no confidence that this Government will do that.  Fine Gael and the Independent members of the Government have failed to stem the problems of our health service. I reiterate what other speakers have said, namely, that Sinn Féin would not allow this scandal in our health service to continue. 
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I also wish to extend a welcome to everyone in the Gallery and commend Deputy O'Reilly on bringing forward this motion.It is often said that nursing is a vocation, and of course it is, but primarily it is a job and a profession that requires a minimum of four years of work and study. Nurses are held up as paragons of virtue, and maybe that is also fair, but primarily they are workers and workers do not live on admiration. They live on their pay packets and on the goods, services and quality of life those pay packets provide. Nurses work very hard for their pay. They deserve our respect and that respect is best shown by a dedication to providing them with the best conditions in terms of their rights as workers and in terms of the system in which they have to work. Nurses have been let down badly by the present and previous Governments, which sought to exploit the image of nursing as a vocation and of nurses as paragons of virtue in order to cut corners. They have been let down by their pay, especially as trainees and newly registered nurses. They have been let down by the Government's tolerance of a healthcare system in disarray, which provides a chaotic, stressful and often unsafe environment for nurses. The priority for any employer should be the safety of its workers but nurses are expected to work long hours in the mess that is our health service, straining them mentally and physically and putting them at risk all too often.  Pay is not the problem but dealing with it is certainly a start. It is the first step in showing nurses that we value them as workers who play a vital role in our society. Members should not take my word for it, even though it is important. The numbers speak for themselves, as 500 vacancies exist right now in the mental health services. That is not to say there is a shortfall of 500 nurses but that there are 500 fewer nurses than provided for in the current standards, which fall short of the recommendations in A Vision For Change. This makes each nurse's job harder and makes the workplace less safe for that nurse and his or her clients. The reasons these vacancies exist are simple. After four years of hard graft as students, during which they are expected to work a considerable number of ward hours for no pay at all and no additional supports, why would anybody want to take a job here? They would work for less than €500 a week in a broken system in which things are only getting worse. The other options are much better for them. Abroad they can take on better pay and conditions and work in a healthcare system that treats them as workers of value, not saints to be abused. These are systems which are on the cutting edge of care, are public funded and are fit for purpose.  We need our nurses. It is clear they do not need us. It is time to act to address this imbalance. We are always told by the right that the high wages of chief executive officers in the public and private sectors are necessary to get the best people. Nurses are the best people and their pay must reflect that.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	341	I too wish to begin by joining other speakers in welcoming the representatives from the INMO to the Gallery. They will be the most welcomed people ever to Leinster House. They are very welcome here today and I thank the president, vice-president, the officers and the general secretary for being here. It is important that they are here to hear the people's representatives debate what is a very important issue. I acknowledge, accept and recognise Deputy O'Reilly's bona fides in respect of this issue. I do not intend to use the time available to me to answer some of the political charges, with which I fundamentally disagree, that have been levelled at me over the past 20 minutes or so. I intend to use the time available to me to outline where we are, what we have done and, more importantly, what we need to do in the future.  The Government will support the motion before Members this evening because it shares the analysis that we are facing a serious challenge in the nursing workforce and because we share the impetus to address it. The motion endeavours to address a number of very important issues facing nurses, midwives and, as a result, the health service in a logical and sequential way. All of us recognise the importance and the contribution of nurses and midwives. We recognise this as politicians and public representatives but also as citizens, as anyone who has had any contact with the Irish health service can see the dedication and professionalism of nurses and midwives are absolutely key to its day-to-day operation. There were a number of references to vocation and to how nursing is not a vocation. In case it was implicit that I might think it is, let me be clear that I do not. The professional, education and quality of Irish nurses is something of which I am very proud and seeing our nurses able to make an even bigger contribution to our health service, as they wish to, is also very important to me. I acknowledge that nurses and midwives often carry out their work in a high-stress working environment and in difficult situations, dealing with people at the most vulnerable moments in their lives. We know that there are issues, and indeed there are some which are beyond the scope of the motion before us, which are priorities for me and for the Government. These include increasing bed capacity in the acute sector and the community sector. A number of representatives of Sinn Féin referenced trolley waits. Nobody referenced the fact that bed capacity was cut by colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party long before the troika came to town. They decided there were too many beds in the health service. If one keeps cutting beds, how can one be surprised when more people turning up in our health service cannot access one? We are increasing bed capacity and that will improve, and must improve, the working environment for nurses and midwives. This is part of a massive capital investment programme in a health service that had been starved of capital investment. Even during Celtic tiger Ireland, when motorways, schools and many other important projects were built, hospital bed capacity was not increased. That bizarre policy is now being reversed. We are taking measures like these and others to address the issues but the Government also recognises there is also much more to do. We live in a world in which there is a global shortage of nurses and midwives and Irish nurses are much sought after internationally due to the quality of the education, training and experience they have received in universities and through their hospital experience. The recruitment moratorium that was put in place across the public service from 2007 by a previous Government has had a real impact on staffing levels. Some specialties, including midwives, have been particularly affected. Our current reliance on agency workers and overtime is not a tenable or sustainable solution.  Despite these challenges, I will put on the record of the House some progress we have made in increasing nursing numbers. Nursing numbers stood at 36,777 at the end of 2017 but I accept more needs to be done and that we are still not back to where we were before the recession. Nurses and midwives now amount to approximately one third of the health workforce. This arose as part of the nursing recruitment and retention agreement that was agreed with the INMO and SIPTU in 2017. Under this agreement, the HSE agreed to appoint and fund 1,224 additional nurses and midwives. The HSE filled 942 of these posts. A key contributor to this increase has been offering permanent posts to graduate nurses. Thankfully, we have moved away from the days when, as a country, we were unable to offer our graduates a permanent job. It was the reality here for a number of years that Irish nursing graduates were being told that they could have a temporary job in the health service or they could go abroad and a have a full-time permanent job. As Minister, I can now offer each nurse who graduates from an Irish university this year a full-time permanent post in the Irish health service. I reiterate that offer on the record of the Dáil today.  The recruitment and retention agreement set out a number of initiatives to increase the workforce in addition to the additional posts. These measures include converting agency staff into direct HSE employees, offering all graduating nurses and midwives full-time contracts and increasing the number of undergraduate places in 2017. We are now training more nurses than ever before in the history of the State. The challenge is to make sure we can keep them in the State when they graduate. International recruitment campaigns continue and we have an added incentive of a relocation package of up to €3,000 to nurses who return to Ireland from overseas. As well as working to attract new staff, the agreement has commitments aimed at retaining those nurses and midwives already employed in the health service. It provides for a new career break scheme. Nurses and midwives can also avail of improved educational opportunities and career pathways through important initiatives like the advanced nurse practitioner programme. In acknowledging that there is more to do, it is important to point to the importance of these initiatives. The motion refers to the high level of student nurses considering emigrating when they qualify. I know we all wish this was no longer the case. However, I point out that even in an environment of intense global competition, the HSE has appointed 861 of the 1,055 nursing graduates, which is more than 80%. However, I accept that retention of nurses when we get them into the health service is the key issue. It is not good enough just to recruit them; we need to retain them. We are all aware that we need a plan for the future of our workforce. To that end, an additional 130 nursing undergraduate places were made available in the nursing degree programme. The HSE also introduced a pre-retirement initiative for nurses and midwives, with 37 employees taking up that offer. We have also rehired a number of retirees. These measures attempt to retain nurses who would have left the service to retire and ensures the knowledge transfer to new entrants. I have talked about the Government's recognition that we need to do more and it is legitimate and justifiable that unions would raise the issue of pay in that context. We are all too aware of the impact of the budget cuts made during the financial crisis. The nursing and midwifery workforce suffered pay cuts, increment freezes and the moratorium on recruitment which I referenced earlier. As was the case with all public servants, people were asked to do more, with less, for less. However, the measures agreed in the public service stability agreement provide a statutory roadmap for the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. This includes a series of salary increases that will see public servants, including nurses, receiving on average a 7% increase over the lifetime of the agreement.The agreement commits to 90% pay restoration by 2020. In addition, a number of allowances have now been restored. Addressing pay, though, is a complex issue, and more work needs to be done on it. This is why I am pleased to see that the second phase of the work of the Public Service Pay Commission is under way. The commission is adopting a modular approach to reporting on its work, and its first module will include an examination of nurses and midwives. I look forward to its report and it being a roadmap for Government in how we deal with this issue. The Government took the decision that there should be a phase two of the pay commission in recognition of the recruitment and retention challenges we face in the health service. I know our unions and stakeholders, including the INMO, have an opportunity to feed into this process and to make their submissions and have them assessed. Calls for pay parity for all new entrants are being addressed as part of another process under way being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A data-gathering exercise has been carried out, and my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, provided a report to the Oireachtas on these findings. This report makes clear the Government's commitment to working with the parties to address these issues, mindful of the cost involved. Further engagement, as colleagues know, is scheduled for this week. As a result of the work being undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission and the other numerous processes I have outlined, I do not agree that this is the appropriate moment to establish a new independent commission on nursing. I would rather see the pay commission conclude its work, and the outcome of that being implemented in terms of recommendations on recruitment and retention. I would also like to see further progress made in rolling out the framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix in medical and surgical care settings, which I launched with the INMO and SIPTU in recent weeks. This is the first time in the history of our State that we have actually provided an evidence base as to how many nurses and other healthcare professionals are needed on each ward to manage patients safely and to have a good working environment. During the pilot stage of this framework, it demonstrated significant benefits for both patients and staff, and I welcome the support of nurses in the roll-out of this nationwide. We have seen in the pilot sites a sustained decrease of up to 95% in the use of agency staff. Therefore, it is clear we need to spend to save and that investing in evidence-based programmes such as the framework can make real progress in addressing the issues of retention and recruitment. It is clear that the issues in the motion are complex and important. It is right and proper that they are raised on the floor of the Dáil and that as a country we try to grapple with how to address them now that we find ourselves in a better economic space. We have all accepted that nurses and midwives are a significant and important part of our health workforce, significant both in the number of staff they represent and in the sense of the services they provide, which we greatly value. In not opposing the motion, the Government accepts there is more to do but also acknowledges that a significant amount of work is under way. The work of the pay commission is extremely important, and I know that unions have made submissions to it. Let us await the findings of the pay commission to see the recommendations it makes, which will guide Government as we go forward. However, I assure the House and nurses and midwives that under this Government's policies we will see more nursing jobs, more colleagues working with them on the ward, more beds open, a plan for universal healthcare, as envisaged by Sláintecare, and the issue of pay continue to be addressed not just through the public service stability agreement, but also through the ongoing work of the pay commission.

The motion before the House speaks to the importance of nurses and midwives in Ireland and to the many challenges now faced by those professions. I wish to recognise the work of Deputy O'Reilly in developing and tabling the motion, which Fianna Fáil will support. It is abundantly clear that all is not well for Ireland's healthcare professionals. This is true for our doctors and equally true for our nurses and midwives. I acknowledge the attendance in the Gallery of representatives of nurses and midwives. The importance and value of nurses and midwives is well recognised and cannot be overstated. They provide the majority of care in Ireland by a long distance. They make up a full third of everyone employed in healthcare in Ireland. For every hospital doctor and consultant, there are about four nurses and midwives, and for every GP in Ireland there are about ten nurses and midwives. Therefore, they carry the biggest load. They work every day to provide the very best in clinical and non-clinical care in our hospitals and throughout our communities. Ireland's nurses and midwives are highly educated, highly trained and highly skilled. They have an outstanding clinical reputation around the world and are duly sought after in an increasingly competitive global healthcare labour market. However, we need them here in Ireland. This means we must make Ireland an attractive place for nurses and midwives to work, to develop professionally and to have their careers here. We cannot compete, nor should we, with the zero-tax offers of the Middle East and, sadly, we cannot compete with the Australian climate, but there are many things we can do. We can ensure equal pay for equal work. We can ensure a workplace where our healthcare professionals do not work in fear of being assaulted daily. We can ensure that on wards, in emergency departments and in primary care the nursing teams are of a sufficient size and skill mix to be able to do the job they know how to do. We can ensure there is access to high-quality training. Right now, these things are not ensured in Ireland. As the motion sets out, assaults on staff in hospitals have skyrocketed. In 2011, there were 673 reports of assault. By 2016, just five years later, that figure had grown to 3,462, an absolutely extraordinary rise in the number of reported assaults. Three quarters of respondents to a recent INMO survey said current hospital conditions are resulting in poorer-quality training. Trolley counts are higher than they have ever been. Waiting lists are longer than they have ever been. Hospital bed occupancy is estimated to be at approximately 100%; some estimates put it at over 100%. Either way, it is much higher than accepted, safe international levels. All of this, of course, makes for a very stressful and difficult working environment for all our healthcare professionals, including, obviously, our nurses and midwives. We are seeing the results in demotivation, frustration, resignation and emigration. A recent survey of hospital nurses found that for every ten nurses leaving their jobs, seven are resigning. Therefore, it is not retirement or sickness; it is voluntary resignation from those jobs. I met INMO representatives just yesterday. They cited the following as some of the top reasons for these resignations: pay, including the difference in pay for new entrants; working conditions, including incorrect team sizes and skill mixes; and a deteriorating learning environment. As to whether there is currently a shortage of nursing staff on average across the HSE, there are mixed views. The capacity review by the HSE benchmarks Ireland against some of the best healthcare systems in the world: Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. It shows that Ireland has the youngest population. As such, we should need less healthcare than the other countries. We should need fewer hospital beds, doctors and nurses. The capacity review also shows that Ireland has more nurses per population than Australia, New Zealand and Sweden, although fewer per population by quite a bit than Norway, Denmark and Finland. The INMO has written on this and it disputes the benchmarking figure. It believes the figures for Ireland are overestimated relative to the other countries. On top of this - this is one for the Minister - for some bizarre reason, the capacity review does not include an analysis of the number of nurses and doctors we have, the shortage today or the number we need in the future. It includes an analysis for primary care, GPs, practice nurses, acute beds, ICU beds - all sorts of things - but it does not include an analysis for nurses or doctors in hospitals. There is, therefore, no official HSE or Government figure for the projected shortfall in the coming years, so we do not know that, and we need to know it quite soon. There are things we do know. We know there are approximately 2,200 fewer nurses and midwives working in the system today than there were ten years ago. We know that in those ten years healthcare activity has increased a lot, so we know there are substantially fewer nurses and midwives dealing with a substantially greater workload. We know that in 2017, almost 80% of student nurses said they were considering emigrating after graduation. We know that in some hospitals and community care teams, understaffing exists and is making the job unbearable. We know that in the UK, a recent report estimated that the NHS will be short somewhere between 14,000 and 42,000 nurses and midwives.The figure of 42,000 is more nurses and midwives than work in Ireland, so that is an estimate of how many the NHS could be short. We know that Brexit is being blamed, quite rightly, for a record number of nurses and midwives from other EU countries leaving the NHS, which is something that maybe should have been considered beforehand. Applications for nursing degrees in the UK from people from other EU countries is down by a quarter. We also know the NHS is actively targeting experienced and graduate nurses and midwives in Ireland, and that it has an awful lot of resources at its disposal to attract them into the UK. The question is, what can we do about all of this if we accept that we have a serious problem on our hands, that the current position for our nurses and midwives is not sustainable, that their working conditions and unequal pay are not acceptable and that inadequate access to continuous professional development is not acceptable? We can make sure that pay equality is achieved quickly. The report on pay equalisation was a key demand made by Fianna Fáil in the confidence and supply arrangement. The report has been published and there is an onus on the Government as a matter of urgency to set out a roadmap for how equal pay will be delivered and rectified for new entrants. We need the complete unwinding of FEMPI on a fiscally sustainable basis and we need it to start before 2020. My understanding of the current Government proposal is that consideration will begin in 2020. Fianna Fáil's view is that it needs to begin before then. The Government needs to ensure that nurses and midwives receive ongoing training. The Government needs to take immediate steps to ensure the rise in assaults is not just stopped but immediately reversed. It is utterly unacceptable and entirely preventable. We should ask no one in this country to go into work in fear of being assaulted. Longer-term measures will help, including reducing stress on the hospital system thereby reducing the frustration of patients, but there are short-term measures that can and should be taken. We need to ensure that the staff ratio and skill mix are correct. The framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix is an indicator of where we need to go. The pilot study is interesting. It has seen improvements in the retention of nurses, the reduction of agency staff and positive outcomes for patients. The lessons learned in this pilot must be rolled out on a wider basis. The Minister has laid out steps that have been taken and it would be unfair to say nothing has happened because things have happened, but when I talk to nurses, midwives and other healthcare professionals, they say that they see an awful lot of reports and hear a lot of warm words but, to date, they have seen very little action, and it is action we would like to see as soon as possible on behalf of the nurses and midwives.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion on nursing pay and recruitment and I am glad to support it. Our nurses work to an incredibly high standard. I know this because my sister is a public health nurse. They remain committed to the task at hand amid intense pressure as our hospitals and care centres struggle to cope with a lack of resources. The HSE has a clear shortage of doctors and nurses working in our hospitals and in our communities. Research from the ESRI shows how we will witness increased demand for healthcare services over the next decade. To meet this rise in demand, the Government must address the need to recruit and retain key healthcare staff and, in particular, nurses. As my party's Front Bench spokesperson on mental health, I have seen first-hand the amount of pressure that psychiatric nurses endure on a daily basis. Within mental health services, nurses' conditions of work are so poor that no pay would convince many of them to stay on. Wholly unsatisfactory working conditions make it difficult for nurses to meet the overwhelming demands on mental health services. Safeguards against assaults on staff within psychiatric facilities at times appear non-existent. Often the patients who carry out assaults mean no harm, as they are not in control of their own actions during these assaults. However, nurses in the mental health services clearly face increased risks from such assaults in their line of duty. There is no question but that the shortage of staff is a key contributor to this. Accordingly, special measures are needed to ensure they can carry out their work in a safe manner. Last week, The Irish Times reported on how staff members at one psychiatric unit were recently threatened by a former patient with a butcher's knife. The situation was so severe that staff locked themselves and patients into rooms. The Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, believes that staff shortages and the lack of development of alternative services, as highlighted in A Vision for Change, may be linked to the growing number of assaults on healthcare staff. For example, according to a PNA survey, there is a significant shortage of staff in Waterford's mental health service. The dearth of resources places an extraordinary burden on these nurses who meet families with children in dire straits. The impact on the nurses' own mental health must be horrendous. We saw some of this impact only last week at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, when some excellent staff came before us to explain their experiences and the stress they are under. Waiting times are chronic and children are not being assessed for mental health services in a timely fashion and sometimes not at all. At the end of January this year, 1,635 children had been waiting more than 12 months for a primary care psychology appointment. It is almost impossible for nurses to triage in such desperate situations when there is such a backlog of patients awaiting treatment. The increasing number of patients presenting means that patients do not get enough time for medical attention from a nurse. Conditions will not improve unless the Government takes action and tackles the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system. We spend the fourth highest amount per capita on healthcare yet we have the worst healthcare system in Europe in terms of waiting times. The HSE must take measures in order that our nurses want to stay in Ireland and not leave to go to the NHS, a situation that almost certainly will become more acute in the event of a hard Brexit. We are losing too many graduates to the UK and who could blame them? When they leave here, they leave behind salary packages that are lower, and abroad they find they have accommodation packages, good conditions and upskilling opportunities but, more importantly, they feel appreciated. The Government needs to comprehensively resolve once and for all recruitment and retention and show that nurses are deeply appreciated in this country.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	Fianna Fáil recognises and greatly values the contribution the nursing and midwife professions make to our healthcare, often in the most difficult and trying of circumstances, especially in the acute sector. We welcome the tabling of this motion and are supportive of the aims and objectives stated within it. I thank Sinn Féin for tabling it. As the ESRI projections and the capacity review make clear, there will be significant increases in demand for healthcare over the next decade. It is estimated that by 2030 there will be approximately 1 million people in Ireland aged over 65 and by 2040, 440,000 of these will be aged 80 or more. The demands on the health services will be more acute than ever. Everyone hopes that as they grow older they will be supported to stay in their homes for as long as possible but, as we all know, this is not always possible. The levels of population aging will be associated with higher levels of disability and long-term ill-health and now is the time for planning and investment. With an ageing population, the acute hospital system, which is already overstretched to breaking point, will be unable to operate effectively unless there is more of a shift towards primary and community services as a principal means of meeting patients' needs. Therefore, the need to recruit and retain key staff, such as nurses, is absolutely imperative. Nurses and midwives are skilled, committed professionals who have a career, dependants, responsibilities and costs. They go over and above in terms of hours worked and they are very committed to their patients and their profession. Fianna Fáil believes that the Government must set out a clear pathway for the delivery of full pay equality for new nurses. Since 2011, those who enter the nursing profession are on a much reduced pay scale compared with those who began working prior to 2011. This has led to serious financial difficulty for many young nurses, given the rocketing cost of rent and housing. It is deeply unfair that new nurses are paid significantly less than their established colleagues. These nurses are already working under intense pressure given the lack of resources in hospitals. This is then leading to nurses leaving to work abroad with better terms and conditions and a better quality of life available to them. We must stop this brain drain. We are losing our brightest, smartest and most qualified nurses to other countries and are experiencing many problems as a result The least that they deserve is to receive equal pay for equal work. The report on pay equalisation in the public sector was a key demand made by Fianna Fáil in our discussions on the confidence and supply arrangement. This report has been published and there is now an onus on the Government to set out in detail how it will go about delivering pay equality for new nurses. It will help with the retention of nurses in the years ahead and will encourage more young people to enter what is, in many ways, a caring vocation.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue and I thank Deputy O'Reilly for bringing forward the motion. At some stage, each of us has had reason to attend hospital, be it for ourselves or our families. One can see that nurses are working in very stressful situations but they carry out their work professionally. There is no question about that and they should be rewarded accordingly. The number of assaults that take place, particularly late at night and in the early morning, in accident and emergency facilities is absolutely outrageous. The job is stressful enough without having to worry about who is coming in the door or who could assault you. It is very wrong. More security should be made available in accident and emergency departments, particularly at weekends, because that is where the problem lies. The current shortage of nurses in mental health and general nursing services will only get worse and services will only deteriorate further unless the Public Service Pay Commission delivers for nurses. The reality is that on current nursing salaries, the HSE cannot compete with health employers in UK, Canada , Australia and elsewhere when it comes to the recruitment of nurses and nurse graduates. We just cannot compete. The culture of emigration among our nurse graduates will not be broken while salaries, allowances and support for professional development remain significantly better in other countries than they are for nurses in the Irish health system. The incentive for Irish nurses to take up better-paid and more attractive posts abroad is growing, not decreasing. There are currently 25,000 nursing vacancies in the UK's NHS, with experts predicting a significant further push to recruit Irish nursing graduates post Brexit. Unless there are improvements in nurses' pay which close the gap between salaries here and those available to nurses emigrating to the UK, the Irish health service will lose another generation of nursing graduates. The absolute necessity for the Public Service Pay Commission to comprehensively address nurses' pay is obvious when we consider the yawning gap in pay and conditions between Ireland and the UK. In the UK, the professional qualifications of a nurse are recognised, with the first point on the nurse's pay scale being above the maximum of the health care assistant scale. UK nursing packages include €8,000 relocation costs, educational opportunities, low-cost accommodation and a 37.5-hour week. In the UK, the nurse is recruited at the same level as therapy grades, for example, physiotherapist, occupational therapist or podiatrist. In Ireland, the nurse is treated as a lesser professional than the therapy grades. In its report, the Public Sector Pay Commission said that some of the submissions it received recognised that increasing pay will not address the issue of recruitment and retention, particularly in the health sector, and that, when compared with employment in the private sector or in other countries, a range of other relevant factors - such as a pressurised work environment and the provision of continued professional development - which impact on whether nurses remain in Ireland must be addressed as soon as possible.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I knew that was coming. Two of them are considering becoming nurses. A number of members of my family are in the nursing profession. I had to be honest with the two young people in question. I think being a nurse is a noble profession. There is no doubt that it is a vocation. It is something about which one must think long and hard. However, I also had to tell them the truth because I had to be honest. It is a very difficult profession. It is a profession that is not just difficult because of what it involves but because of the environment that has been created in this country for people in the profession. I would advise people to think long and hard about going into nursing. I would still advise them to go into it but they would have to understand what they are getting into because it is not the same career that it was even as recently as 20 years ago. It is completely different. As a body politic, we are going to have address this issue pretty quickly. At a time when we have a trolley crisis and when we consider the conditions in which many nurses work, the situation in many maternity wards, accident and emergency departments, particularly at weekends, and psychiatric wards, the future of many different services, the uncertainty surrounding certain services and what is expected of nurses, we must understand that this is a very difficult profession and we must address the problems relating to it. We must address the standard of pay when we compare it with that in other countries. Many people who enter the profession want to stay in Ireland. However, a survey of those going to college and becoming nurses has shown that a large quantity of them have said that they will leave. They will do so because they know what they are facing into, not because they want to leave. They will leave, go abroad and work and earn an awful lot more in Australia, Dubai, Great Britain and other locations because they know the conditions in which they will work. It is not all about money. It is about the working environment and the place where they will end up. They can see it with their own eyes. They must go out and train. They know what is ahead of them. I see it every day. My local hospital is University Hospital Limerick. The conditions in which some of the nurses, many of whom live near me, have to work are, quite frankly, scandalous. They are scandalous because of decision-making that has happened over the greater part of 20 years. Some of the nurses end up sick and getting injured. To leave them in those circumstances is unacceptable. We must also do something about security in hospitals fairly quickly, particular when it comes to protecting those who enter this profession because this is becoming more of an issue every week. We see many cases of nurses being assaulted. When it comes to a policy from Government, and we did this through Sláintecare, of trying to make it more viable to enter this profession, if people working in the profession are not even protected to the level they should be, it is a fairly desperate situation. I also want to raise a few issues that could help the situation. The over-reliance on agency staff is becoming crazy. There is no continuity of care and no certainty as regards the volume of people who will be entering the wards from day to day or into various different areas because of this over-reliance based on a failed policy over a period. Something that would significantly help many in the nursing profession - I have been a strong supporter of this and have spoken on it in here and at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health on numerous occasions - is fast-forwarding the roll-out of various different components of the national ehealth strategy in view of the conditions in which many nurses work, the paper trail, the administrative burden and the fact that they are unable to take lunch and are staying on at work. Relations of mine who are employed at Tralee General Hospital often stay on an hour later in the evening because they have to complete administrative work. That is not acceptable. They are working an extra hour for nothing. It is a vocation. If the procedures had been put in place to ensure that we can have an ehealth strategy and all the various components of that rolled out, there would no need for the administrative burden imposed on nurses and midwives. I am disappointed the Minister of State with responsibility for older people had to leave. I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Harris, is not present. In my remaining few minutes I wish to raise an issue relating to nurses in the rehabilitation unit in St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel. This is happening right now; I have just spoken to them. It appears a 21-bed unit is about to close, which will have catastrophic implications for the elderly patients in the hospital. There are two reasons for this. The consultant geriatrician needs to be reappointed immediately. The medical officer, whose position has been temporarily filled by locums, also needs to be reappointed. If that does not happen, this unit will have to close on Friday. This has happened only in the past 24 hours because somebody in the HSE did not realise the funding that was coming from South Tipperary General Hospital for the geriatrician post would no longer be in place and assumed that somebody else would solve it, but it has not been solved. This is what the nurses in St. Patrick's have told me in the past hour. They do not know where they will be working on Saturday. If this unit is closed, will they remain in some other unit in St. Patrick's? A number of the patients are over 90 and one is over 100.

The Minister needs to increase significantly and quickly the pay of our nurses and midwives because otherwise the problems in the health service that relate to the recruitment and retention of nurses, which is already at a very serious level, will get even worse. The Government backed a campaign to get nurses to come back home, the "Bring Them Home" campaign. It spent €100,000 on a website to advertise the campaign. How many came back? It was fewer than 50. Last year more than 50% of all the graduates left the country. Campaigns that do not get to the heart of the matter and do not deal with the issue of pay and conditions will not work. We will not be able to open new wings and increase the number of beds. How will we staff the children's hospital? What needs to be done on pay? First, two-tier pay needs to be ended immediately. There have been pay cuts of 10% - more than €3,000 per annum. The pay cuts are only part of the story. What is the position with the allowances that have been cut? Nurses and midwives have seen the following allowances - most of which are pensionable - cut in recent years: midwifery qualification; registered general nurse in the community allowance; nurse co-ordinator allowance; specialist co-ordinator allowance for nurse tutors; nurses assigned to occupational therapy and so on. We read in the newspapers that the pay element will be addressed. What about the allowance element that also must be addressed? It should be done in one go in 2019 and not spun out over a number of years. It should include the reversal of the allowance cuts. Moneys that were taken from nurses should be returned and backdated. It is not just about two-tier pay. In addition to the two-tier pay, there is a 12% pay gap between nurses on the one hand and other allied professionals on the other hand. It would take a nurse more than 15 years to reach the same pay scale and pay awards as an occupational therapist. In the Nordic countries a nurse's starting pay is €38,000. In Ireland the equivalent figure is €28,000. It is a global market. How can the Irish health service compete in a global market when there are gaps on that scale? The Government needs to ensure the ending of the two-tier pay rate and return the pay and allowances taken from the nurses. They need to bridge that 12% pay gap. We need decent pay and justice for our nurses and midwives now.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	We support the motion as others have done. I will start by stating the obvious that we have a crisis in our health system in all sectors, including in accident and emergency departments, the care of the elderly and other vulnerable sections of society, and in mental health services. There are two basic reasons for that crisis. The first is ideology of the current and past governments that deliberately set up a two-tier health service, systematically encouraging the privatisation of vital healthcare. We have poor public healthcare and poor public hospitals to ensure we have a blooming private healthcare sector that can maximise profits. We shower them with tax breaks and incentives and increasingly use the private sector to deal with public patients. We have invested a great deal of effort and money in ensuring that private health care is the cover that most ordinary people desire as a necessity because they see the public healthcare system in such a crisis. The queues across all our key services, the waiting times for treatments, scans and therapy including speech and language services for children, the home care hours, help for the elderly in the home and the trolley crisis are not a series of unfortunate events but the predictable result of a policy of privatisation, designed to force people into the private sector.  The other reason for the crisis is the one addressed in this motion - the attempt by this and the previous governments to blame the recession on public sector workers and to use the recession as an excuse to put the boot into them all, particularly the nurses, midwives and other healthcare workers. We cannot have a decent healthcare service while putting the workers who provide that service into intolerable situations of cuts, closed wards and worsening conditions in which they have to work. Nurses are also required to work an extra shift every month for free in crowded and understaffed hospital and emergency wards. We worsen their pay and conditions and we create a two-tier pay structure that discriminates against newly qualified staff doing exactly the same work. The recent Public Services Stability Agreement did not address these issues. Pay restoration is still not a reality and workers are earning less than they were before the recession. There is no real solution for workers when rents and housing costs are rising. They are being forced out of the country as clearly illustrated by the letter we all received from the Psychiatric Nurses Association today. It seems to be difficult for any Government to acknowledge that the inequality in pay and the brutal conditions under which nurses and midwives are forced to work, contribute to the health crisis. It is extraordinary that we find it so difficult to acknowledge that the pay of nurses and midwives needs to be increased when we can increase our own pay and the pay of bankers overnight. Thanks be to God there are more of them than us, but the visuals of that inequality are stark. Those Deputies who have supported the FEMPI legislation and nodded and winked when it has been renewed every year bear a responsibility for the continuation of that legislation and its contribution to the crisis in our health service because it abuses nurses and midwives. FEMPI has to go.It was an extraordinarily blunt instrument and has outlived its purpose. With that pay equality and a complete change in the way we treat our health service workers must be ushered in. We lost the whole child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, unit for six months of last year in Cherry Orchard Hospital, as the Minister of State well knows, because of a failure to retain psychiatric nurses. That will happen again and again. This crisis is in some ways only beginning because of the shortage of nurses. If we begin by paying them properly and giving them the respect they deserve we might begin to address the crisis.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I welcome and will support this Private Members' motion on nursing recruitment and retention put forward by Deputy O'Reilly of Sinn Féin. Trying to run a modern fit-for-purpose health service, faced with increasing demand and changing demographics, on minimum funding and a short-term strategy does not work. That is what previous governments have done. The problem of retaining qualified nursing nurses and midwives is yet another example of the need for a new approach to providing healthcare as outlined in the Sláintecare ten year strategy report, alongside a commitment to financially increase funding in the service. The "Bring them home" campaign was a complete failure. Launched in July 2015, it targeted 500 nurses and midwives employed in the UK. Only 91 were enticed to return to work in the Irish public health service and of them 40 left prior to fulfilling a year's service. The central issue here is pay and conditions. Comparison with other countries, particularly the countries our qualified highly trained nurses emigrate to such as Australia, the USA, Canada and the UK, shows Irish nurses work longer hours for less pay. To attract graduates and entice them home that has to be reversed to fewer hours and more pay. There are now 2,500 fewer nurses in comparison with 2007 which, along with the general crisis in the health service, has created a very stressful working environment which adds to the problem of retaining staff. Under the national maternity strategy, the appointment of an additional 96 midwife posts in 2017 was a failure too. The total number of midwives in January was 1,461 and by August that had fallen to 1,408. Instead of the workforce growing by 96 it decreased by 52. Figures show a high level of burnout. The Nurse Forecasting Study in Europe, RN4CAST, was a cross-sectional observational study of ten European countries. Ireland was second highest in the list of countries where nurses describe burnout as their primary reason for leaving. The figure for assaults is staggering. It went up from 673 on 1 January 2011 to 3,462 on 27 July 2016. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, quite correctly sees the key problem as pay inequality. Over 90% of nursing staff are female. That is no accident. Historically, women associated with caring have been less valued than others in "real" jobs. Despite having a high level of qualification, nurses and midwives are paid less than other healthcare professionals with the same level of qualification requirements. A graduate garda starts on an annual salary of €31,000 but nursing graduates after four years' training start at €28,900. In addition there is, as in the teaching professions, a lower pay level for new entrants into nursing since 2011. We have a two-tier health service with the two-tier payscale for new entrants. In 2016, in the staff nurse grade 2,573 started and 2,271 of them have left, 71% having resigned not retired. There is a huge crisis in our health service which must be linked to the implementation of the Sláintecare report which must be implemented urgently so nurses and midwives feel they have some structure to work within.

If we do not address its content the crisis in our health service will accelerate. We all know the important role nurses play in our society. I am not going to reiterate those points and patronise those people because they do not want a pat on the head. They need a reversal of the policies of austerity, which have been to no-one's benefit since 2012. It was a bit ironic listening to the former Labour Party Minister who was part of that process telling us now how it was all so wrong.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	If the Government is not concerned about the individual cost to nurses it should be concerned about the impact this is having on our health service because the motion correctly points out the correlation between the decrease in staffing levels and the increase in workload, which is a huge strain on the service, on those working in it and on all of us who need to access a hospital. The commission on nurses pay is due to publish recommendations in June and has to be cognisant of the strain that the nursing profession has been under since 2012 and has to take steps to reverse this damage. The recruitment embargo and the decision to reduce the starting salaries of graduate nurses and midwives has undoubtedly had a massive negative effect on recruitment and retention and the continued failure to address this means that the profession has become less attractive. It is an incredibly big request to expect somebody to be a nurse, a very demanding job, against the backdrop of an average industrial wage of €37,000 with the starting salary of €28,600. A person could not rent a room or get their children into childcare in this city on wages at that level. The INMO this year highlighted the aggressive recruitment of Irish nurses by UK hospitals and the Health Service Executive, HSE, is not competing on pay and conditions. The education of these individuals is funded by the Irish taxpayer and that is handed over to hospitals in the UK. It is probably just as well that they have to look after many of our women who we send over there for treatment but that is a different story. While Irish nurses consider leaving for better wages elsewhere we are left with two serious consequences: the inflow of nursing staff from other countries and the outsourcing of work to agency staff at a higher cost. The inflow of nurses from other countries, generally developing countries, has had an impact on those countries of origin in that they lose the skills to this country, where we have a highly trained workforce and should not have a shortage of medical staff. This is appalling. It is a practice that is shunned by the International Labour Organization because it creates a brain drain in some of the poorest countries in the world, which most need the profession. We also have the truly wasteful policy of outsourcing and what the new buzzword calls "self-employment" at a higher cost to the HSE. This is an overall pattern. One in five in the education sector are now on temporary contracts and this is being replicated in the health sector. According to this mythical "self-employed" category, one in ten workers in health and social work are self-employed. These are professional occupations which are being pushed into the category of insecure work. If we do not address it now it will have an impact on the health service even greater than it has already had, not to mind the enormous cost to those individuals who take on that work.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	366	I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for tabling this motion because it goes to the centre of the issues facing our health service, recruitment and retention of specialised staff. We are educating our nursing graduates not only for export but also for the private sector and other careers. Many are leaving the profession after qualification because there is little or no management support when they qualify. There is also an excessive workload and responsibility. Many nurses leave the profession for fear of litigation and because of understaffing in the departments in which they were educated, where they know what the future is. I know people who have qualified as midwives who now work in the hospitality sector and they are extremely happy to have moved career because they were under immense pressure due to understaffing.There are other issues in respect of a poor career pathway and poor career progression for our nurses. Speciality nurses who come back from abroad to work in Ireland are told they cannot work in the area in which they have expertise but must go into whatever ward they are put on. That is extremely demoralising for them and they pass word back to their colleagues, who will not return to Ireland if these are the conditions in which they have to work. Poor working conditions are a huge issue for recruitment and retention. The cost of living, particularly in Dublin, is also out of proportion to a nurse's income. That is also having a negative impact on recruitment and retention. Then there is the two-tier pay scale, which was referred to earlier. Many nurses do not feel they are valued members of the health service and, because they do not feel they are valued, they do not have a commitment to the service. For those nurses who are leaving the service, there is no exit survey to ask why they are leaving. Many nurses go to the private sector or to agencies, give up altogether or emigrate. This is the reality of nursing today in Ireland.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I am delighted to speak on this motion. We all got an email recently from a nurse which gave us the devastating news that some student nurses have as little as €6 a week left to buy food. That is appalling. Indeed, fourth-year student nurse, Tara Nic Chormaic, who is 28, has stated that the hell of the hospitals has left the class of 2018 burnt out and disillusioned. In addition, the massively disproportionate ratio in the recruitment of administrative and management staff compared with nurses, at a rate of three to one, came to light recently. It is bedlam and disorganised dysfunction in the HSE. Young nurses go into their career with a desire to help and to care for people and it is not right for them to be treated like this, that is, put into the hell of the hospitals. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath is not listening. Where is the Minister for Health? He is probably out canvassing down the street with Colm O'Gorman or something to repeal the eighth amendment. He should look after the hospitals. South Tipperary and Limerick regional hospitals are two of the worst in the country for overcrowding. The pressure the front-line nurses there are under, as well as all the other doctors and front-line staff, is just devastating. We would be brought up for war crimes, as I said before, if it was in a war situation, with the mistreatment and abuse that the patients, elderly and young, are being put through. I saw Deputy Kelly with his crocodile tears. He was part of the Government that destroyed their income and welfare and he wants to turn on the tap now. I would nearly want to give him a handkerchief to stop him from crying, with such tears for the nurses. He did not care about them and walked over them. I seek assurances from the Minister of State, as I have stated already today, that the patients in the assessment unit in St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel will be looked after. I met one of them last week who came into her 101st year last Sunday and now they are being left in a limbo situation. The HSE says nothing is happening there. It is a fact that they cannot get a doctor. We had an excellent doctor there for years, Dr. Willie Ryan, and we need to get a doctor there to have certainty for that fabulous unit in Tipperary.

Like many of our public sector staff, nurses and healthcare professionals have been badly hit in recent years. It is no surprise that many of our nurses are leaving Ireland to seek work abroad or are changing their career paths, given the working conditions and pay scales they experience. Despite the so-called economic recovery with which the Government claims to have been involved, nursing staff are certainly a cohort of our dedicated emergency staff that has not seen any of the recovery in terms of their salary. The FEMPI cuts that were forced on public sector staff have not yet been restored and are causing huge strain on our already struggling health system. Another point I wish to raise is one that was raised on Facebook recently by a young student nurse. The brave student went viral after her heartfelt open letter to the Minister, Deputy Harris, was shared all around the country. She explained her struggle of living on less than €7 per week. She talked about nurses and new graduates forced to sleep in their cars due to the unaffordable rent across Ireland, while questioning why student nurses are working a 39 hour unpaid placement each week. Although officially student nurses are not counted as staff members on the wards, they are thoroughly relied upon to keep the health system going. It is no wonder that we are finding it difficult to recruit nurses if these are the conditions they are facing. I am pleading with the Minister of State and his Government to look at this issue. They must reverse FEMPI cuts for healthcare and all public sector workers, including newly-qualified teachers, who also face a two-tier pay scale.
#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I am glad of the opportunity to talk on this important matter. Nurses are under severe pressure in University Hospital Kerry, Killarney Community Hospital, Kenmare and Dingle hospitals and Bantry General Hospital, to which many people from our side of the country go. I remember only too well the intensive care unit of Tralee general hospital as my father was there for many weeks. The night shift used to come on at 8 p.m. and they were to be there until 8 a.m. the following morning. If one was missing, they still carried on. They had to carry on because there was no one to make up the numbers and they had to do the work regardless. The amount of paperwork and work that they do, as well as the load they carry is entirely unfair. When we hear that the HSE is hiring management vis-à-vis front-line staff at the rate of three to one, it is totally unfair. It is the height of blackguarding. The Minister of State is one of five Ministers with responsibility for health in total. Why do they not do something about it? I raised the case during the Order of Business the other day of a girl who wanted to come back to get a higher degree in nursing. She gave 23 and a half years in this country before she went. She was away for three and a half years and now she will have to pay double for her course because she was out of the country for more than three of the last five years. She will not qualify for a SUSI grant either. How can the Government expect people to come home when these kinds of regulations are put upon them? This girl had given 24 and a half years of her life in Ireland. She was born here and is one of our own, bred and reared. The rules and regulations are militating against them and that is why they are not coming back. They do not have the right conditions. They are overloaded. They are driven down through the ground with work. The Government is not listening to us. We have five Ministers for health and a Government that is not listening to the people when we are calling for more front-line staff. What are they doing? Employing more managers. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. That is the truth.

I commend Deputy O'Reilly on bringing this important motion before the House. It is very prescient. There are two interrelated issues that must be considered when we examine nurses' pay. The first is that of basic fairness, the unwinding of FEMPI measures and setting appropriate levels of pay for front-line workers in the health service. The second issue is that of poor pay and conditions, which are contributing to overall strain in our health service. From the outset, it is important to state that as qualified professionals, nurses and midwives are the lowest paid professional grade in all of the Civil Service. The starting pay for a qualified staff nurse who has undertaken and completed a degree and clinical placement is €30,802 per annum. This compares, for example, with respiratory technicians who start on €37,000, or radiographers who start at almost €36,000. Both the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, PNA, have called on the Public Service Pay Commission to address this pay scale as a matter of urgency. The pay scale must be understood in tandem with the unequal conditions for new entrants into the profession introduced under FEMPI. While the process of unwinding the FEMPI cuts will continue as part of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, up to 2020, it is undoubtedly still the case that many nurses continue to vote with their feet and travel abroad to work. It is a scandal that we export highly educated professionals to Australia, the Middle East and North America when their skills are so much in demand in this country. According to an INMO study, the purchasing power parity, PPP, of nurses in public sector hospitals in Ireland compares badly relative to other countries. Crucially, PPP for nurses in Ireland is below Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the destinations to which Irish nurses are most likely to emigrate.In addition, the PNA tells us that UK nursing packages include items such as an €8,000 relocation support grant, subsidised accommodation and a shorter working week. Unless these disparities are addressed, nurses will continue to seek work elsewhere. The second issue is the inability of the HSE effectively to retain nursing staff and the impact this is having on the delivery of care right across the health service. Pay aside, nursing and midwifery are stressful and sometimes dangerous occupations. The number and frequency of physical assaults on nursing staff have increased in recent years, along with reported cases of burnout. When we look at the figures, we can see a shocking level of understaffing in our hospitals which is undoubtedly contributing to the high turnover of staff and the eroding levels of job satisfaction. It is a vicious cycle. If we take psychiatric nursing as a case study of understaffing, the figures are shocking. PNA branches across the country tell us that up to 500 nursing vacancies exist in mental health services alone. If A Vision For Change is to be fully implemented, a minimum of 1,963 new nursing posts will need to be filled. In August 2017, HSE showed that only 93 psychiatric nurses were recruited in the previous 12 months. It is no surprise that many are going abroad to develop nursing careers in countries with functioning health systems where they are treated with respect and valued. The staff turnover rate in 2016 was almost 8%. Unless we address these issues, the haemorrhaging of staff will continue. The proper remuneration of nursing staff is crucial in order to ensure the recruitment and retention of these highly-trained professionals and for the proper functioning of our health service. We cannot continue to ignore this fact.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	I welcome the representatives of nurses and midwives to the Public Gallery. I compliment Deputy O'Reilly on bringing forward this motion and I confirm my support for it. We all know there is a recruitment and retention crisis in the health service. We also know that nurses and midwives do invaluable work in our hospitals and health services right across the country and are absolutely dedicated to their profession. They are working above and beyond the call of duty on an ongoing basis. The pressure they work under is unremitting; it is not just now and again. They work in a highly pressurised environment, which results from things such as the moratorium introduced in 2007, the reduction in nursing numbers, pay reductions and, of course, the two-tier pay system. While all of that was happening, our hospitals experienced increased activity levels. My local hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, is working at approximately 125% capacity, when the accepted maximum level would be approximately 85%. There were 750 patients on trolleys at South Tipperary General Hospital in 2011, compared with over 7,000 in 2017. That is an indication of the pressurised work environment in which people are working. Physical assaults on nurses have increased to a rate of approximately 34 per month. That situation resulted in a reduction in nursing staff by approximately 3,000 between 2000 and 2017. The national maternity strategy, which requires an additional 200 midwives in 2017-2018, is completely off track. In January 2017, there were 1,461 midwives. By January of this year we had lost 52, leaving a total of 1,409. There is already a deficit. Psychiatric services face the same situation. There are approximately 500 vacancies in that area. In St. Loman's in Tallaght, there are 52 vacancies, which represents 20% of the staffing requirement. There are 64 vacancies in Portrane, which, again, is 20% of the staffing requirement. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, south Tipperary and other places, the situation is repeated. On top of that, A Vision For Change requires 1,400 addition staff in that area. We are operating in a global market. Nurses are very scarce and we are competing with other countries that are offering much better pay and conditions. It is absolutely key that pay and conditions of employment are improved and that pay inequality is addressed by this Government as a matter of urgency.

The Minister of State knows that, along with the housing crisis, the issue of the retention and recruitment of nurses has been with us for a very long time. When the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Independent Alliance sat in opposition, they raised these as issues concern. Like the housing crisis, this has not happened by accident. It happened by design because successive Governments led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael prioritised private medicine over public health services, did not prioritise our public service and allowed a situation to arise whereby far too many of our nurses are not staying in the country because of the pressures in our public health service. Nurses are not getting the due recognition and pay they deserve. To add insult to injury, a previous Government decided to create a two-tier pay structure, which has still not been resolved, whereby many new entrants to the system are not on the same pay scales as their colleagues. I remarked to Deputy Ó Caoláin earlier that anyone born in Ireland since the foundation of the State has lived under Governments led by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. That is the reality. As long as we have Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-led Governments, we are not going to have a resolution of these issues. While Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are in government and are being propped up by people such as the Minister of State, we can use Private Members' motions as a mechanism to apply pressure and to ensure we get resolution on these issues. My party has put forward practical, realistic, deliverable solutions that will ensure that we can retain and recruit as many nurses as possible. This issue has an impact on services. In Dungarvan Community Hospital, beds were closed last year because of a lack of nurses. Along with other Members, I am trying to get additional cardiology services in Waterford, but we are told that the hospital cannot recruit the staff. This problem applies across the board; it is not just a nursing issue. The Government needs to get its act together, do something about this issue, and stop prioritising private medicine over and above our public health services.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	374	It is very clear that there is a crisis in our health service. Everyone is aware of that. The crisis in the health service is reflected in the issue of retaining our nursing staff. Everything is connected. There is a crisis in housing; people cannot afford houses. Nurses cannot afford to pay rent in this city or in many other parts of the country. There is a crisis in childcare, which means that young nurses with families cannot get childcare, particularly given the long rotas they have to work. There is also an issue with pay and conditions in a stressed work environment. These things all feed into the overall problem. The Government must step in and take bold action to try and resolve these issues. All previous speakers have stated that pay is one of the first issues we have to tackle. That is true but we also have to tackle the issue of professional development and training. Many of the nurses who qualify in this country go abroad because there are greater opportunities to develop and access training in different countries.We also have to look at the whole issue of creating a better working environment within the hospital system. The shortages of staff, not just of nurses but of consultants and others, as well as a trolley crisis, all lead into a working environment which people find stressed and pressurised and they do not want to enter it. The Government has to take real action in regard to all of these issues. It is interesting because recruitment and retention is something that very clearly has a big effect on the professions and the health service but, as I said, it also impacts on all the other things around it, such as the housing a crisis. If a nurse is lucky enough to get a position in the city of Dublin, for example, he or she cannot afford to rent a house to stay here. All of those things have an impact. My third-oldest child, Clare, has said since she was in primary school that she wants to be a nurse. She is doing her junior certificate in the coming weeks and she still has that ambition. I encourage that because it is a magnificent profession and nurses can go anywhere in the world and get work. They can also contribute so much to their community, to society and to everyone around them. We all want to see more people trained and working in the caring professions, yet the State treats them so badly. What does that reflect? It is not a reflection of the people, rather it is a reflection of an establishment which does not seem to care. That has to change. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in particular, given, as my colleague said, that he is propping up the Fine Gael Government. It is time to give them a bit of a kicking and tell them they need to step up to the mark in this regard. That is what he needs to do. I know he has always promoted the issue of quality health care and the position he now holds is all about that. However, at the end of the day, he is propping up the Government that is allowing this situation to continue and he needs to reflect on that point.

I met in recent weeks with the chief executive of Cork University Hospital and representatives of the INMO. There are many things they do not agree on but there was clear agreement on the issues that exist around the recruitment and retention of nurses, which are related to both pay and conditions and which, to a large extent, are connected. The pressures that nurses and midwives are under at the moment in our hospitals, particularly the major hospitals, is enormous. Any time I speak to people in that profession, I find their frustrations are enormous and the pressure and stress they are under is obvious. This takes away greatly from their ability to enjoy and appreciate their profession. The statistics are incredible. A 2017 survey showed that 78% of student nurses were considering emigration and 81% of those listed pay, staffing levels and working conditions as the main reasons. The pressures people are under are very clear. This should be dealt with not only in the interest of nurses, but in the interests of everyone. The two great social and strategic challenges facing this country are the housing crisis and the crisis in our hospitals. To deal with the crisis in health care in the hospitals, we need more beds. To get more beds, we need to have more nurses and midwives. How do we deal with the crisis of recruitment and retention? Everything has been tried except pay, and we have to address that point. The level at which they are paid is very much a reflection of the value we place on people in the caring professions, particularly in nursing and midwifery. Deputy Martin Kenny makes the strong point that the cost of living crisis is enormous for the population as a whole but particularly for people in that profession. For anyone who is trying to rent in Dublin or near Cork University Hospital, it is impossible to find any kind of decent accommodation. Many means have been tried in order to retain and recruit but the one thing that has not been tried is pay. We need to get rid of the two-tier pay system, treat our nurses with respect and pay them accordingly.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I commend Deputy Louise O'Reilly on putting forward this important motion. It is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed. We need action and commitment from the Minister for Health because this has gone on too long. The depletion of nursing and midwifery staff from our health services and the gradual erosion of their working conditions has reached catastrophic levels. It is undeniable that if these issues of pay, retention and recruitment are not addressed as a matter of urgency, the crisis will impact severely on medical outcomes for patients. Irish nurses who leave this country arrive abroad with an internationally recognised quality standard which is much sought after but it is not appreciated here, while those who remain here at home, and who work tirelessly and with dedication in our hospitals, are treated with contempt by the State. Irish nurses and midwives work longer hours and are at greater risk to their personal safety than any of their European colleagues. They are contracted for 78 hours, or two full weeks, per year more than their UK or Canadian counterparts. On top of this, an average of 34 non-psychiatric nurses and midwives are subjected to workplace assaults every single month. That is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. I urgently call on the Government to introduce measures which will ensure the retention of existing staff and secure the recruitment of new entrants. We know nurses are under severe pressure given overcrowding has become a prevalent feature of our health service. We know accident and emergency departments are overcrowded every single weekend. In my constituency, the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore is one of the hospitals where staff are under tremendous strain. That is unacceptable and it leads to the cancellation of elective surgery for elderly patients. This is having a knock-on effect. The way we are treating our nurses affects all of society and we need to address this. It will only be addressed by treating our nurses fairly and by pay equality and permanent contracts across the grades of the professions on the pay scale, and by the introduction of new workplace safety measures to reduce the incidence of assault.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly, the other Sinn Féin Members and all other Members for their contributions to the important debate on nursing pay and recruitment that has been raised in this Private Members' motion. Similar to the Minister, Deputy Harris, I too appreciate the dedication and strength of character demonstrated by the nurses and midwives, and I value the contribution they make to the health service on a daily basis. I particularly commend those nurses who work in the disability sector. I accept the argument that all nurses deserve a decent pay rate and proper working conditions. That is one of the reasons I went into government, that is, to try do something about it. It is one of the reasons we included in the programme for Government the new accident and emergency hospital at Beaumont, the new cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont and the recently opened new kidney unit. These are all practical issues that show clearly I am not propping up any Government and that I went into government to act on these issues. To prove our sincerity, the Government will not oppose the motion, which is an important statement I am making on behalf of my colleagues in the Independent Alliance. It is clear from the contributions in the House that there are issues to be resolved but, similarly, we know measures are being taken which are clearly focused on addressing these issues. There are a number of points in the motion with which I strongly agree. We agree the nursing profession accounts for a significant and important part of the public health service and is predominantly female. We agree the average age of the nursing and midwifery workforce is 44 years and plans are required regarding this ageing workforce. We all agree the financial crisis has had a damaging impact on the delivery of service. At the same time, I will not take lectures from people who were involved in the devastation of our health service in the recent past. The recruitment moratorium occurred at a time when hospital activity and patient activity were increasing and they continue to increase. We also acknowledge that many nurses and midwives operate in a high-stress working environment and sometimes in difficult situations with vulnerable people. Regarding the issues relating to recruitment and retention of nurses, a concerted effort is already being made by the HSE to increase the number of nurses and midwives as part of the nursing recruitment and retention agreement. The overall number of nurses and midwives at the end of 2016 was 35,835. At the end of 2017, it stood at 36,777. This is an increase of 942, including student nurses. While we do not have the number of nurses we had in 2007, we must be realistic. There are challenges in recruiting and retaining some specialist staff, midwives in particular. There are ongoing efforts to address this issue. We have committed in the national maternity strategy to increase the number of midwives, and we remain committed to doing this. I know that efforts to recruit the remaining nurses and midwives will continue into 2018. The agreement also set out other key measures, including the appointment of all nursing graduates; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; reinstatement of some nursing allowances; and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. Thankfully, we have moved away from the days when we were unable to offer our graduates a permanent job. I am pleased to say that all graduating nurses in 2017 were offered permanent contracts within a hospital group or community healthcare organisation, CHO, subject to their attaining registration. Once again, the HSE has issued an instruction that all graduate nurses are to be offered permanent contracts to work in the Irish public health service in 2018. We all acknowledge that there is a global shortage of nurses and midwives, and that nurses educated and trained here in Ireland are sought after worldwide. There is evidence to suggest that the number of nurses seeking to work overseas has declined in the past 12 months. We are hopeful that Brexit will have a positive impact on our efforts to retain Irish-trained nurses and potentially attract nurses from overseas who would have previously considered the UK as their destination of choice. Pay is a significant concern for nurses and midwives. We accept that argument. We have already begun to see the unwinding of measures taken under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, FEMPI, through the public service stability agreement, PSSA. This includes a series of salary increases that will see all public servants, including nurses, receiving an average increase of 7% over the lifetime of the agreement. A number of allowances have been restored to nursing staff. Pay parity for new entrant nurses and midwives is also being addressed as part of another process being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A comprehensive data-gathering exercise has been carried out. My colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, provided a report to the Oireachtas on the findings. This report makes clear the Government's commitment to working with the parties to address these issues, mindful of the significant cost involved. Further engagement is scheduled for the coming weeks. As was said previously, addressing pay is a complex issue as it extends beyond the nursing grades. An evidence-based approach that can stand up to scrutiny needs to be taken in order to reach a solution. Phase two of the work of the Public Service Pay commission is now under way. The commission is adopting a modular approach to reporting on its work. Its first module will include an examination of nurses and midwives. The Government looks forward to its report in June. Irish-trained nurses and midwives are among the most highly educated and well-trained in the world. There are training and development opportunities available to nurses and midwives. The recruitment and retention agreement committed to providing 120 advanced nurse practitioner places. This has been a huge success for both nurses and the health service. The agreement also provided an opportunity for nurses to attend leadership academy programmes. Nursing education is an ongoing process. Mandatory training and other courses are available through centres of nursing and midwifery education. Last year, these centres provided training to 28,027 nursing staff. The work environment that nurses work in on a day-to-day basis has also received attention here today. The safety of all staff who work in the health service is of paramount importance. I can assure the Deputies that all hospitals have 24-7 security cover. The majority have security based either within the emergency department or close to it. An external expert was commissioned to undertake a review of security arrangements in HSE emergency departments, and the findings were sent directly to each hospital to progress implementation of the actions emerging from these reviews. The issue of physical assault on staff from patients or service users is a complex one, as those being cared for may not always have the capacity to be responsible for the actions they carry out. Safety in the workplace is paramount to the HSE. A national incident management system is in place which records the number of assaults on staff. This has recorded 3,610 physical assaults. In response to a recent priority oral parliamentary question, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, indicated that the HSE anticipates that the number of recorded incidents will rise as the new system becomes further embedded and better data becomes available. Much is being done by the HSE to address this complex issue and to ensure the safety of its staff in a balanced and cohesive way. I acknowledge that working in this type of environment can take its toll on a person and lead to job dissatisfaction and in some cases burnout. In these instances, I would urge any affected employee, be they a nurse, doctor, health care assistant or porter, to seek assistance from their employer and to use the supports that are in place in the HSE. Nurses and midwives are a valued member of the health workforce. We acknowledge that there are recruitment and retention challenges. However, the measures that are already in place are having a positive effect. Work continues to recruit nurses and midwives. Pay for nurses is being addressed through the pay commission and the unwinding of FEMPI. Salary scales for new entrants will also be considered under the PSSA. We await the outcome of these processes. As the Minister outlined in his opening speech, an independent nursing commission is not required. The Department's Office of the Chief Nursing Officer is doing valuable work in developing the values and future role of nurses and midwives. As we work towards implementing Sláintecare and all it will bring, nurses and midwives will be an integral part to the health service of the future.

They are the front line and the essential building blocks of our response to the care and treatment needs of our citizens. It is my belief that this State has treated our nurses appallingly over the past ten years. We have watched our hospitals crumble at the seams while simultaneously waving goodbye to our nurses at airports and ports all around Ireland as they went off to practise their skills in other countries. Ireland has provided them with world-renowned education and training, but not with pay parity or an appropriately delineated career pathway. Given the short time available, I will cut to the chase and speak about the Minister of State's specific area of responsibility, disability rights. In order to deliver on the commitments of the recently ratified United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, investment and care in services is needed, as the Minister of State well knows. Recruitment of additional nurses to fulfil our obligations to our disabled brothers and sisters will go some way to achieving this, and retention is equally important. I appeal to the Minister of State and his Government colleagues to invest in our young nurses. Invest in these caring young people, respect these highly educated front-line public employees and thereby serve the nursing needs of our citizens and communities.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	I support this motion, and I extend my thanks to the nurses and the midwives across this State who are working so hard to keep our health service afloat, despite being under such enormous pressure. If it was not for the dedication of these front-line staff, we would be in a much worse situation. However, words of thanks and appreciation for these staff are simply not enough. Many feel they have been taken for granted, because they have. They are working long hours, they are under-resourced and they are under immense pressure. They are stressed almost to breaking point, but amid all of this, they are always professional and caring.Their work needs to be appreciated through decent pay and conditions, without which the health service will be left to fester and worsen. Once they have completed nursing courses at universities and colleges and have been awarded degrees, many nurses do not see a future for themselves in Ireland and head off to the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Nursing is a profession with poor pay and conditions, particularly when one considers the level of training and education needed for the job. We must retain qualified staff in the public health system and attract new graduates by demonstrating to them that they can progress their careers here. We need pay equality for nurses.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of the general secretary and president of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. They are very welcome. Mar atá ráite ag mo chomhgleacaithe, is ceist ríthábhachtach í an cheist atá os comhair an Tí. Without repeating the valuable contributions of my colleagues, it is important to convey to the House the importance and gravity of this motion. I commend Deputy Louise O'Reilly, the sponsor of the motion, who has shown herself to have a deep understanding of and a clear commitment and consistent dedication to the issue of nursing pay, recruitment and retention and the effects they have on the health service. The question, "Who would want to be a nurse?" is often asked, perhaps in jest, when nursing is being discussed. Such is the challenge in the workplace and facing the nursing workforce. This rhetorical question has even be used as the title for a research paper examining the impact such workplace stressors have on recruiting and retaining nursing talent in the health system. It is a remark that recognises the undeniable truth that those working in the nursing profession are among the most dedicated, hardworking and caring people to be found anywhere. In ainneoin é seo, thig linn comparáid a dhéanamh idir ár gcuid ospidéal agus an limistéar cubhaidh de bharr an t-anord atá iontu. Bíonn altraí ag streachailt achan lá chun aire a thabhairt do na hothair. Tá brú mór millteanach orthu agus iad ag obair i rannóga éigeandála agus bardaí ospidéil nach bhfuil acmhainní ar fáil acu. Given their resolve and dedication, it is hardly surprising that Irish nurses and midwives are in high demand globally. With such attractive remuneration and significantly improved working conditions on offer elsewhere, how can we compete in attracting and retaining nursing talent? The evidence shows that we are not competing. Government enforced recruitment embargoes and wage cuts, coupled with underinvestment, have decimated front-line health services and driven nurses to flee our hospitals in their droves. Agus tá na himpleachtaí dár seirbhísí sláinte le sonrú gan amhras. Tá an córas uilig ag titim as a chéile. My colleague referred to the impact in his constituency. In County Donegal alone, staffing shortages have been solely to blame for the closure of 41 beds in the community setting since 2015, with all the knock-on consequences this has for services, patients and staff working elsewhere in the health service. It is against this backdrop that I back the motion and call on other Deputies to do so. By supporting this motion, we will show to nurses and midwives that the State values them as individuals and professionals whose invaluable work and selfless contribution to the health service we cannot forego. 
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I will respond to some of the points made by the Minister of State, specifically his comments on the level of assaults on nursing staff. Every Deputy who contributed in the past two hours noted how valuable nursing and midwives are in the health system. It is a little insulting to these professionals to attribute an increase in the number of assaults on improvements in the recording system. Short staffing and unsafe working conditions are the causes of the increase in assaults. It has nothing to do with the way in which assaults are recorded. Nurses and midwives are not assaulted by a recording system but in their workplaces and the way in which assaults are calculated is immaterial to staff. I have met many nurses who have been a victim of an assault. They want to know that their employer is on their side rather than telling them how marvellous he or she is because the way in which assaults are recorded has been fixed. That is of no value or use to nurses and midwives. The motion will pass because it has the support of the majority of Deputies and the Government has indicated it will not oppose it. The Minister for Health stated we should await the findings of the Public Service Pay Commission. I spoke many times about capacity and I was consistently told I should await the findings of the bed capacity review. The review found that a minimum of 2,500 beds will be needed in the system. These much needed additional beds cannot be opened unless we have sufficient staff in place. It is not good enough to argue we should wait for the Public Service Pay Commission to report or for another review to conclude. Graduate nurses and midwives will not wait and have already indicated they intend to leave the country. With respect, the offer of a full-time job and permanent contract will remain deeply unattractive to nurses and midwives unless we tackle the issues of pay and working conditions. We will not be able to increase the number of beds in the system by 2,500 or recruit and retain the vital nursing staff we need unless pay is at the centre of the recruitment process. The Minister stated he would not oppose the motion. I would prefer him, as I am sure would our guests in the Public Gallery and the nurses and midwives outside the Chamber, to indicate the Government would support the motion and place pay at the centre of any recruitment and retention strategy. Without doing this, the offer of full-time employment is an offer of a job in a intolerable and unsafe workplace, which is unacceptable and not what we want for nurse graduates. The Government hopes Brexit will save it. I doubt that will occur because many nurses move to the United States, Dubai, Australia and other far-flung destinations and they will not return. We must put pay at the centre of any recruitment and retention strategy because all the fine words uttered in this Chamber will not recruit a single nurse or midwife.

"Continuation of proceedings
42. (1) Where on the coming into operation of Part 2, proceedings referred to in subsection (2) have been commenced under the Act of 1996 but not determined, those proceedings shall be continued as if they were civil proceedings under this Act. (2) Subsection (1) applies to the following proceedings:(a) proceedings for the making, variation or discharge of a safety order or a barring order;(b) proceedings, consequent on the making of an application for a barring order, for the making, variation or discharge of an interim barring order which relates to the application;(c) proceedings, consequent on the making of an application for a safety order or barring order, for the making, variation or discharge of a protection order which relates to the application;(d) any proceedings by way of appeal or case stated which are related to proceedings to which paragraph (a), (b) or (c) applies.”. I thank the Members for the debate on this important legislation thus far. They will recall our earlier debate when I stated that a number of amendments would be introduced by me and the subject of deliberation on Report Stage. I am pleased to put four amendments before the House this evening. Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment arising out of Committee Stage proceedings when a definition of "civil proceedings" was inserted in the Bill at section 2 along the lines of the definition in the Domestic Violence Act 1996. The effect of amendment No. 1 will be to ensure that the transitional provision in section 42 will apply to all civil proceedings under the 1996 Act which have been commenced but not yet determined when Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with court proceedings, comes into operation. This will ensure there is no uncertainty in relation to the continuity of applications for the variation or discharge of orders under the 1996 Act or with regard to any appeals which may be applicable to orders under the 1996 Act and under way on the commencement of Part 2.

It makes sense. The whole purpose of the legislation is to ensure that individuals who have already engaged in the process of application to the court under the Domestic Violence Act 1996, as amended, are in a position to continue with those applications. As such, it is very important that there is no suggestion that those applications are in any way invalid because new legislation has been put in place which will have the effect of repealing other legislation. It is an important amendment which Fianna Fáil will support.

The amendments proposed on Report Stage are generally drafting amendments. I commend the quick progress of the Bill from the Seanad onwards. That is because of the desire of organisations such as Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Network and SAFE Ireland to see it progressed. A great deal of good work was done in the Seanad. I commend Senators on that work and the Minister and the Department for their constructive engagement with some very valuable amendments, in particular amendments relating to a course of control. That has improved the Bill. I commend the lobbying organisations on a very successful exercise on their part in seeking amendments and getting them into the Bill. As the Minister and Deputy O'Callaghan said, amendment No. 1 ensures proceedings under the 1996 Act can be maintained. In its most recent report, Women's Aid highlighted the barriers and dangers women face when trying to leave an abusive partner. The report contained a proposal which I think is not included in the legislation. If it is not, I ask the Minister to provide an indication as to whether he is open to it. I refer to the proposal for a rule of no contact until contact is safe. That relates to the fact that it is currently possible for an abuser to persistently contact the person who has been abused provided there is no direct threat of violence. Whereas persistent contact in and of itself may be intimidating or abusive, it is not currently prohibited. I ask the Minister to comment on that and indicate whether he is open to the idea of a rule on no contact until contact is safe. Does he intend to pursue that?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	I thank the Deputies for their support for the amendment. The point made by Deputy Ó Laoghaire does not pertain to the amendment under discussion, but it is an issue which was the subject matter of debate when my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was dealing with the Bill in the Seanad. I am satisfied that the matter of no contact is already catered for in our criminal law. Deputies will be aware, however, that I have invited parties in recent weeks to participate in a review of offences and practice and procedure in the area. I have already consulted on this issue extensively and it was a point that has been raised with me by a number of interested parties. I would be happy, in the context of ongoing reform of the law in this area, to pursue the point as raised by Deputy Ó Laoghaire but I note there is provision in law already for such a procedure. I am satisfied that it is a matter of practice and that it is robust. If there are weaknesses or points giving rise to a need for further improvement or review, I am, of course, happy to accommodate that. I would be pleased to keep the Deputy informed on the specific issue he raises.

“Amendment of Schedule 3 to National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012
52. Schedule 3 to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 is amended by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph 1:“1. An offence under section 17 of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 or section 33, 38 or 39 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018.”.”. Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, refer specifically to Part 4 of the Bill, which will replace references to the Domestic Violence Act 1996 in existing legislation with references to the corresponding provisions in the Bill before the House. Since the legislation was published, the Mediation Act 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 have been enacted. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical amendments to replace the references in those Acts to the 1996 Act with references to the Bill when enacted. Amendment No. 2 provides for the amendment of Schedule 3 to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Schedule 3 to the 2012 Act was inserted by section 29 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 and sets out a list of offences which are excluded from the application of section 14A of the 2012 Act. Section 14A provides for circumstances in which certain convictions are not required to be disclosed in the Garda vetting process. The offences listed in Schedule 3 are offences which would give rise to a bona fide concern that a person could pose a threat to a child or vulnerable person. The offence of breaching an order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 is listed in Schedule 3. Amendment No. 2 proposes to add the corresponding offence under this Bill and the new offences of coercive control and forced marriage. Amendment No. 3 is a mere technical amendment on the matter of reference to the Domestic Violence Act 1996 and the Mediation Act.

Amendment No. 2 seeks to amend the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act in order that offences under the legislation we are introducing now are included. That is appropriate. It is also appropriate that proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act should be excluded from the terms of any prospective mediation. Section 3 of the Mediation Act sets out the scope of that Act and indicates to what mediation shall not apply. It would be entirely inappropriate if a person who was the victim of domestic abuse but who was not successful in maintaining a criminal prosecution was forced, because of these civil proceedings, to engage in mediation with an abusive partner.Accordingly, amendment No. 3 also makes sense and we will be supporting it. The same applies in respect of amendment No. 4.

Members will agree that this is one of the most important Bills to come before the Oireachtas this year. We all know domestic violence can have devastating physical, emotional, mental and financial consequences for victims, as well as for society as a whole. Protecting and supporting victims has been a key priority for the Government. The enactment of this Bill is a key part of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence 2016 to 2021. The Bill builds on the protections for victims provided for in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017. In developing this Bill, my Department and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, have engaged closely with groups that support victims of domestic violence. I acknowledge the work being done by these organisations and their ongoing contribution to strengthening the provisions of this legislation. The support and assistance these organisations continue to offer the victims is hugely valuable to people who find themselves in difficult, and often extremely vulnerable, situations across society. The Bill will allow us to proceed further on the important issue of ratifying the Istanbul Convention. Ratification of this convention remains a Government priority. As soon as the Bill is enacted, only one more legislative action will be required to enable the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, namely, the Bill on extraterritorial jurisdiction for certain offences. I hope to publish this legislation in the coming months. For too long, domestic violence has been seen primarily as physical abuse. The new offence of coercive control sends a clear and consistent message that non-violent control in an intimate relationship is criminal and will be treated as such. The effect of such behaviour may be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship. Explicitly capturing this in legislation will also help victims identify that the behaviour they are suffering is wrong, encourage them to report it and cause perpetrators to rethink their controlling behaviour. Another important provision will ensure that an intimate relationship between victim and perpetrator must be regarded as an aggravating factor in sentencing for a wide range of offences. This new provision sends a clear message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in the context of an intimate relationship. On 1 January 2018, the financial contribution required from applicants for civil legal aid in domestic violence cases in the District Court was removed. This practical change will help to ensure that victims of domestic violence feel more confident about turning to the courts and remove an obstacle and a barrier to access to justice, which resulted in unfairness. This legislation will help to improve the protection of victims of domestic violence because it puts the needs of victims first and foremost and will make a difference to both men and women across our country. I look forward to its enactment and implementation. I again acknowledge the constructive contributions of Members on all sides.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	I welcome the passage of this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister is correct in stating that it is significant legislation. We need to recall that it is 22 years since the first domestic violence legislation was introduced back in 1996. We had amending legislation subsequently in 2002. It is important that the Oireachtas updates legislation in respect of this area and ensures that domestic violence is recognised as being unacceptable in our society. Now that the legislation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is my hope that it will be signed promptly by the President. After that, it is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality to determine when particular sections should be commenced. I hope the commencement orders will be made promptly. It is important the legislation is put into force and into use as quickly as possible. The Minister indicated that the legislation is there for the protection of all persons involved in domestic arrangements. However, it must be recognised that, regrettably, in our society domestic violence is predominantly perpetrated against women. There is also violence outside domestic arrangements and against women which is equally unacceptable. We need to recognise that there is a problem not just in Irish society - sometimes we think problems are exclusive to this country - but also internationally in the context of violence by men against women. It is a problem that goes much further in terms of trying to resolve it than with legislation. It is important on occasions such as this to record the fact that there is significant statistical evidence of the violence by men against women in domestic arrangements. In 2016, there were approximately 3,500 incidents of physical abuse against women in the domestic environment. In a European Union study carried out in 2014, it was reported that 14% of women in Ireland have experienced physical violence by a partner since they attained the age of 15. Up to 6% of Irish women have experienced sexual violence by a current or former partner while 31% of women have experienced psychological violence by a partner. We do not have to rely upon European studies to identify the fact that Irish women are subjected to domestic violence. The National Crime Council conducted research which found that one in seven women has experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some point. In a report conducted by the European Union on the campaign against domestic violence, it was noted 25% of all violent crimes reported involved a man assaulting his wife or partner. This is a problem that society needs to address. In fairness to politicians, we cannot resolve it exclusively on our own. However, it must be recognised that legislation is part of the solution. It is important to note that in Ireland since 1996, when the first domestic violence legislation was introduced, 216 women have died violently. Up to 63% of those 216 women were killed in their own homes. In the resolved cases where there was a determination of culpability, 56% of women were murdered by a partner or an ex-partner. Another 32% of women were killed by someone they knew. It is instructive to note that of those 216 women who were killed in Ireland over the past 22 years, 40 of them were aged between 18 and 25 years of age. Recently in my constituency, a woman, Joanne Lee, was brutally murdered as a result of domestic involvement. That was a tragic case which also revealed not only the violence that is sometimes perpetrated by men and women but also the association between such violence and alcohol and drugs. In order to deal with the problem of domestic violence, or any violence, we must approach the problem of alcohol and drugs consumption and abuse. When one analyses those acts of violence, a high percentage of them are perpetrated by people who have taken drugs or are in a drunken state due to alcohol. Considerable numbers of acts of sexual violence are perpetrated against Irish women. We know from the Women's Aid impact report of 2016 that there were 695 disclosures of sexual abuse made to the Women's Aid services in 2016 including 316 disclosures of rape. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's national helpline received 11,500 contacts in 2015 and 76% of callers were female. An Garda Síochána also has records in respect of sexual offences. It recorded 2,500 sexual offences in 2016.  I commend An Garda Síochána on how it deals with domestic violence and abuse. The Garda often comes in for criticism in this House. Domestic disputes are an extremely sensitive area, even before they are elevated or transferred into violence. My experience, and what I hear from interest groups in the area, is that An Garda Síochána plays a vigorous and professional role in dealing with examples of domestic violence.  I welcome the legislation. It is important that we re-emphasise the unacceptability of domestic violence or, indeed, any forms of violence. The only way that we will resolve the problem and ensure that domestic violence is reduced is through a legislative response - that is what we have here - but also to educate and inform young men of the unacceptability of using violence against women, and that they maintain that throughout their lives. Unfortunately, there are men in Irish society who think violence against women is acceptable. I suspect many of them grew up as children in environments where domestic violence was perpetrated against the women close to them. In a way, it is a vicious circle where violence begets violence but we need further response to this. We need to educate and to have parental responsibility to ensure that parents know the impact they have on their children as they grow up is enormous.  I commend all the parties who contributed to this legislation. It is very fine legislation, which I hope will be of use and will help protect all people in Ireland who find themselves unfortunate enough to be subjected to domestic violence. 
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	396	I welcome this Bill and the co-operative and constructive way it progressed through the Oireachtas. It is significant legislation that is urgently needed. One stark statistic highlights its importance: one in three women has experienced psychological abuse by a partner while 15% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a partner. There is a case with which the Minister for Justice and Equality will be very familiar. The woman involved is Siobhán Phillips, a woman who was shot and grievously wounded in October 2015, in the same incident that saw Garda Tony Golden murdered and Adrian Crevan Mackin take his own life. Siobhán was the victim of sustained domestic violence. Two days before she and Garda Golden were shot, she went with her family to Dundalk Garda station. She had been the victim of two days of sustained assault by Crevan Mackin. She had been beaten and slashed and was in a distressed state physically and emotionally. According to her family's account, despite Siobhán and her father telling the garda concerned that Mackin had threatened their lives, the officer refused to take a statement and insisted that Siobhán go to Omeath the next day and speak to Garda Golden. The family was also deeply upset because their conversation, which was of a very intimate and personal nature, had to take place in the public hallway of Dundalk station in front of other members of the public. I made numerous representations to the current Minister for Justice and Equality and his predecessor. Last December, I was advised that the policy of An Garda Síochána on domestic abuse intervention had been revised. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, wrote to me to say that An Garda Síochána had established a divisional protective services unit in three Garda divisions, including Louth. When I subsequently raised this issue in Dundalk station with senior gardaí, they acknowledged that the station was still inadequate for dealing with this kind of situation. They told me they had applied for funding to correct this in order that gardaí could meet victims in a proper, fitting and more therapeutic environment. They told me the funding had been refused.  I have no doubt of the Minister's sincerity in moving this Bill. However, a genuine commitment to facilitate the victims of domestic violence to report their abuse and seek help must also ensure not only that this Bill is passed but also that it has the financial supports needed to ensure it can be implemented effectively. I appeal to the Minister to order a review of the existing facilities in Garda stations for victims of domestic violence to tell their stories.  Finally, I commend SAFE Ireland, Women's Aid and the statutory and voluntary activists who work to provide a safe place and a safe place for victims of domestic violence and who campaign every day in support of victims of domestic violence. I want to acknowledge the bravery and strength of those victims who speak out against their abusers.

Domestic violence is a particularly heinous crime. In Ireland, our understanding of it as a society has evolved in recent years. It is not terribly long ago that it was not possible for someone to be charged with raping a partner or spouse. It is extraordinary to think that this was ever the case. There has been a lot of change since then but until relatively recently there was quite a dangerous misconception in parts of society that the fact that violence or aggression occurred in a home or between two people who were supposed to love each other, could be considered a mitigating factor. On the contrary, it is rightly considered to be a very serious aggravating factor and this legislation reflects that. It is an act of the greatest betrayal and appalling violence. There are still significant problems here and elsewhere of violence against women and children. Much needs to be done to address that. I welcome this Bill, which is good legislation. I have already commended SAFE Ireland, Women's Aid and the Rape Crisis Networks on their work on it. They successfully lobbied the Department on many issues. Nevertheless, there is more to do. It is important to ratify the Istanbul Convention, we need to ensure that the protective services unit is properly resourced and other legislative interventions are required. It is important to ensure funding for the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report. I also commend two institutions that are often criticised for their work on this, namely, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Seanad. It is fair to say that the Seanad has earned its corn on this legislation. It brought in several significant amendments which improved this legislation. Nevertheless, there is a great deal more to do. The Minister referred to the review that is beginning in relation to sexual offences. It is not quite the same area but there are close connections in the area of violence against women and sexual offences. I have a proposal for the Minister. Yesterday evening, it was announced that a similar review would be undertaken in the North. This is a unique opportunity which would allow us a close alignment between the legal situation as exists here and in the North in any reviews that take place. Naturally, any changes should be upward and there should be no diminution of protections if stronger protections exist in this jurisdiction as opposed to the North, but there is room for close collaboration to ensure as much commonality as possible and I hope that will take place.I welcome this legislation. It is important legislation but we must go beyond it in terms of resources and further legislation to ensure that domestic violence is something that is not acceptable in our society and is properly prosecuted.

For too long this has been tolerated. We need more than this legislation however, as Deputy O'Callaghan and others have said, because this issue needs to be approached from the cradle to the grave including through education in the national and secondary schools and through all other fora as well. It is a problem for both those who are male and those who are female, though mainly the latter as we have seen from horrific cases in the past. The situation in Dundalk in which a garda lost his life while protecting a very distressed and traumatised woman was mentioned. On facilities in Garda stations, I see the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is present. He knows from his visit to a Garda station in Clonmel that it is not at all suitable for any kind of person on any kind of business, especially not business of a sensitive nature.

As far as the comments of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, go, betwixt and between Deputy Lowry and his new Fine Gael candidate in Tipperary, one would not know to whom the Minister would give the news first, but it is fake news that he gives most of the time. When we see the plans, designs and procurement and when we see the sod turning and a builder appointed, then we can crow about it.

It will only be the thieves and the vagabonds. They can do what they like. There is no one to stop them or catch them. That is what we are forcing. When I was sitting here during discussion of the last Bill an email came into me regarding L-plates. It is from a Geraldine O'Connor. It states "Hi Mattie I heard on the news this evening about the L plate drivers [it] mentioned unaccompanied minors". She was referring to the situation we will be in, whereby cars will be seized and learner drivers' parents will be prosecuted. That part was not in the email, I am adding it. She went on to make the point, "I'm ... not a minor maybe you could bring that up in the Dáil, thank you". There are many people who, although they are on the roads and have never caused accidents, have failed the tests umpteen times for a plethora of reasons. Are they just going to be cast aside and abandoned in their houses? Will they be told to stay inside and not to go anywhere? Are they just to wilt away and die? There are many such people. I would know at least a dozen of them. I am sure every Deputy here, if they were honest and fair, would say that they know some as well. These people have failed umpteen times.  I have also had contact with people - not that many but a sizable few - who have failed the theory test. One particular gentleman has issues with literacy. Many of us would also have such issues. That test is not friendly to those who have issues with literacy or numeracy. One friend of mine only failed by one point out of 27 the first time he did the test. I am not sure of the correct figures. Every time he has done it since, he has done worse. It is just a phobia and a fear of the office space and the computer. He is not computer literate. Other people might be colour-blind. The Minister, Deputy Ross, himself chose to tell the nation that he was colour-blind through Matt Cooper or somebody after he made his faux pas on the voting here. He may well be. I am just saying there are issues like that. We are forgetting and abandoning all of those people. Then we bring in legislation here to deal with mental health issues. We are causing mental distress and mental trauma. What evaluation, sensitivity or rural-proofing - or urban-proofing for that matter - have the Minister and his officials in the Road Safety Authority, RSA, carried out on this? None.  I addressed the failures in Tipperary, the delays in getting driving tests and the wait of six months at some length last night. After waiting, someone might arrive for a test and not be allowed to do it for the flimsiest of reasons. I know of only two cases of this but I am sure there are others. Of the two I know of, one reason given was fog and the other was frost. The tester decided that the candidate could not be brought out after the person and the accompanying driver had driven 26 or 30 miles to turn up at the testing centre at the due point in time. These two people then had no test. Such people are then not allowed to reapply for a month. They are disbarred from reapplying for a month if they fail a test or if the test does not take place. They then have to wait the six months again. I quoted the figures to the Minister last night. They are savage figures which come from his own Department. These figures do not include people who have received test dates.  On another issue I might raise in defence of the RSA and the test centres, I totally do not condone the quite large number of people having tests scheduled and then not turning up for them without informing the test centre. They are taking spaces other people could have used. That is an unfortunate practice and it should not be allowed. There should be some punishment for it. Any of us in business know that one cannot run a business that way. There are people who choose, for whatever reason, not to turn up, without a sick note and without notifying the centre. It is okay if something happens on the morning of the test, if one has an accident or if something happens that stops one getting to the centre, but if people know that they are not going to turn up they should inform the testers. I want to ask the Minister a question and I hope he will not just stand up, nod, look up into the Gallery and deny us any kind of reasonable discourse or debate. In 2016 he told us that there was a backlog due to a lot of retirements. He recruited 23 new testers. Only 12 or so of them have been activated or put on the roads. Surely it does not take from 2016 to 2018 for them to be trained to drive. Have they licences themselves? Are they also learner drivers? Are they doing lessons and getting theory tests? What could be the delay? If they qualified to get the job, how it could it take them so long to be put in a position to carry out tests? There are many areas there. Is the Minister thinking about the aforementioned Geraldine O'Connor who wrote to me? Is he thinking about the likely impact these measures will have on her? She has insurance and she is on the road. She is a learner driver, she is not accompanied by her mother. Her mother and father are probably long since deceased, God rest them. I think she is a middle aged woman or older. She is not a minor but she is being treated as one. What a put-down this is for an ordinary person who wants to go about her business, whether that is to go to church, mass or meeting, to work or to the shops. She is being treated as a minor. That is an unintended consequence of the Bill. However, those in the RSA and the Department are not too interested in dealing with unintended consequences. They are dealing with the heavy hand of the law.As I said last night, any legislation must have the broad acceptance of the general populace for the Garda Síochána and so on to police it. As I said, I am a big supporter of An Garda Síochána, community alert and people supporting one another. Any police force anywhere in the world cannot police without the support of the public. That has been proven since time immemorial. However, it is different when one starts churning out legislation such as this that is anti-rural and anti na daoine óga. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. If the Minister does not understand that, it means praise the young and they will come along and prosper. They should not be put down, threatened and denied any hope of getting anywhere other than by a taxi or a bus that is not available because there are no services. The Government is taking away the train services and everything else. I brought the Minister on a tour of part of Tipperary one night and showed him the impact the first part of this legislation would have, but to no avail. He decided over Christmas, on whatever journey he was on, to bring in, as I said, additional legislation on this, including provisions concerning L-plate drivers and cyclists. The latter are outside in force tonight; I saw them out there on the road. We do not condone any accident or incident in which a cyclist is injured or hurt, worst of all fatally, but it is nonsense to try to have a 1.5 m distance on most of the roads used by most of us, including Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Collins and me. There are a few such roads out the Minister's way. I have travelled, with his hospitality, to his house once or twice and the roads were quite narrow and busy. I cannot see how he can invoke such a rule. What is the point in passing legislation that we do not have a hope in hell, not the flimsiest chance, of implementing? How will it be enacted? If the distance is 1.5 m and the cyclist wobbles and comes out to within 1.3 m, is one then in breach of the law? It is utter contemptible nonsense, as far as I am concerned. It is not even fine in the cities because I see roads in the cities, whether I am in a taxi or bus lane or whatever, on which it is not possible to keep that distance away either. Something has gone badly wrong in the drafting, design or research offices of the Minister's Department, whether it be the RSA, the Department itself or whoever else is coming up with these harebrained schemes that are unworkable, unimplementable and will not have the goodwill of the vast majority of road users. We have problems with cyclists. The proposal is for 1.3 m. In another two months' time, when the April showers are finished and we get the heat and the sun and growth, we will have briars and bushes hanging out 1.3 m into the road. This will mean a cyclist will have to go out another few feet into the road. He will be out at the white line - if there is a white line. Most roads where I come from do not have white lines because they are only narrow tertiary or secondary roads. This is the greatest nonsense I have ever seen. As I said, the Minister wrote for a newspaper for 13 years or so. I do not know how many years but I read him for many years and admired him. People said, "What a man he is". They said he was inspirational, it was a pity he would not go into government and he knew how to fix all these problems. Now will his legacy be these two items of unworkable, unimplementable, unnecessary, cruel and harsh legislation? What a legacy to leave of his time in government when there are dozens of areas across the whole transport network, from the ass and cart to the planes leaving and landing in Dublin Airport, that he could be dealing with, and then there are buses. I brought people up to meet the Minister about bringing in electric buses. He will probably deny this as well. They were able to introduce electric buses in Germany. There is a company in Tipperary that erects some of the harnesses to drive these buses. They were seeing whether we could get rid of the pollution and have a cleaner economy. That was a wasteful exercise on my part. The Minister's Department has a huge vendetta against machinery and tractors. As I have pointed out before to him, the Department was in negotiations on a statutory instrument that he wanted to introduce to put tractors of certain sizes and speeds through a test - not an NCT but a commercial vehicle roadworthiness test, CVRT. The Department has shown a lack of respect for the farming organisations, such as the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Supplier Association, ICMSA, the Association of Farm & Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI, and a plethora of other organisations in negotiations as to how we might work together. Ní neart go cur le chéile. Together we work and achieve. The next thing they were summoned to a second meeting in Kildare. I remember ringing the Minister the same evening. I was in Roscommon. It was the October bank holiday. When it came to the second meeting for a consultation, they were handed a document: done deal, statutory instrument signed. When I phoned the Minister, he told me he had signed it. That is the utter contempt in his Department. I am not blaming the Minister for this. In fairness to him, when he found out that day what had happened, he withdrew the statutory instrument, to his eternal credit. I credit him with that because he saw this was not right. If people are in a negotiating process, that is not the way to do business. The Department officials had too much power and showed a lack of respect for the Minister and arrogance and contempt for the organisation with which they were dealing. That statutory instrument was signed when the people were going up to negotiate it. I note it has been resurrected since by the said-same officials, and now the organisations are being told they will not have any more consultation and that the consultations are over. One meeting took place, and then there was the meeting at which they were brought in and shown the done deal. That is utter contempt for an industry that is keeping this country going. We saw in the snow and the storm recently that it was the farmers, contractors and all those people who had tractors, scrapers, loaders, JCBs, silage grabs and whatever else who cleaned the roads, pulled their neighbours out of the snow, brought food to people and everything else, and this is the contempt the Department has for them, instead of respecting them. We all know that if bigger tractors are too fast on the road, they need to undergo a CVRT - I am not saying otherwise - but the law was so stupid that I live in Newcastle, in Clonmel, south Tipperary, and if I wanted to go to the mart in Dungarvan, which is 20 miles away, I could not go with a tractor that is suitable for the road. This is not to say that I am in farming or have been in the cattle trade. However, if my neighbour wanted to go, he or she could not go with a modern tractor with a 40 kg box, yet he could pull out an old Major or a 30 year old Massey Ferguson and go off to the mart with the same load on a tractor that might not have any air brakes or oil brakes, only the old-fashioned wet brakes or dry brakes. This is the kind of kindergarten S-H-1-T - I hate calling it that, but that is what it is - that is coming out. It is completely off the radar that one could bring out a 30 year old or 40 year old tractor, a vintage machine, but one could not go with a modern tractor that is roadworthy and which has air brakes and everything else any more than a distance of 19 miles and 19 miles back. When I raised this with the Minister here previously, I asked if we would be like the drovers again, and if we would have to hunt the cattle and the sheep to the mart, as I often did as a buachaill óg. I hunted them from farm to farm, ten miles in cases, but one cannot do that now with the traffic. The Minister would want to get out into the country and perhaps relocate his Department from its plush surroundings and re-examine or re-evaluate the RSA. I will repeat that there is a great young man in Tipperary with a wonderful idea of a tyre app such that when any of us buys tyres, the information is put into the computer and we get a reminder after so many thousand kilometres that the tyres need changing. I know that in most places tyres are not checked or looked at. I am not saying I am the best at doing so myself, but from being involved in the machinery business I have more interest in tyres than some. However, some will just drive until they get a skid and then we see the tyre is bald. The Minister organised a meeting with this chap after about 18 months with the head of the RSA, and I thank him for that again. Unfortunately, the appointment was in Sligo on a Monday morning. The young man duly closed his business early on Sunday night and drove to Athlone or somewhere, booked into a bed and breakfast and arrived for said appointment. The head of the RSA did not even think it worthy to turn up. There was no apology, no nothing. This is the kind of arrogant, contemptible people in these organisations. These are the quangos that have mushroomed up and which the Minister wrote about for a decade at least. He wrote about quangoland and jobs for the boys and so on. The Sunday Independent would be snapped up from the shops on Sunday mornings and people would read about this man and his views on quangos. They were honest views and appraisals, but the Minister seems to have forgotten about them. The RSA is one of the greatest quangos in the country. The Minister resisted for a long time giving them extra board members, in spite of the RSA's requests, but he succumbed and gave it more board members. Instead of doing that, I would have asked them what they were doing, why they needed all these board members and what the RSA itself was costing. I will repeat what I said here the previous day, with the permission of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle, about all the testing centres in this country for the people whose cars have to undergo NCTs. They are tormented trying to get their cars through the NCT. I have no problem with the NCT for brakes, tyres, the chassis and other important things.There are other niggly bits such as a cap on a seat belt holder missing or a rubber on the boot loose and not properly fixed. Every one of the centres is operating outside the law. They do not meet fire safety regulations. I put that to the Minister a month ago and I want to know whether he made any inquiries about it. Will the RSA be allowed to operate test centres that are not within the law? This is a serious question. I have had no response from the Minister or his officials, and I do not see them passing any note to him now, but they might take down a note and ask me whether I am talking through my hat. I have this from an engineer working in the trade and he told me every one of them is not within the law. When my car or the car of the Minister is brought in, it is tested for emissions but the place is not safe for the staff and the centres are in breach of fire and other regulations and they are not checked for fumes. They can fail us and we have to sign a disclaimer for our little cars, whether it is a young 17 or 18 year old girl or a businessman, that if anything happens the engine during the excessive test with the revving up, which is very bad for engines, that it is the driver's fault. I am not blaming the testers, but they can blow the engine out of the car and it is the fault of the person who owns the car. That is a funny law. The Minister is also attacking vintage vehicles, but if they were put through that test the engines would be blown in more than half of them. They are older and were built in a different time. They have been resting up, apart from doing vintage runs which are normally held in summer time. They raise money for charities, whether for hospitals or Parkinson's groups, and the money raised by vintage runs is phenomenal. It is keeping the country ticking over. It sends sick children to hospitals abroad when the Government cannot do it. If the Minister insists on putting those vehicles through this rigorous test, most of the owners will not put them through it because they love their vehicles. They have them polished and shining. They are a credit to them and reminders of the past. They will not allow the vehicles do the test because they know the engines would not sustain the high revs on an idle platform. It is another brainwave. These vehicles had an exemption because they are only used for vintage runs and displays and they are not goods vehicles. These are all harebrained ideas from someone in officialdom who never had a lorry or van, never had to travel a country road and never had to cycle because they can pop on a Luas, a DART, a bus, a taxi or the new metro underground. This morning I heard on "Morning Ireland" that the Government has spent €180 million so far on studies and reports for a project in Dublin. The Tipperary county manager has made a submission to the Minister and we met him last week. He is looking for €190 million to try to bring the roads back to a reasonable modicum of where they should be and he is being laughed at, but the Government can spend €180 million on consultants, design engineers and desktop studies without a test hole even being dug or any public consultation. The amount of €180 million is chicken-feed and we cannot get money to fill potholes or deal with a street in Tipperary town which, if one drove on it twice on the way back from the NCT centre, one's car would no longer have a valid NCT because the tracking would be out or ball joints would be gone wrong. The Minister will not deal with these issues. He came down and saw the street in Tipperary and I thank him for it. He saw how bad it is but fágadh é mar atá sé. It has been left the way it was. There is a plethora of issues to be dealt with, and this is the best the Minister can come up with and persist with. We who have to live in rural Ireland opposed it, and we are doing no more than representing our people because it is our duty. The Minister went off over Christmas on his journey and came back and decided to lock up L-plate drivers and their parents and take the cars from them. They might have saved up for that car and it might have cost €2,000 or less. I bought one for €1,600 but insurance would cost €4,800. It was tested and has a valid NCT certificate but it is still parked up. Then the Minister expects people not to go out. How will they ever learn to drive if they have to be accompanied by their parents or an elder all the time? I am not asking anyone to break the law but, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said last night, insurance companies have insured and continue to insure the likes of Geraldine O'Connor, who sent me that email, which I am sure was also sent to many other people. It is like talking into the abyss but the Minister does not seem to want to listen. There is food for thought in reining in the quangos. Quangoland is alive and well and being nurtured and fertilised by the Minister, in spite of all his writings and mutterings over the years. He is fertilising, stimulating and putting growth promoters on these quangos to make sure they get fatter and stronger and have more power. They are contemptible. The contempt in which they hold the public, road drivers and road users is palpable. Beekeepers were protesting outside Leinster House today about another Bill. I listened to them and agreed with them on some issues but not on roadside hedges. Every roadside hedge should be cut back and dangerous trees should be felled and the birds and the bees can work away in the fields. I will be coming back to deal with an amendment but I honestly believe this is ill-judged, ill-timed, non-researched and, above all, has not been rural-proofed in any shape, make or form. There is no semblance of rural-proofing. By rural-proofing, I mean every place below Naas. Places in north Dublin and Tallaght and various places in the country will be nearly as badly affected as we will be in Tipperary, Kerry and other places. The Bill should be confined to the dustbin and shredded, and a serious review should be done of the people who are driving it and trying to push it because they are not in touch with reality or do not want to be in touch with reality, which is worse, and refuse to listen. There are none so blind as those who cannot see or do not want to see or hear. I appeal to the Minister to look back over the weekend on some of the musings he had in the Sunday Independent and other places about all the things wrong with quangoland, official Ireland and this, that and the other. All of a sudden they are all okay now, or is it a case of "I am all right, Jack and to hell with everyone else", pulling up the ladder and let the croppies lie down? I am very disappointed with the attitude and with the lack of answers. I hope, rather than just moving amendments tonight, that the Minister will reply to any point we have made. Mute silence is just ridiculous. The Minister will not even engage, talk, meet or entertain. I do not know what is wrong. This is meant to be a Parliament where we debate issues and Bills. As far as my colleagues in Fianna Fáil on my right are concerned, I do not know whether they are coming or going because at one time they support the Bill and the next time they are against it. I do not know whether they can find the courage to stand up with us to give us a vote, which is not expecting much. Last night six of us stood and we needed four more to get a vote and other Deputies could then vote as they wanted to. It is a sad situation.

The Bill has been recommitted. To facilitate the Minister's two amendments, the House agreed to recommit the Bill. If that had not been necessary the debate would be very narrow. The scope of the Bill has been widened, but I believe we can go outside the parameters of that rather than making Second Stage speeches. I ask Deputy Mattie McGrath to confine his remarks to the generality of the Bill and the aspect of it whereby the scope has been widened.

We have had lengthy discussion about all types of aspects of road traffic policy.

It states:In page 3, line 7, to delete "Road Traffic Act 2010 and the Road Traffic Act 2002" and substitute the following:"Road Traffic Act 2016, Road Traffic Act 2010, Road Traffic Act 2002, Road Traffic Act 1994 and Road Traffic Act 1961".We must remember that if it was not necessary to recommit it, it would be necessary to stick to the parameters but this is widening the scope of the Bill. I am allowing that because I believe it is widening the scope of the Bill but I ask the Deputy in the interests of the House to bring his remarks to a conclusion. I cannot stop him. I cannot stop him on Second and Committee Stages either, as he well knows. He can continue indefinitely but we must be responsible as well. The Deputy has 30 minutes and there are others who will want to contribute.

They use discretion all the time. They are not going around like tanks crashing into and rolling over people, as the Minister seems to think. It was the Minister who decided to recommit the Bill and that gave us the opportunity to debate the parameters. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle read out all the items in the amendment and the different Road Traffic Acts over a number of years. It was the Minister who decided to widen this provision. He could have stuck with the Bill he had, bad and all as it was, but this is a further widening to frighten the life out of young people driving. The vast majority of them are wonderful people who are trying to further their education, get jobs and apprenticeships and be part of the economy. The Taoiseach told us this morning that we have almost full employment. We want people to be able to travel to work. They cannot crawl or go in a boat. This is Ireland. It is not that big a place. We are not so remote from Dublin that we do not know or understand. We understand the situation very well. With the forbearance of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we are entitled to represent our people and our views on the doubling up of the Bill. As I said, cyclists will be brought into it as well. I am talking about this part of the Bill and despite recommital, it is why we called a vote last night. I was lamenting the fact that in the last Dáil, I was a member of a Technical Group and fundamentally opposed the outlook of many of its members. They called votes at different times and asked me if I would stand up with them and I did so to allow a vote. There is nothing wrong with standing up to allow the political process to be fulfilled in enabling a vote. When members of another party were so anxious to vote, they were disallowed and told they could not stand up to facilitate a vote. That is not democracy. If it is democracy, it is a very unhealthy one. If Deputy Troy or others are annoyed about that-----

I am making the point that I have stood up at public meetings with others and told people which way I was leaning on this Bill and so have others from other parties, yet now they are doing the exact opposite. That is all I am saying - "To thine own self be true". That is all I can do. I respect that but as I said, a plethora of legislation is being rolled out without any impact assessment of the damage it is doing to rural Ireland. I attended the formation talks for Government for nigh on 30 days with colleagues. One of the biggest issues we had was that legislation that would be passed here would be rural-proofed. Rural-proofing is anything outside the Pale. Lest people think I am anti-Dublin, I am not. I am just saying some bit of balance must be brought into the equation. We have all kinds of public services here. We even have the new Luas that the Minister and his team have designed but it cannot cross O'Connell Bridge. Dublin has more public transport than can fit in the city. Send a small bit down to us and we will make plenty of room for buses and trains. Let us have some constitutional fairness in the legislation we pass here. Under the Constitution, we are supposed to treat all people equally but it looks very much like some of us are less equal than others. This legislation and other legislation passed by other Ministers, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, is very regressive and anti-rural Ireland. I will have time to speak on the amendments. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his forbearance.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	As I said last night, it would have been preferable if this was included on Second Stage and we dealt with it at committee level but, obviously, the process is required because there is a need to make sure this set of amendments were legally sound. We had patience with that because of the origin of this issue. This is not something that was dreamt up because people were looking for something to do. This set of amendments was prompted by very tragic and real circumstances in which people found themselves, ironically in rural Ireland. I think most people know them as the Clancy amendments. They are called that for a particular reason because a woman and her daughter lost their lives. The inquest recommended that this precise legislation be enacted to prevent, as far as we can prevent, the same set of circumstances arising again. I was here last night and the one thing that was not terribly obvious in the commentary last night, and tonight, is that this aspect is being taken seriously. I heard someone say last night that it was perfectly fine to down a couple of pints and then get into a car. I thought we had gone beyond that. In the past three years, 47 learner drivers have been involved in fatal crashes. This is not a made-up number. A recent edition of "Prime Time" told us that 5.8% of fatal collisions involve a learner driver. We want to keep learner drivers safe but we also want to keep the roads safe. Even though this sometimes requires denying people a freedom they may well feel they should have, it is being done for a good reason. The programme spoke to a man called Alec Lee whose 17 year old daughter, Carol, was killed in Tipperary in 2000. He talked about how heartbroken he is and how senseless the loss of her life was - that was in County Tipperary. I have listened to Deputy Mattie McGrath at length and he did not refer to that aspect of it at all. This is the reason we are dealing with this set of amendments. It has not been dreamed up out of thin air. It is backed by the RSA, which is not just a quango sitting somewhere trying to find things to do. It gathers information on road traffic accidents that involve a fatality or serious injury. It maps those and goes into the detail of the circumstances of each accident with An Garda Síochána, such as whether it was a wet or dry day, what the junction was like, if a junction was involved, the side of the vehicle that was impacted and what other vehicles were involved. It gathers quite a sizeable amount of information. From that, it makes recommendations as to how we can make our roads safer and reduce the number of fatalities. This is how it should be. Before the RSA existed, the local authorities used to do that and I remember the forms that had to be filled in. There must have been 100 questions on them. A great deal of information is available to the RSA. When asked for its opinion, the AA raised concerns over how the law would be enforced, which is a valid point. It also stated that it was absolutely and demonstratively true and provable by any road data internationally that it is unsafe for learner drivers to be on the road unaccompanied. That comes from a motoring organisation that has a body of information gathered over decades, not just in Ireland but internationally. The RSA has stated that 5.8% of all fatal crashes between 2014 and 2017 involved a learner driver. That is less than the number of learner drivers on the road, which is 9%. The RSA recommends this. I am inclined to look at the evidence. There is considerable evidence indicating that it makes roads safer. Somebody who has been involved in a collision that has caused serious harm or death to another person has to carry that for his or her life, as do the family. There is shame associated with that. Therefore, there are injuries beyond those who are directly impacted. I was here last night when there was quite a large crowd in the Gallery for a debate on community employment schemes. However, in the middle of that group, was a group of people who have lost family members. The lack of sensitivity in the debate was deplorable. They got that awful knock on the door. They have to live without the person or people in their families who were very central to their families. We are trying to stop that happening to other families. That is why this amendment deserves to be supported. The evidence reinforces what is being proposed here. While most of my constituency is urban, parts of it are quite rural. While there is a difficulty for people to get to and from work etc., I do not think people want to do that at the expense of causing the kind of carnage that has been caused to families who have got that knock on the door. I will confine my remarks to this section which is about widening the scope of the Bill. It is important to make the point that this is not frivolous legislation that was dreamt up by some official who had nothing to do with his or her time, backed up by the RSA, who is doing it for the sake of doing it. There are solid reasons for doing it. For that reason, I believe it should be supported.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	Deputy Catherine Murphy has eloquently explained the rationale for the amendment and there is no need to rehearse that. I may be getting ahead of myself. The Minister proposes to repeal section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 2016, which states:(1) It shall be an offence for the owner of a vehicle to allow their vehicle to be driven by a learner driver driving unaccompanied.(2) Where a person charged with an offence under this section is the owner of the vehicle, it shall be a good defence to the charge for the person to show that the vehicle was being used without his consent and either that he had taken all reasonable precautions to prevent its being used or that it was being used by his servant acting in contravention of his orders.(3) Where a person is guilty of an offence under this section and disregarding any disqualification that may be capable of being imposed, such person shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,000 or a term not exceeding six months imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment.Am I right in saying the current legislation provides for a penalty for learner drivers driving unaccompanied and that the Minister is proposing as part of the extension of the original Bill to see that existing provision repealed and a new section inserted in its place? I ask the Minister to clarify that when he replies. How many prosecutions have taken place under the existing legislation? What do the officials who drafted the legislation feel constitute "all reasonable precautions"? While I do not agree with everything Deputy Mattie McGrath has said, if this legislation is enacted and becomes law, as appears likely, I agree on the urgent need for the Minister to deal with the long waiting list for people awaiting a driving test. I have obtained figures - Deputy Munster cited figures yesterday - showing that in some instances it takes in excess of 28 weeks for someone to get a test. That is certainly not fair and not appropriate. We should consider having a maximum time limit. The RSA must provide a deadline, for example two weeks or four weeks, within which somebody will be offered a test. That will help prevent people falling victim of this new penalty. While I did not see it, I believe a programme was broadcast the other night showing how some people are manipulating the test process. They are applying for a test in order to extend their provisional licences. They do not turn up for the tests and are getting a bye - for want of a better word - allowing them to extend their licences. That is not right and not fair on the people who are genuinely waiting to have their driving tests conducted because these people do not turn up which is a wasted opportunity. In addition they knowingly continue to drive on the road with a provisional licence without having passed the test. Irrespective of whether we care to admit it, everybody driving a bus, car or motorbike should have passed a test to certify them as fit to drive. I ask the Minister to clarify if the section 39 to be repealed is being replaced with a new amendment and, if that is the case, we can talk to that amendment as we go through Report Stage.

There is no question but that amendment No. 29, which the Minister has tabled, is a comprehensive attempt to finally address the issue of unaccompanied drivers. It is a couple of years since a former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, gave me information on the number of fatal and serious injury collisions involving unaccompanied drivers from 2012 to November 2016. In 2012 there were seven fatal and 22 serious collisions; in 2013, there were four fatal and ten serious collisions; in 2014, there were eight fatal and 32 serious collisions and in 2015, there were 16 fatal and 24 serious collisions. Up to that time in 2016, in October or November, there had been seven fatal and 24 serious collisions. A total of 49 people have died on our roads this year up to last Monday. If in any other area of transport there were 160 or 170 deaths in a single incident, there would be a major investigation and public inquiry. Due to the nature of road traffic crashes, with one or two people being killed or injured week after week, we in this House do not take the number so seriously. There are people in the Visitors Gallery tonight who have suffered at the hands of unaccompanied drivers, the subject of the Clancy amendment or section 39 of the 2016 Act, including the representatives of Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care, Ms Susan Gray and her son Steven, who lost a husband and father due to a crash involving an unaccompanied learner driver. I also welcome Fiona and Noel Clancy, as well as Louise Doyle. Alec Lee cannot be with us tonight. I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that the tenor of the debate last night was disrespectful to the families who have suffered and the tens of thousands of victims of road traffic crashes. It is incumbent on some of those who spoke to remember the incredibly sensitive nature of what has happened and which has traumatised families. These main amendments, and others that Deputy Troy tabled but which seem to have been ruled out of order, seek to remedy an intolerable situation and to try to bring that suffering to an end. Steven Gray was outside this House when he was a little boy asking us to address this issue and here we are finally in 2018 on the cusp, I hope, of doing that.  I listened at great length last night to our colleagues representing Kerry and Tipperary. I know south Kerry fairly well, as the Deputies Healy-Rae know. They mentioned the closure of The Shebeen, the famous pub in Lauragh. I thought also of Bunaw in Kilmakilloge, where Teddy O’Sullivan's bar, a good local hostelry, is still going strong. Rural life is continuing. The bottom line, however, is that 81% of road fatalities are in rural Ireland. Drink-driving is an issue for rural Ireland that we must address. I have always been very sympathetic to supported public transport for rural Ireland. One can take too dismal a view of the situation. I am also familiar with Deputy Mattie McGrath's constituency, having been a couple of times camped in the great town of Clonmel during famous by-elections when I was canvassing for my former party.  The arguments for the 50 mg to 80 mg drink-driving level are pretty overwhelming. Many of the studies we have seen show that people's capacity starts to decline after 20 mg. International studies are pretty conclusive on the point that having drink taken, when one's senses are impaired, is a serious deficiency in respect of operating machinery such as a car. That there are 180 arrests every week for drink driving bears out the fact that we must seek to address this issue. That is why it is right that we have recommitted this Bill to address the key elements that have not been addressed by this House and the Government. We should proceed with the business and go through these amendments as quickly as we can.

Further difficulties will be inflicted on the people who live in rural Ireland if the Bill is passed in its current form. When I entered the discussions on the programme for Government - and I stayed quite a long time, maybe until the evening before the Government was formed - the Minister was involved too, there was an agreement that the Government would introduce rural-proofing. The last Government was absolutely hammered in rural Ireland and it was obvious that was because it turned its back on it. The promise then was that to try to appease several rural Deputies, it would rural-proof all policies coming before the people in future. I did not believe it and that is why I did not support the Government. Thankfully my judgment was right, although it may not always be. When I discussed this Bill before Christmas, I asked the Minister what rural-proofing was put in place and he had no answer. He said he spoke to the Irish Farmers Association and a few others. I did not ask him to whom he spoke. He spoke to me and to the country. What did he put in place to try to at least alleviate the difficulties this Bill is going to cause for people who live in rural Ireland? Deputy Broughan says rural Ireland is going strong. He is in Dublin and I would be very slow to tell him how things are going in Dublin because I would not be fully sure of how they are. I certainly know how they are going in rural Ireland because I come from west Cork. I am proud of where I come from. I am proud to stand here and tell the Minister how people feel about this Bill because I have spoken to them. I took time out during the previous discussions to make sure, in case I was taking the wrong direction. We are human, we can make mistakes but I have not met anybody who told me I was wrong on this issue. They ask why this Bill is going through in its current form and now the Minister is criminalising parents.Where is the Minister going? In the name of God, what has possessed him? What is wrong? He spoke to me before I ever entered Dáil Éireann and asked me to consider joining his party. I spoke to him about rural issues and he agreed with me that they needed to be tackled. He did not agree with me that he would further complicate matters and further ruin people's lives in rural Ireland. Why did he not explain that to me? I have met people that the Minister has met recently and is going to meet, throughout Munster in particular, about joining his party. Excuse me, the Minister is in a group, not a party. I asked them what they think and they are not impressed. It is over as far as they are concerned. Anyway, the Minister can go ahead and meet them. He met me and thankfully I did not join his party. I would be like more of them, drifting away now one by one. The Minister has turned his back on the people here. He did not rural-proof this Bill. I have no intention of standing up here and criticising him only I am telling the truth and talking on behalf of the people I love. They are the people I represent in west Cork. There might be a few of them who support the Minister but they certainly are not coming to me. I do not see the Deputies in government here supporting the Minister at any time. When this Bill has been discussed, the Government benches have been empty the whole time. Down deep, they do not agree with the Minister. They have to toe the line because they want to stay in government. They are not here. If they were, they would be sitting behind the Minister. I do not expect to have a full House but at least some of them could be here. The Minister may continue on because he is determined in what he is doing. Why did he not look at how we could alleviate the situation with young people and driving licences? I come from a very rural community and there is no public transport as such. There is a bus in the morning and one in the evening. The car has to be the means of transport. I have a load of young people including members of my own family who want to have a driving test. They cannot have one. Why did the Minister not at least solve the driving test issue, so that people could book a driving test and know they would have it within a month or two? He did not do so because he had no intention of rural-proofing the Bill. He did not proof it at all. He came up with an idea and here he is floating it. He is criminalising good, hard-working parents who are in a very difficult situation. They are trying to work. By God, it is difficult to survive, whether in rural or urban areas. The Minister is treating them like criminals when it is quite questionable what he is at. He did proof this or intend to try to resolve one issue before moving on. Could the Minister have looked at having speed limiters fitted in cars that young people are driving? Perhaps that was the road he should have travelled. We would all be quite understanding of that. No, that was not to be thought of. We will do it the heavy-handed way. As Deputy Troy said a while ago, there is a law there already. How many people have been brought before the courts in respect of that law? That is an important question and the Minister might answer it later. According to him, quite a lot of people are breaking the law so we need to find out how many have been brought before the courts. The Minister has taken the easy way out. Too many collar-and-tie boys, pencil pushers may have been driving him along. The Minister has turned his back on areas where he could have helped to save lives. He should look at the appalling condition of our roads. They are in a dreadful state. I brought the Minister down to west Cork last year and he visited eight projects. All eight groups are still waiting for a response and they have not got that yet. I cannot chance taking him down any more. One of the roads he did travel was between Ballydehob and Bantry. I was in the car with him and we got a fair tossing. Not one thing has happened to that road since he sat in that car and the back of it walloped off the ground. I know the Minister cannot be responsible for every pothole in Ireland but he certainly was inside that car. To think I was talking to a gentleman the other day who goes to work every morning and said that if he does not travel on the other side of that road, the tools in the back of his van will end up in the front. That is the N71 road and it is in such an appalling condition that it should be closed. If there was any understanding of health and safety, that road should be closed officially to traffic. No, it is open. If it was a young person driving unaccompanied, the parents would face jail, but there is no-one going to face anything here. They can be tossed off the road, two or three can be killed, move on, so what? The same happened before. During Storm Ophelia, trees killed three people. Was there any report from the Minister's office? I mentioned it a number of years back in the council. I said there should be a report drawn up by each local authority about roadside trees. I mentioned it several times in this Chamber. I have not heard the Minister saying it is a serious issue. Let us bring that before the House in a road traffic Bill and I will support the Minister. I know it would help save lives. Sadly, that is not the case. It is only a few lives. It does not sell newspapers or give people a chance to fill out their columns about what they are doing and what they are not doing.  When he was a Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív brought in provisions about the night-time bus service. Some people called it the booze bus and they all call it different things. Actually that was what I call rural-proofing. Why did the Minister not bring in something like that so that people would be collected from the public house at night? There would be funding set aside for that. That would have been a move in some direction in respect of tackling this issue. From start to finish, the whole thing lacked any bit of rural-proofing. I do not think rural Ireland is in the Minister's brief. If it is, I certainly would like to see it. What has the Minister done in this Bill that will help create an easier life and not put extra stress on people who are already stressed to the very limit? Our young people are reaching the age of driving and there is no public transport service. By God, if we want to pay for a public transport service in rural Ireland we know what we will pay and young people cannot afford it. They are trying to work hard by night and at weekends. They are trying to pay for their college and begging their parents to work with them to try and get a car. It is just the ordinary basic moves for a young person growing up. Their parents are paying €4,000 or €5,000 for insurance and maybe €2,000 for a car. The Minister puts this Bill in front of them to criminalise them, just in case he has not punished them enough and the Government has not got them cornered enough in rural Ireland. It will chase them out of there one way or the other. How can anyone consider putting a parent in jail for trying to help his or her child? I urge the Minister to think again. I ask him to step back from this. A lot of Ministers and politicians are famous for a lot of things in their time but I do not think he will want to be famous for what is going on here. I am only talking on behalf of the people of west Cork. I certainly do not have anyone in my offices telling me that the Minister is right in the move he is making or that they are delighted with him. Absolutely not. They are telling me to stand up and are giving out to me, even though I told them there is no more I can do. They are telling me I am not doing enough and that I should get the Minister out of office straight away. I say I cannot but that is the view of the people of west Cork. I bring their views to the floor of Dáil Éireann and am proud to do so. The Minister must find money for our roads. I do not like a situation where a beautiful village like Leap is full of holes or where in a beautiful village like Drimoleague in west Cork I could lose part of my wheel because of holes in the road. I tried to show the Minister the road between Rosscarbery and Clonakilty.Perhaps 20 or 30 trees fell across that road during the storm. Thank God nobody was killed. The back of my car slipped on that road recently, and I had four good tyres under it. Nothing is happening. People are frustrated with the amount of driving they have to do. They are spending hours in cars travelling through west Cork. It should be the same as travelling into Dublin, where there are beautiful passing bays and flyovers. We should not be treated like second class citizens. As long as I am in Dáil Éireann I will raise these issues, and I assure the Minister that the people of rural Ireland will never forget him because of this Bill. Any poor, unfortunate Deputy sitting with him will be thought of in the same way.  I ask the Minister again to rural proof this Bill. He should go back to the drawing board and sit down with the people who know how people are suffering in rural Ireland, who know the pain that is out there and the difficulties people are facing. He should not further their difficulties but rather work through the issues with those people. There certainly have to be controls, but people should not be threatened with jail sentences on this issue. That is what the Minister has done. I will stand by rural Ireland for as long as I am here. I do not like it when Deputies from Dublin tell me that rural Ireland is going strong. They should come down and look at The Bridge Bar in Ballylickey, which closed with the loss of ten jobs only a couple of months ago, thanks to the Minister. The lady who ran the pub had a bus to take her customers home every night to make sure that none of them drove. They could not even drive the next morning. She said they could not go to mass on a Sunday morning with the worry. She shut her doors, and many more premises have been shut in west Cork in recent times. Rural Ireland is not going well. It is going through a very difficult period. It needs assistance and help. It does not need further condemnation, criminalisation and finger pointing. The Minister must stop the pencil pushers from the top from telling people in rural Ireland how to live their lives. He should look at the Constitution and stand by it. If not, he should stand down.

It has been drawn up by the Road Safety Authority, as I understand it, working together with the Minister. I have dealt with some of the Minister's officials on other issues and I must compliment them on that. I listened to the radio today on my way here, and I heard about people who are running men's sheds around the country which are struggling for funding. The men's sheds might have offered people some hope, but with this Bill they will be unable to get to them. They have nowhere to go now. Deputies have been throwing mud at people across the floor of this House. We all sympathise with people who have lost their lives on the roads, but the statistics show that many of the drivers in question were two, three or four times over the limit. The statistics speak for themselves. It is sad to say, to a person who is supposed to be an Independent Deputy as well as a Minister, that the Minister has single-handedly achieved this over the last two years. The workers in rural Ireland will be moving on, because while there might be cranes almost hitting each other in Dublin, there are no cranes to be seen in the skies of rural Ireland. In my part of the world, and in the places the Deputies across the floor of the House come from, the options for people are the boat or the plane. That is the scenario in parts of rural Ireland. We hear of an upswing, and in parts of the country that is true. However, pubs are closing. There was a so-called deal for postmasters, where the Government did not force them to close but left them with very little choice, and which pinpointed who is going to get the money to buy out the post offices. Neighbours and the community will blame the postmaster for leaving in that situation, while some post offices outside that scheme will continue to operate. It is cute-hoorism and good PR. The people have been sold a pup once more. The Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, is also being sold a pup.  There is a real problem with health across Ireland. One might hear people giving out about the HSE, among other things, but for some reason, whatever type of magic he is able to conjure, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is able to avoid the criticism. However, we hear day in and day out about the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and what he is doing to rural Ireland. It is easy in Dublin to get a bus until at least 12 o'clock at night, or a taxi at any hour of the night. There are not too many taxis around on the byroads of rural Ireland. A kite was flown in the media that the Government might give a rebate on the vehicle road tax to publicans to make them feel good. Another kite was flown then which suggested that 33 or 35 buses would be provided. That would not even provide a bus for every council area, when one considers that there are parts of Dublin that are rural as well. This will amount to nothing but promises; the legislation will go through and that will be the end of it.  In parts of rural Ireland there are daycare centres for people who suffer from mental illness which are being closed. There is a constant pressure on such resources. I have just come from the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, where the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, was speaking. In fairness to him, Deputy Ring has probably the smallest budget and is looking after the biggest part of the country. He listened to us. He is anxious to get more money.  Deputy Michael Collins pointed out that the roads are in a terrible state at the moment. How many accidents are caused by the state of our roads? Has more funding gone into fixing the problem? A few percent every year, perhaps. Most councils have 40% less funding now than they had in 2008 or 2009. Accidents are happening because of the state of our roads, but nothing is being done about it. There is a Bill with the Department seeking to help parts of Galway which were damaged by the storm. It caused damage to the seashore and flooding problems. The people there have received no money. It is fine to talk about it, but the attitude seems to be that those people should be left out because they are out in the sticks and do not matter. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would not be too bothered if those people fell into the sea. Rural Ireland seems to be neglected.  People earn less than the average industrial wage in rural Ireland. Farmers earn €18,000 to €20,000. I am not saying that people need to be earning mega money to live in rural Ireland; it is obviously cheaper to build a house there. These people, however, are struggling. When they have families they try to provide education for their children to ensure that Ireland will be a better place and that their children will have a better life. They cannot afford the €9,000 that I heard one college campus is increasing it to. They cannot afford to have the luxuries that some have. The get-out on that was that these people decided to buy a car for their children and they tried to insure it at an astronomical rate. When they talked about accidents and young people, I proposed something that would solve much of that but neither the RSA nor anybody else would listen. Anyone who is familiar with lorries and has driven them over the years would know they have what is called a "speedo" which regulates the speed the driver can go. I wanted them to give those youngsters the opportunity to get insurance at the same rate as anybody else but to put a restriction on the speed they could drive at which would make it safer both for them and for other road users. If one talks to mechanics about the new types of cars, they will say this can be done through the computer to ensure the facility is available. However, we are not bothered about that. It might be trouble and would not be a good thing to bring down the cost of their insurance, I suppose. Therefore, the best thing we can do is crucify their mothers and fathers who bought that little car and taxed and insured it. We tell them that if the youngster is caught on the road, we will confiscate the car and the owner will be banged up for a while. Make a criminal out of them - that is the stuff. That is the way to treat Irish people, the good, decent people who work, have a normal life, do not break laws, do the best they can and try to rear youngsters and give them a better life then they had. However, every step of the way, we try to put a wall in front of them, we try to make sure we make bigger criminals out of them than the people who are criminals. It is a sad Ireland when we look at some of the stuff that is coming in and the way we are heading. It makes me wonder at times where we are going as a country. Those youngsters are going to college. From where I live they can go to Athlone college. Is there a bus? No, there is not. Is there accommodation? No, there is not. Mammy and Daddy, as well as trying to survive, will have to drive them up and down the road. The sad part is that when people look at rural Ireland, they will say there is a bus from Athlone to Roscommon, and one to Ballinasloe. However, is there one going to Creggs, Ballymoe, Athleague or places like that? No. It is the same in the south. These youngsters do not fly so someone has to pick them up. An understanding is required of the problems and obstacles put in front of people living in those areas. Do we deprive these youngsters of an education? Through blood, sweat and tears their mothers and fathers will do everything they can for them, although, my God, the State is trying to make sure they will have to do what their predecessors did in many parts, in particular the west, that is, take the plane or the boat and go. Are we proud of that, as public representatives or as a nation? I proposed two amendments to the Bill. The State is great at telling people it will bang them up in jail, fine them, confiscate the vehicle and do the devil and all. However, has the State a responsibility for anything? Has the State a responsibility to make sure some youngster who wants a driving test can get one within a minimum of six weeks? If the State is not able to do that, in my opinion the State has failed. I have looked at the records concerning driving testers, which are abysmal. There were parliamentary questions on this issue and the devil and all was going to be done. Was it done? The current statistics show the waiting lists in different parts of the country are phenomenal. Are we going to step back and decide that if we, as a State, are not able to do this, we are not going to crucify someone without giving them a chance? Another proposal I raised fell on deaf ears. There are places like Mondello Park where a machine driver driving different types of equipment can do an intensive course and get a certificate to ensure the driver is safe and can then do the test after that. A system like that would be too easy. This is the type of thinking outside the box we need. It was the same with the regulations on towing a trailer behind a car. If drivers had the test before a certain date, they could back a trailer anywhere, but if it was after that date, they had to jump into the back of a lorry and press a button 35 times and, afterwards, get so many lessons. On top of that, we had to make sure we robbed people in order to give them a piece of paper for a trailer they had been towing for 20 years before that. That is good, fair thinking. That is a real progressive State. What signal are we sending to these youngsters? Are we sending them an obstacle course or are we going to give them encouragement? Is there anything wrong with having places in the east, west, north and south of the country where they could go for a two-day intensive course to get them on the road and to make sure they are safe, and then to guarantee them a test within six weeks? However, we do not want to do that. We want to turn them around and tell them that if they are caught on the road, they will not have their licence - we promise them that - daddy and mammy will face a judge and probably end up in the jail and, by the way, they will not have the car either because we will confiscate it, and we will fine them good and heavy. The military state and heavy-handedness - that is the way to bring people forward. It is a sad thing to say but some of the ways we are going about this are disgusting. The Minister should do this by encouraging people, not by the heavy hand. He should make sure he brings people with him, especially youngsters. I watch them week in, week out, and the way they behave and operate is a credit to them. We should be there to help them and give them every opportunity we can. As was said earlier in regard to pubs, it all kicks back the following morning. I got a text this morning that the traffic corps was in a certain spot. They are doing their job and I am not saying there is anything wrong with them being there. The problem is that a lot of the understanding is gone. In England if a lorry travelling up one of the motorways has a crack in the spring - the Acting Chairman will know what I am talking about - the driver will be given 14 days to fix it. Here, the law would make sure to put €750 of a problem on top of that, with penalty points and everything else. I can promise that a crack in a spring, with ten leaks, would never do any harm, and I drove them as much as anybody. That is the way we have gone. We seem to bring things in without understanding them. I spoke to a person who hauls cattle. They took the commercial vehicle test. Two minor issues arose, but everything else was sound. There was no serious defect. However, because the test had been failed and he had to pick up a load of cattle, he had to rent a low loader in Limerick and spend €700 or €800. The way we go about this really frustrates me. We need to encourage people. Everyone is for safety. Nobody wants to see anybody getting hurt or killed, but there is a sense of aggression in the way that some measures are brought in. The frustration people experience and the hopelessness in the faces of people who are struggling is what is intolerable about this. Whoever wrote some of this stuff should go out and spend a while in the areas it is affecting. That applies to the quality of the roads too. One must live in an area to know its needs, and unfortunately a lot of our Departments are based in the middle of a city. While they might understand the M50 and its problems, and the different roads leading out of Dublin, when one goes north, south east or west it is different. These people try to make a living. They are part of Ireland. They are part of an economy. Most of them are reliant on driving, for the simple reason that a lot of them drive 40 or 50 miles to work. That is because there is no bus or train. In some of these areas there are not even taxis. Before sanctions are introduced, in my view, solutions must be brought in to facilitate change. We must try to make sure that people can still do their work and can get from A to B. One of the Deputies who spoke yesterday evening spoke about a young apprentice who had to give up work. A lot of people do not understand the implications of something that stops people from getting to work, because of changes in the rules around learner drivers or because a mother and father are under threat of confiscation of a car, jail or fines. What happens to most of those affected? They have two choices. They can head for Dublin, where they will not get a bed. Or unfortunately, most of them head for London or Canada. Then we read stories years later; we think we are great Irish patriots, celebrating St. Patrick's Day in England and other countries. At the same time, it is us and our generation that might have hounded them all out.  Unfortunately, during the recession we lost 250,000 of them because of bad practices. We are now driving more out, though they are doing their level best. Some of these parents have a mortgage. They are doing their best. They might have one or two children going to college. The Minister knows as well as I do what the fees in the large cities are like. Certainly the likes of Athlone Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology, Sligo have great facilities. There are facilities in Galway and for people living in other parts of the country. It is fine for someone living in Drumcondra. They can shoot up the road. They can nearly walk to college. That is great. However, some of these people are 40 or 50 miles from the nearest places to go to school.  A lot of people are afraid to open their mouth about Bills at this stage. People need to understand that everyone is for safety. Everyone sympathises with anybody that has lost a loved one. However, we need to look at the statistical facts. We need to look at what are the reasons for accidents. We need to know that in the cases of over 60% of people who have accidents, absolutely no drinking was involved. We also need to know that most - I think it is 95% of accidents - are caused by driver error. No-one tolerates that. I am not tolerating that. This started off as one Bill, and like a rolling stone it is gathering bits on the way. A provision about learner drivers has now been thrown into it.  The Minister needs to take a step back and look at where he is going. I fear for the obstacles that are put in front of youngsters in rural parts of Ireland. I will ask the Minister for one thing. I have tabled this request as an amendment. I know the Government is moving an amendment so that cars are not confiscated. I want clarity on something. Does the amendment provide that if the authorities cannot give people a test within six weeks, the car will not be confiscated and the mother and father will not be liable for any prosecution? I have read the amendment that the Government has tabled. I am open to correction, but by my reading it appears only to address the concern about confiscation. I am open to clarification on that. We need to be fair to people. While we are bringing in laws on one side, we need to make sure that on the other side the State meets its obligation to make sure that those people are provided for.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	448	I would like to very sincerely thank Deputy Eamon Ryan for facilitating me in speaking before him, because I have an engagement scheduled that I cannot get out of. I just wanted to provide an update following the contribution I made on this Bill last night. I suppose every person in this Chamber is busy and has a lot to do. Definitely when a person is a Minister he or she an extra workload arising from that portfolio. I must admit, however, that having received so many emails and text messages, and hearing from people in all the different ways they can make contact, I never realised until today that people listen to so much of what goes on here in the Dáil. What I am getting to is that whatever I said here last night, I got a reaction not only from County Kerry but from all over the country. People say that what I said was correct, and that the arguments that I made were reasonable and plausible, not outlandish or outrageous. The reason I am on my feet is to relay what the messages say: that the Minister should look at what is being proposed again. I am awfully conscious of this. There are other things going on in rural Ireland for which the Minister could never be blamed. In no way could they be placed at the door of the Minister. There are other issues that were there before him, and there would be problems there if he never became the Minister. However, what he is doing in this legislation is compounding a problem that is already there. That is what people have been saying to me all day. I only came down from my office to take the opportunity to give this message. The amount of messages I have received is absolutely frightening. As I say they do not just come from County Kerry, but from all over this country. People tell me for God's sake to keep doing what I am doing. They mean the people who stood up here last night, on our own, including Deputy Mattie McGrath. There were six people who stood last night looking to have a vote. We were let down by the major parties.We were assisted by some Independent Deputies and let down by many others, including some whom we helped previously. When they wanted help and assistance, we did not let them down but they let us down last night. My eyes were opened today when I saw the reaction and realised a massive swell of people are worried about the future. They are concerned that this legislation will drag us into a place we do not want to be, namely, one in which young people will not want to live because of the terror caused by what will be needed to learn to be a driver and go out on the road. A perfectly sensible and law-abiding person who goes out and has a couple of pints, arranges transport home and needs to get up in the morning for work will also feel terror about failing a breath test the following morning because he or she may have drunk a small amount of alcohol the previous night. These are the worries and concerns people have. Our pleas may be falling on deaf ears but I would like to think they are not. I would like to think a certain person will realise there is a great deal of concern.  The one group of people who are not listening is other Deputies in this Chamber. I was brought up not to be critical. If I cannot say something good about another politician, I will seldom say something bad about him or her. I see other politicians who were elected by fine, honest-to-God people who are now completely ignoring those who sent them here to do a job. All around the Houses, Deputies who were elected to speak up for their constituents are now silent and are not present in the Chamber for this debate. Those who were here for last night's debate did not stand up to facilitate a vote and refused to do so when asked. Upon my soul, if they were standing up and I asked them to sit down, they would not do so, but they would not stand up for us last night. It does not make sense for them to ignore their electorate because people have a funny way of answering back. The electorate have the power to deny people the right to come to the Dáil. Some rural Deputies sent to the Dáil with a mandate to stand up for our way of life in rural Ireland are ignoring that mandate and being led by blind pipers. They are ignoring what is important, namely, the mandate given to them.  Many people are angry, upset and worried. The timing of this Bill is ironic. I have the exact figure on the number of postmasters and postmistresses in County Kerry who have been thanked by An Post for their services and told the company would be happy if they took a package and closed their doors.

They are being offered an incentive to shut post offices. Why am I mentioning post offices in a debate on a road traffic Bill? The Acting Chairman could try to shut me down on this issue but it is one that is closely related to the Bill because it is related to rural Ireland and keeping people living in rural areas. If one wants to live in a rural area, one cannot stay in a house or yard all the time. One has to move around every day to live, earn a wage, secure gainful employment, get an education or get on in the world. People in rural areas want to move around just as people in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and other places where various modes of transport are available want to move around. I never begrudged people in the cities anything. Did I ever criticise the billions of euro being spent in Dublin or argue that we wanted the same to apply in the rest of the country? No, but we would like basic infrastructure, including roads of an acceptable standard, train and airport services and buses to take elderly people to shops and collect their pensions and to take children to school. What we do not want is to have people attacking us. People in rural Ireland feel as if we are under attack. When I refer to rural Ireland, I am not referring only to the countryside but also places such as Killorglin, Killarney and Kenmare. Others will argue that these towns are built-up areas but they are far from the main cities, airports and centres of employment. We need to survive, which means we must stand up for ourselves and we need to have politicians who will stand up in the Dáil and speak on behalf of the people.  It is sad when one looks at the big parties to see that Fine Gael is sound asleep and Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and all the rest seem to be blindly rowing in behind the Minister. It is shocking and beyond belief. Previous generations of politicians from these parties who have gone to their reward fought for rural Ireland. They would have had a boxing match over rural Ireland and would not have backed down from a row. There was many a good boxing match during elections and maybe it was no harm when one looks back on it. It was the way of life at the time and no one was seriously hurt in any case. They always fought their corner because they were fighters and they had to be a fighter to survive. In this world, one has to fight every day to survive and keep one's head above water.  When I speak of "we", I am referring to a small group of Deputies who are rebelling against this Bill and what it stands for. This legislation will not be the end of the story. People will see that the Government can get away with this. When the Minister and I are no longer here, other Ministers will conclude that because the Minister, Deputy Ross, got away with this legislation, they will be able to get away with doing something else. Where will it stop? We are asking that somebody listen to common sense. Last night, I made a fair point, one which many people picked up on today, namely, that a Minister, long before any of us were elected to the Dáil, thought it was a great idea to do away with the rural rail network. That was a monumental error. Politicians from the party to which the Minister in question belonged are the first to admit today that the closure of the rural rail network was a mistake. It is too late when the horse has bolted, the legislation has been enacted and the changes have been made. If the legislation proceeds as proposed, there will be no going back and matters will only get worse. Last night, I neglected to speak about a specific group of people, namely, publicans. I have to declare an interest, as I always do when I speak about matters such as this. I have a brother who is a publican and who, subsequent to my father, has run a respectable house. Every publican I know runs what I call a respectable house where he or she will refuse to serve a person who has had a drink too many. There is an automatic barrier or lawmaker in the pub, namely, the man or woman dispensing the drink. Publicans are the guards and adjudicators of what is right and wrong. They want to run respectable houses and hold on to their licences. They do not want to sully their excellent reputation for providing a service and they have never done so. All the publicans I have had the pleasure of knowing and dealing with over the years have run impeccable premises. This means people can say they never hurt anybody or allowed a person to leave their pubs and get into a car when they were not fit to drive.They never let a row start inside a pub which they did not stop themselves. They never let something happen outside the door of their public house because they felt responsible and were the law-makers keeping public order at all times. When one sees the culture of drinking now where the publican is being removed from the picture, a person can buy a bag of drink where there is no measure and no dispensing. Whereas a shot of Paddy in a public house is a measured amount and whereas a publican will monitor how much a person is drinking, when someone has bought drink in an off-licence and drinks in a private house, the serving can be an entire glass. That is why one sees so many fights and murders late on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights in such circumstances as people overindulge in the absence of such a thing as a measure. There is no such thing as a monitor. The guardian of the measure of the drink is gone. Being a proper publican is a vocation. It is like a trade. Publicans are dedicated to their service. When we lose them and the door of the pub closes, a whole way of life is lost. The younger generation coming up, who might have kept the door open, do not have that opportunity because their parents had to close the pub. Why did they have to close it? It is because of Governments and Government decisions. It is very wrong. I am not a good person to travel because I do not like to go abroad. Any time I was outside Ireland and around Europe and I went into what is called a café bar, I experienced the most soulless, empty, cold, damp and depressing places into which any human being could ever have had the misfortune to go. They had plastic seats, plastic tables and all the horribleness that goes with them. I compare that to an Irish pub where the first thing that hits one when one goes in is a blast of heat from a fire or some other mechanism to keep the place warm. The first thing one will see is a friendly, smiling face behind the counter. One will meet nice people with stories to tell and conversations to have. We are losing all of that because of regulation and legislation like the Bill under discussion tonight. We speak here about mental illness and depression. One of the major causes of depression, isolation and upset in people's minds is the fact of people being on their own. I know people who go to the public houses in their communities and the last thing on their minds is a drink. What they want is to go in and talk about what they were doing that day whether it was farming, a trip to the mart or a visit to the creamery where they heard a funny story which they want to relate. There might have been a funeral and they may want to lament the passing of the person who is dead. Someone might be pregnant or a child may have been born and they might want to talk about that. They want to talk about what is going on in their community. It is a source of jollity for them with all of the blackguarding and honest-to-God ball-hopping about politics, football, courting and everything else that goes on. All of that will be lost. When it is gone, it is gone forever. During the recent spell of cold weather, many people were thanked for what they did and rightly so. I refer to fire brigade members, local authority workers, ambulance personnel and gardaí. One group of people who were not thanked but which was very important were our local publicans. People who had not been to their local pub for a long time went there in the ice and snow because they could walk to it. The publicans provided a great service and people had time to engage and have a bit of fun among themselves despite the bad weather. Where will they go if the pubs are closed in future? It is no exaggeration to talk about the number of pubs which have closed. At one time, Cahersiveen had 52 pubs. One could have gone to a different pub every week and been barred but not have had to try to get back in for 12 months. One can be sure that there are not 52 pubs there now. Killorglin had between 36 and 38 pubs at one time but it does not have them now. We are losing a great deal in towns and villages. What are we going to finish up with? Is it these horrible, soulless café bars about which I told the Minister earlier?

That is awful. It will be a sorrowful day for Ireland if that comes to pass. It would be very poor of me to fail to record that. I refer finally to our young people. What, in the name of God, will come of them if they cannot get the start? People say they should take lessons and pass the driving test. How can they pass the test when they cannot get called for the test? I thank the testers and instructors in Kerry and compliment them on the service they provide. However, they will be the first people to tell one that they need help. They need more resources and to be given the capacity to work longer hours for which they are compensated. The backlog is an emergency situation. Why should young people be told they are committing a criminal offence by driving without a full licence when they are being told on the other hand by another arm of the State they must go on a waiting list to do the driving test and will be called when they are called. That is not good enough. That is not acceptable. It is not young people's fault. All a young person wants to do is go to college and work and earn some money on a part-time basis. Young people need that money desperately. There are pressures on young people today that we did not experience when we were starting out. Every young person deserves the right to life in the first instance, which it is no harm to record again tonight, and the right to live that life then in the same way as the rest of us. That means they should get their driving licence when they want it and get on the road in their cars when they want to. Why should we criminalise them for doing that? That is compounded by the emergence of the fact that the person who owns the motor car could finish up as a common criminal. My goodness, where are we going? It is one thing to direct these comments to the Minister, Deputy Ross, but we must also talk about those who work in officialdom, who went along with all of this and who did not cry stop. That is wrong. There are excellent people working in the Department as I know because I deal with them a great deal. They have great ability. However, there are civil servants hiding among the mandarins of the Department who seem to think they can close their eyes to this rather than to express concern. There are two Irelands. These are, respectively, the places we represent, which have it tough and which struggle to survive, and the places that have everything at their fingertips. I do not want to go on too long. I thank Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party with which I do not always agree for doing me the courtesy of facilitating me tonight. I will repay the compliment sometime. I ask that what I have said is noted. If the Minister saw the number of contacts with me on foot of last night's debate, it would be frightening. It is hard to believe until one sees it. I will show him the number any time. If he saw what I did, he would note that, my God, there is a significant group of people out there who are extremely upset and worried by this Bill, what it contains, what it means for the future and what will come after it. That is the big question. Like last night, tonight will be remembered for a long time.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	453	I was happy to yield to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and listen to him. His question about what kind of place young people will want to live in is valid. It is the key question for all those in terms of what we are doing in the Dáil. It is as much an issue for urban Deputies as it is for rural Deputies. Politics is central to answering that question and getting it right, both in rural and urban Ireland. When somebody doubts the power or use of politics, asking what good it does, I always show some practical examples. The most important one for me is what has happened with the number of road deaths in this country over the past 40 years. In the mid-1970s, up to 500 people a year were killed on our roads. Everyone knows the utter tragedy and complete devastation for a family which suffers a fatality through a road accident. Last year, 159 people were killed on our roads. While it is 159 too many, it is significantly lower than the 500 some 40 years ago. Not all of this is down to politics. Much of it is due to road standards and regulations concerning safety belts, for example. However, even the introduction of the safety belt was a political decision. It took Ralph Nader in the United States to take on the power of General Motors, Ford and other car companies to insist they were not thinking safety when they built their cars. It was also due, over many years involving many parties, to political decisions around changing our laws on drink-driving and speed, as well as introducing measures in urban areas such as speed ramps and restrictions. Only last week, we introduced the new 30 km/h limit in Dublin. It has been a continuous slow and tortuous battle to address the tragedy in which 159 people die each year on our roads. It has taken political decisions and commitment, often unpopular decisions, for us to be able to do that. I am not happy, however, that we are doing enough. There was a protest tonight outside Leinster House organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. My first priority now would be creating safe spaces on our roads. Our whole system is completely antithetical to the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. For example, if we are going to complain about things, I will cite the fact the cycling budget for Dublin City Council was halved when the number of cycling fatalities doubled. I cannot understand why we are not putting money into cycling facilities in this and every other city. This is too sore an issue to speak about at this stage because a cyclist died last week in Dublin. However, not only would it protect people’s lives and improve safety but it would transform the urban environment in a way which would make Dublin thrive and be an incredible city in which to live. I know Deputy Michael Collins’s area in west Cork. I would also like to see priority given to ensuring a short time for people to get their driving tests in order they are not on the road as learner drivers for too long. We must encourage this and put resources into it. I wish such a measure was in this Bill. Like Deputies Michael Collins and Fitzmaurice, as well as others, I too would love to see a real transformation to ensure we have rural bus services. It is not impossible. Deputy Harty will know that in west Clare there were good community bus services. Although they were not perfect, they were experimental and were a good example of what could be done if resourced properly and we were ambitious enough to go the extra yard. Those sorts of initiatives should be at the centre of providing alternatives to having to drive. I have to accept the Minister, the Road Safety Authority and others have done the analysis and feel there is further room for tackling drink-driving. We have to support it. We cannot say we want all these other measures but we will not support the initiative in question. The Deputies from the Rural Independent Group claim this will have particular consequences for people in rural Ireland because they have to drive long distances and do not have a public transport alternative. This brings difficulties just like some of the other decisions over the past 40 years which helped us reduce road deaths. I still support it because politicians should be committed to bringing that figure down to zero. That should be our aim. To highlight how this is particularly a rural issue, the 159 people who died last year - God bless every one of them and their families - would fill this Chamber. If one includes the clerk and the parliamentary reporter - I apologise for including them in the proceedings – there are 159 of us in this Chamber, making it representative of that population. There are five Deputies from Kerry, each one of them welcome. However, eight people from Kerry died last year on our roads. There are five Deputies from Tipperary, but, similarly, eight people from Tipperary died on our roads. I do not know if Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice is the only Member from Roscommon, but four people from Roscommon were killed on our roads last year. There are five Deputies from Mayo but 12 people from Mayo died in traffic accidents last year. If one adds those four counties together, we would fill this entire section of the Chamber. This is an issue for rural Ireland that we have to address. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked how we can make rural Ireland a place where young people will want to live. We have the exact same question in urban Ireland. My 19-year-old son asked a simple question the other day. He asked me how much of a multiple of our income our house price was when I bought it back in 1997. It was three times my and my wife’s incomes. He asked what it would be today. We replied it would be eight times. Every young person in Dublin is asking how they can live in this city. That is a cutting crucial question for them. Similarly, I am terrified for my son’s safety when he is cycling around this city. How can we make it a safe place for him? The same question has to be asked for rural Ireland. I believe we need to go full steam in addressing that question to ensure young people in rural Ireland have accessibility. It also has to be safe. It was not that long ago that it felt safe to walk down a country road in rural Ireland. Increasingly, it does not today. Could we not set that ambition? Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that during the snow, people actually walked to the local pub. It was the same in Dublin and everywhere else around the country. With the snow, we instantly went back 50 years to the sense of community and connection to local small places because we were not dependent on the car and no one could drive. Can we not do that across all of Ireland, where it would be safe to walk down a country road?Maybe in every single town for as far as we can, we put in footpaths. Let us put the money into that because 30 pedestrians died last year, often on those dark country roads. Are we going to create an Ireland where a person cannot walk along a country road? Is that where we want to go or should we set a different objective whereby these are walking roads and we will make them safe by design? I listened to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae when he rightly noted that this issue is not only about the countryside but what happens to places such as Killorglin, Killarney and Kilgarvan or the other towns he mentioned. According to jar.ie, which I looked up while he was speaking, Killorglin has 14 pubs and a populations of 2,000. That is still a fair few. While Cahersiveen may have had 52 pubs in the past, according to my very quick research it now has a population of 1,168 and 23 pubs. Clonakilty with a population of 4,500 has 22 pubs. Let us look at which towns are working and why and how we can replicate that. I always use Clonakilty as an example because it is a town that is thriving. I like it as an example because it has its own mayor and I believe in restoring power back down to the local level. When a person does it in towns such as Clonakilty, it seems to work. They have 1,000 people working in the industrial estate there. The town is booming and I think that is partly because they have created an attractive urban centre which is very close to being pedestrianised. Killorglin is another town that I know that is very successful in having created a strong centre with all the vibrant pubs that go with it, because they bring life back to the centre. That is where I think young people will want to live. I was deeply critical of the national planning framework because ultimately it failed. While it set out with very good objectives, these were abandoned to the extent that it says that 50% of new accommodation will be outside of existing urban areas. How are we going to create a system where, as the Minister rightly advises, people will not drink and drive but at the same time we place people out in sprawl? I do not think that will work. We need to use this opportunity holistically. It is not a question of Dublin versus the rest. It is about building up Carrigaholt or Ennistymon, the fantastic towns with fantastic urban pub culture. That is where we need our young people to be. That is where we need families to be. People can walk or cycle to school or to the local shops, and probably to the local GP whose clinic is probably in the town centre, and they can walk to the pub. Accommodation is cheaper than it would be in Dublin. There are loads of jobs that we could develop if we did it in a co-ordinated way in sectors such as tourism, energy, including forestry, food production and digital services, if we can connect the broadband. We must have a vision for rural Ireland and urban Ireland which is sustainable in every way. Included in that vision would be that this is a country that takes road safety most seriously and that it is a safe place. As part of this, it should have vibrant public transport in rural and urban areas. There would be an expectation that kids cycle to school. The statistics around cycling in Ireland are heartbreaking. One that shook me some years ago showed that in County Monaghan, to use one county as an example, more girls were driving themselves to secondary school than were cycling. Every rural school should be trying to make it safe again for children to cycle to school. I think that is the type of place that young people will want to live and raise families, because of the freedom that allows. Parents do not have to worry that their son or daughter will be safe when they cycle to school. We should go with road safety in everything. It should be part of the vision for creating a vibrant rural Ireland and a vibrant and safe urban Ireland too. It is not impossible. In the past 40 years we have gone from 500 to 159 deaths. In going to zero we could create vibrant rural and urban communities which are socially successful and where people want to live as well as being safer places. That is why I support this Bill and was pleased to be able to contribute to the debate.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	The central part of this Bill is that it changes the penalty for the amount of alcohol a person can consume rather than the alcohol limits. Limits are there and they are important but they are being ignored and, as a result, drinking and driving is contributing to road deaths. I do not see it as an urban versus rural issue, nor merely an issue of pubs. It is a national issue. We should not create a situation where it is urban versus rural, which is too simplistic a view. The motivation behind the Bill is to save lives and avoid injury. It is important to bear in mind that multiples of the numbers who die on the roads are very seriously injured. It is an important point. We cannot just measure road safety by lives lost. It must be measured in those seriously injured as well. The Bill provides a measure of safety not only to drivers but also to their passengers and other road users. I do not want to be on a road where there are people coming against me and behind me who are over the limit. I want to be on a road where people are safe and observe the rules of the road, including those relating to drink-driving. The debate has to be widened out from being one limited to rural issues and pubs. The Bill is about changing people's attitudes to alcohol, which is important and necessary, especially in attitudes towards drinking and driving. We are making progress but it is important that people do not pass from 0 to 50 mg to 80 mg to 100 mg to 120 mg of alcohol in their blood. Everyone starts at 0. There is no doubt that people's driving ability is impaired the higher a person's alcohol level. The current legal level is 50 mg, which is a relatively generous level of alcohol to have in one's blood and not be found to be driving illegally. I contend that 50 mg of alcohol in one's blood does impair a person's ability to drive. However, this Bill is not speaking about levels of alcohol but about penalties. The penalty ought to be stronger. For people to lose their licence for three months is an advance and a reasonable goal. Road safety measures are not restricted to drinking and driving. Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to the many different aspects of road safety, of which speed is one. He observed that some areas of Dublin have a speed limit of 30 km/h. Many roads in rural Ireland have speed limits which are far in excess of the limit at which it is safe to drive on them. There are many roads in rural Ireland which have speed limits of 100 km/h when a person could not do anything close to that. We need to re-examine how we decide on our speed limits. Road quality is another important factor. I agree with Deputies Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Danny Healy-Rae that some of our roads are in an appalling condition and contribute to accidents. The roads in my area are in serious need of repair.That is an issue on which the Minister could concentrate. We also have the issue of roadworthiness. Again, that has improved with the obligatory testing of cars. We have also seen the obligatory wearing of seat belts. Seat belts are certainly a very important aspect of driving. I know very few people who would now not put on their seat belt before setting out and I know of many people whose lives have been saved by wearing their seat belts. We also talk about weather conditions. There are some roads in Ireland, some of our new motorways in fact, on which weather conditions seem to contribute to accidents over and above what would be expected for a motorway. There are issues in respect of the ways in which some of our motorways have been constructed. Carelessness is an issue in road safety and tiredness is a huge issue. As a politician who drives almost 300 km twice a week to come to the Dáil, tiredness is a significant factor for me, for many politicians and for other people who are tired when they drive. We know of people in this House who died because of road traffic accidents related to tiredness. We have spoken about inexperience, which is an important factor in road accidents. We have been speaking about learner drivers on provisional licences tonight. Young drivers are inexperienced and passing the test, which gives them the legitimacy of driving on their own, does not necessarily dispel their inexperience in driving. We have to recognise that point. When a person does not have a full licence, it is reasonable that he or she should drive with somebody who has experience and learn through the apprenticeship model.  Driving under the influence of alcohol, or under the influence of drugs which is increasingly an issue, is the focus of the central component of this Bill. Road safety is multifactorial. No one action brought about the fall in road deaths from 500 to fewer than 200. It was a result of many actions. We should continue to adjust all the components I have spoken about over the past few minutes to try to improve road safety. It must be remembered that a car is a lethal weapon. It can cause immense damage to the driver, the pedestrian, the passenger or the oncoming vehicle. Quite often that damage is inflicted on one's neighbours and friends because most accidents happen within a reasonable distance of the home.  This Bill comprises two important measures. It is a public health Bill on two counts. It prevents injury and death and it protects all road users. Road fatalities are not the only statistic against which we should measure road safety because every death on the road affects several hundred people. There is a ripple effect throughout the community and throughout the family. It is not just the unfortunate person who dies who is affected. Many people in families are affected. If one pays a visit to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, one will see the consequences of very serious road traffic accidents in which people have had life-changing injuries. That is very important for them, but also for their families. It has economic, social and psychosocial effects on those families. Therefore, this Bill is a public health measure for all. This is also about the responsible consumption of alcohol. We all enjoy going out to our local pub for a drink, but one can go out and enjoy a drink in one's local pub without driving home. That is the issue. If a person consumes enough alcohol to put that person over the limit, he or she should not be driving home. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae talked about the conviviality of going to the pub, the craic, the conversation and the celebrations that are carried out in pubs. That is perfectly okay and perfectly legitimate. People should engage in that kind of social interaction, but they should not then get into a car and drive home. That is the issue. One can enjoy a visit to a pub without having to get into a car under the influence of alcohol and drive home, putting oneself and every other road user one comes across at risk. Alcohol causes serious health issues. We are in the midst of a very serious crisis in respect of young people suffering very serious consequences from binge drinking, including medical consequences, particularly liver failure. There has been a change in Irish culture in the past 30 or 40 years. People who had liver failure used to be in their 60s or 70s. They were chronic abusers of alcohol. We are now seeing people in their 30s with liver failure due to the consumption of alcohol. While this Bill does not directly relate to that, it does touch on the fact that we consume too much alcohol in this society. The issue was also raised that one can be very careful at night and get a taxi home or be driven home by a friend or the publican and yet the next morning one can be stopped at a checkpoint and found to be over the limit. It does not really matter whether one is over the limit at midnight or at 8 a.m., one is still over the limit and putting oneself and other road users at risk. It is a very spurious argument which has been put forward that people are afraid to drive in the morning. They justifiably should be afraid to drive in the morning if they are over the limit. If they are driving to work while over the limit, who are they putting at risk when they turn up to work if they are operating machinery or engaging in activities? The difficulty does not end if they actually get to work successfully. They are also putting their fellow workers at risk if they are under the influence of alcohol. I do not buy the argument that this Bill will prevent people from going to the pub at night because they are afraid they will have to go to work in the morning under the influence. That should not be the case. It is like the smoking ban. The smoking ban was to be the end of the pub. Pubs would not survive if there was no smoking in them. Pubs are now far more enjoyable places to go to because one does not come out of them smelling as if one had just come out of an ashtray. The proposals in this Bill will not destroy the pub trade. I do not believe that.  I will refer to the issue of social isolation in rural areas, and perhaps also to social isolation in urban areas because one can be living in the middle of a housing estate in Dublin and not know one's neighbours on either side. The pub is certainly not the answer to rural isolation. I contend that the majority of people in rural Ireland do not go to the pub. Only a small minority of people in Ireland go to the pub. Not going to the pub is not going to increase social isolation in any way. Of course one can go to the pub and enjoy a few drinks provided one has a neighbour, friend or relative to bring one home.  Not everybody in rural Ireland drinks alcohol. In my village, the biggest card night of the week is held in our local community centre. It starts at 8 p.m. and finishes at 10.30 p.m. Everybody has a cup of tea and a sandwich. Some 70 people come and play cards. They enjoy themselves and they are home by 11 p.m. The card nights held in pubs start at 9 p.m., 9.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. and finish at 2 a.m. People tell me that they much prefer the card nights that are not related to alcohol. Of course one can go and play cards in a pub until the cows come home but one cannot then expect to drive home safely.  The issue of social isolation does not revolve around pubs. Many social activities do unfortunately revolve around pubs. Many sporting events are celebrated in a pub. If an under 13, under 14 or under 16 team win a local championship, the medals are presented in the pub. That is a very bad message to be sending to young people. It says that this is where celebrations take place. There are many aspects to rural Ireland which do not have to revolve around pubs. Rural society is much more resilient and does not have to depend on the pub culture to survive.Rural Ireland has many issues and they have been referred to tonight. Trying to hold on to our young people in rural Ireland is a huge challenge. I went to the Youth Work Ireland open day in the Mansion House this afternoon and met young people from my own county, County Clare. They did not mention anything about going to pubs or drinking and driving. Their main issues were mental well-being, getting a part-time job, the bullying and cyberbullying to which they are subjected in school and outside school, their sexuality and rural transport. Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to the rural transport system that operates in County Clare. It still operates. Anyone coming to County Clare on holidays can get Clarebus from many locations in Clare. It is a wonderful service that is growing and expanding. Public transport was a big issue for young people today at the Youth Work Ireland open day. For example, how do they get from Ennistymon, Kilrush or Scarriff into Ennis or further afield? Their options can be limited. However, none of them brought up the issue of drinking and driving or being put off the roads. Ennistymon once had the reputation of having the highest number of pubs per population in Ireland. It had 49 pubs in its heyday, or a pub for every nine men, women and children. That has changed now. I am not sure how many pubs there are in Ennistimon but it is significantly fewer than that. What has happened in Ennistymon is that the café culture that was disparaged earlier has grown and there are more places to get a cup of coffee and a sandwich there than to get a drink. All these businesses have opened up and it has changed the atmosphere and the culture in towns such as Ennistymon. One can go out and enjoy a drink, go out and enjoy oneself without a drink or go out and have one or two drinks. One does not have to exceed the legal limit to enjoy oneself, and many young people now have a different attitude to drinking and driving. This measure, I believe, is not directed at pubs or the licensed trade. Many people drink at home now; not everyone goes to the pub. One could be drinking at home or in a friend's house or go out to dinner and be over the legal limit driving home. It is not just that the alcohol is consumed in a pub; it may be consumed in a friend's house or at a function. However, it must be realised that anyone doing so must have someone to bring him or her home. One cannot drink and drive coming from those events. There is a popular myth that people can drive a little better when they have had a few pints, that they are more relaxed and their reactions are better. However, there is a direct correlation between the amount of alcohol one has in one's blood and one's reaction time. Whether one is driving on an urban or a rural road makes no difference: one's reaction times will be reduced. This is backed up by scientific evidence. I therefore speak in support of the Bill. I am from rural Ireland. I just look at this problem from a different perspective, a different angle. From my personal experience, I have seen the devastation that deaths on the road bring to a family, particularly when alcohol is involved. Many young people have been damaged and seriously injured by drinking and driving on our roads, not only urban, but also rural, so I support the Bill.

#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	458	That is grand. Again, it is very unfortunate that provisions concerning provisional drivers have been added to the Bill and to think that we will criminalise fathers and mothers - jail them, we are told. People commit serious crimes against old people in rural places and get away with it. They are not even jailed. The Minister said mothers and fathers must drive their children or teenagers with provisional licences to school, to their apprenticeships and to work. If they have two, three or four children, which they may have, are they to spend years driving these youngsters around when they could easily drive themselves? I had a proposal, which the House knows about, that young fellas or girls with provisional licences should have speed limiters fitted to their cars because we know that speed is one of the main reasons for accidents and fatalities. There are modern means of assessing the speed a driver does and it can be monitored and read. If they went over such a speed, we could do all these things to prevent speeding and make them drive more slowly and more safely. However, the Minister wants to go the hard route: jail the fathers and mothers or whoever else owns the cars. This is totally unsatisfactory to rural Ireland, where I come from. Deputy Ryan has left the Chamber, and I do not like talking about people behind their backs, but I did not send him away. I listened to him so I am disappointed he is not listening to me. I can tell him one thing: if the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he joined together, it would be a fairly serious outfit for rural Ireland. One of them on his own is bad enough, but the two of them together would be a serious concoction. I heard Deputy Ryan say he was disappointed to see so many teenagers being driven to school and that more should cycle. If Deputy Ryan were at Kelly's Cross, six miles west of Sneem, where the school bus picks the schoolchildren up, and if we did not have that school bus, and if he is saying they should cycle into Kenmare, it would be dinner time before they landed. They would only be able to stay an hour or two before they would have to think about cycling home again. How ridiculous can he be? The honest truth of it is that I raised the issue of the turns from Blackwater Bridge to Tahilla this morning on Leaders' Questions. That road cannot be cycled safely. One would be killed there because two of anything cannot pass the road. A bicycle would be squeezed. The road cannot be walked safely. Many of our roads are not fit for that, and I am sorry about that. I do not know what Deputy Ryan was aiming at when he stated how many Deputies there are in Kerry and said that so many more people were killed. I do not know what he actually meant by that. It was ridiculous talk. I get on well with Deputy Ryan personally, but what he was talking about is nonsense. He said students would be safer cycling on our roads and that they would not be killed.That is what I understood from him. That is absolutely bunkum. Deputy Harty spoke about Dún Laoghaire and people whose lives are ruined when they finish up in Dún Laoghaire in a serious condition. He made it sound like everyone who ended up in Dún Laoghaire had an accident caused by drink. I know of one poor young fellow who was cycling when it happened to him and he was not cycling on the road. He is outside there now and drink had nothing to do with it. People are trying to cloud the issue and blackguard the people in rural Ireland. That is what they are at. They are trying to isolate them. Like I said last night, they want them to feel like rabbits inside a burrow who are afraid to stick their noses out because something would take a swipe at them. I cannot see the sense in making those points. Deputy Ryan made it sound like the 159 people killed last year on the roads in Ireland were all killed because of drink. That is absolutely rubbish. Someone should be brought to account or provide statistics to tell all of the honest people around the country how those people were killed and why they were killed. Many of them were killed cycling and I am sorry about that; many of them were killed walking and I am sorry about that; many of them were killed driving and I am sorry about that too, for all of the families they leave behind who are hurt, but not all of them were killed because someone had a pint or a pint and a half. I never condone drink driving and I never will. I know what I did any time I saw someone attempting it, but it was rarely I had to do it. I still say that anyone who drinks a pint and a half or who consumes up to 80 mg never caused a fatality and they are safe to drive, and I will stand over this until the day I die. I cannot understand what gripe the Minister has with the people in rural Ireland. I would prefer if the Minister listened to me, but perhaps he is too busy and he does not care. Perhaps this is the other reason. He is certainly not interested in saving lives because if he were he would attempt to do something about the trees that are crossing our roads. A few months ago, in Storm Ophelia, three people lost their lives because of trees on our roads. It does not have to be a tree that falls on a car, it can be just a branch that will fall when the wind is blowing and come in the windscreen of a poor woman bringing children home and perhaps kill the children in the car also. The entire family and extended family would be upset and ruined forever. The Minister is making no attempt to deal with this. Take the road from Mallow to Kildorrery. Branches from trees along that road fell in the storm and they are still there, half hanging out over the road. No order or cognisance is taken of these situations and no audit has been done. The Minister could do it because he is the Minister with responsibility for transport and safety on the roads, but he just does not want to make an attempt to do so. He wants to make a name for himself this way, and this is what he is at. Look at all of the junctions. I highlighted this before but I make no apology for highlighting it again. Look at all of the dangerous junctions around Killarney.

Speed is one of the major causes of fatalities. So is tiredness when driving long distances, as people have to do now. They have to get up early in the morning and drive from places such as Cahersiveen in Kerry to Cork or Limerick and drive back home again. It makes a long day out of it and people are tired driving. There is little public transport to help or assist people travelling these distances. Mobile phones have caused many accidents. I have spoken about the ponding of water on our roads. There is a drainage programme but, as I understand it, it is a programme for draining the sides of county roads. It does not deal with the ponding of water on our regional roads or even on our national secondary roads. The inlets are closed. The section men knew where these inlets were but, sadly, we do not have the section men and no one knows where these inlets are now, so when it rains we have lakes of water on our roads-----

What will help the people who will be isolated in rural areas because they cannot go to have the one bit of comfort they have, to meet their friends and neighbours in a pub? I heard other Deputies say there were several places for people to go in rural areas, but in most of the county I know the rural villages have only a pub and there are no other facilities for people in rural areas. At one stage, Deputy Heydon suggested 33 or 35 buses would be put in place to take people home. Surely he is not serious that they would cover all of the 26 counties or, if we leave out Dublin, 25 counties. We could also leave out Cork city. Those buses would not cover the rural parts of Cork or Kerry on their own. No realisation is given to what will happen people in rural Ireland. They are lonely as it is but they will be made lonelier, especially farmers and gentlemen living on their own who have little to look forward to after their hard day's work or hard week's work. Before this, they were able to come in to their local pub and have a pint or two and they would have the slip they got at the mart and they would talk about how much they were paid for the calves and the weight of the calves, and they were able to discuss-----

How are they going to get to colleges, schools, work and other places? The Minister is not being real. They do not have the other modes of transport we have in urban areas. That is truthful and I mean it from my heart. They just do not care.

It is imperative that I point out that this is a very serious matter. I take very seriously the views of people on the other side of this House and I respect them. I respect the claim of many of them to speak for rural Ireland and to hold sincerely held views which are not held by the majority of this House, but I ask for the same respect for the views of people on this side of the House who disagree about many other things. The tone of this debate has deteriorated to a level that is utterly disrespectful to the argument, and the argument is very simple. Those on this side of the argument have one interest in this and one interest alone, namely, that the lives of people should be saved. They believe sincerely that scientific evidence, which they can point to, backs them up. People on the other side believe they are representing the voices of those who will certainly suffer psychologically, and some who will suffer materially, as a result of the measures that come in. Those particular difficulties, however, bear no comparison with the death of innocent people in crashes on the road.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	522	Even to say that an inconvenience to people, who are breaking the law, by the way, is in some way of equal importance to the deaths they cause is quite farcical and holds no water. There may be arguments about levels. There may be justifiable arguments, and there are, about rural Ireland. I think Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that the problem was there beforehand, and it was. I acknowledge fully the problems of rural Ireland, the problem of loneliness and the difficulties people face. I acknowledge that this may cause problems to one or two people, but this is not an attack on rural Ireland. Those who say it is are not just being dishonest, they are being deliberately dishonest. Rural Ireland has problems and we have a duty to address them. Maybe the Deputy is right. Maybe we are not addressing them adequately, but those problems exist independently of what we are doing here today. They would be there one way or the other.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	524	I agree that we must recognise and tackle them. That is our duty as a Government, but that does not mean that we should allow people to drive up and down the roads of Dublin or rural Ireland when they have had too much to drink. To say, as so many speakers have said, that this is not rural-proofed is, again, dishonest. If we are talking about it numerically, several speakers have quite rightly said that this measure will benefit rural Ireland more than Dublin and urban Ireland. There are more tragedies on the roads of rural Ireland than there are in Dublin. I do not want to talk in terms of statistics but the fact is that there are more people in rural Ireland burying their dead because of what is happening on the roads due to alcohol than there are in urban Ireland. That is statistically true and it was eloquently expressed by Deputy Eamon Ryan. The statistics, measures and opinion polls that have been taken scientifically by the RSA through Behaviour and Attitudes prove quite conclusively that the majority of people support this measure. It is not just a majority; it is an overwhelming majority. I do not remember the exact figure but it is somewhere between 88% and 90%. Those are well-published and well-publicised facts. I understand the emotional feelings that come from Deputies like Deputy Mattie McGrath. I recognise the utterly reasonable arguments that have been made by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae on both occasions.He is opposed to the Bill, but for reasons which I think are genuine. However, the idea that this Bill should be some sort of plaything for politicians to filibuster is not just an insult to democracy but an insult to people whose lives will be saved by it. This evening's debate has been deliberately repetitive. It has been in defiance of the wishes of the vast majority of the House. If it is allowed to continue in this vein, people will suffer and measures that could be taken will not be taken.

He is suggesting that people who failed the test umpteen times are apparently being victimised. They failed the test for very good reasons. They failed the test because they are not safe on the roads on their own. The Deputy is suggesting to me that somehow if they fail the test even more times, they should be allowed back on the road unaccompanied. He said it was unfair. It is more than fair. Those people who fail the test more frequently are more likely to offend on the road and are more likely to do dangerous things. If the Deputy wants to come in here and plead for those who failed the test to be allowed to drive unaccompanied, it is fine, but that is not something I am prepared to accept.

I have appointed two members, at least, to the board of the RSA. I appointed two members who are victims of road tragedies. I have appointed two members who will speak with authority on this issue because they have suffered on this issue. They have suffered and lost loved ones. They are influential. Are you opposing that?
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	577	Through the Chair.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	578	Is Deputy Mattie McGrath opposing that? They are there to represent the voices of those who have suffered. I believe that will bring more success to our drive for the reduction of road deaths. I believe Deputy Eamon Ryan pointed out that 159 people died on the roads last year. A large number of those were alcohol-related deaths. It is absolutely unacceptable that 159 people died, but it is indisputable that it was the lowest figure on record. That cannot be unrelated to the fact that there have been some very effective awareness campaigns and legislation, I hope, which has been aimed at reducing the number of deaths. We will continue in that vein and we will continue to introduce legislation aimed solely at saving lives. That is all. It is disingenuous for those who are on the other side to introduce issues such as mobile telephones, speed, etc. They are right that they cause road deaths. We will also tackle them, but it is no good to say, "Why aren't you tackling that?". We are starting with this and we will continue with those measures afterwards. To say that we should not address one because there is another one out there is absurd. The Deputy is right that we are not adequate in our attack on road deaths, but we will continue to do it until we reduce those figures even further. That is the important thing about the Bill. It is simply there as a start to reduce the number of road deaths. I thank Deputies Catherine Murphy and Troy. Deputy Murphy has one or two reservations about the Bill. I accept that, and I accept that about everybody because I think they are sincere in almost all cases. She has recognised that the inquest asked, particularly on the Clancy amendment, that this measure should be introduced. That was an independent opinion if ever there was one. I also recognise the presence in the Gallery today of Leo Lieghio, who suffered a terrible tragedy in his family, of Susan Gray from PARC, who has represented the bereaved and who herself is a victim, and of the Clancys, whose bravery in all cases has provided the inspiration that has led us to introduce this legislation. Those people are doing a selfless job, having themselves suffered, to try to ensure that others do not suffer in the same way. It is no coincidence that they are all supporting the Bill because they see it as a measure to ensure that others do not suffer what they had to suffer. That is a pretty selfless, self-sacrificial and honourable course to take. It would behove those who oppose it to listen to the opinions of those people, who have experienced emotions and suffering, as to whether this legislation will help or not. I also acknowledge the tremendous work Deputy Broughan has put into this issue over the years.We do not agree about everything, in fact we do not agree about very much but that does not really matter because he is a parliamentarian of great experience who has not come to these problems recently and who has pursued this for well over a decade. I apologise if it is longer. He is supporting this Bill and we should all be grateful for that support. I am grateful.  To specifically address Deputy Troy's questions, which were fair, section 39 of the 2016 Act, not the 2006 Act, is flawed and cannot be commenced. As a result there have been no prosecutions whatsoever. I am replacing this section with an amended version.  Deputy Troy talked about the test times. I think the average test time is 15 weeks. It is too high. I absolutely acknowledge that but we are addressing it and I will give the detail when we come to the section. The Department and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, are addressing that fairly aggressively. There is a possibility, and I think Deputy Munster raised it yesterday, of a massive upsurge in the demand for tests as a result of the measures we are bringing in. We have spelled out what we are going to do about that. It may mean that there is too much demand but the measure is worth taking nevertheless and we will undoubtedly be able to bring down the demand for tests over time. I think I have already addressed Deputy Collins's issues. On what he called the "booze bus", he does tend to speak in fairly general, sweeping terms. We have had several meetings of interested parties, almost all from rural Ireland, addressing that particular topic. As a result the National Transport Authority, NTA, is researching a pilot scheme which we will run for rural Ireland when we get the NTA's recommendations. I again say to Deputy Collins that I acknowledge the problem of loneliness in rural Ireland and that the transport for those who want to enjoy their normal social life is not there. I am happy to address that. I will address that regardless of this Bill. The issue has been raised in this context but I do not accept that the connection is there. We are going to address it, whatever the fate of this Bill.  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about the Men's Sheds and men having nowhere to go. That is really an awful insult to the Men’s Sheds, as though they need drink to go-----

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-25 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	606	I move amendment No. 4:In page 3, to delete line 10 and substitute the following:“1. (1) The Road Traffic Act 2010 is amended in section 4 by the substitution of the following for subsection (5):“(5) A person who contravenes this section commits an offence and is liable on indictable conviction to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.”.(2) The Road Traffic Act 2010 is amended in section 29—”.We have been debating this legislation for the best part of six hours today and yesterday and we finally get an opportunity to speak to some of the amendments we have put forward. This legislation was first brought before the Houses by the Minister in February 2017. While I do not support the filibustering of the legislation by certain Members of the House during those six hours, it is the Minister's responsibility that it has taken 16 months to bring it to where we are today. It is his proposal and he should have been able to bring it before the House in a much more timely and efficient fashion. It is the duty of all here to ensure impaired drivers are taken off our roads. Some seem to suggest there will be a change in the blood alcohol limit due to this legislation, but there is not. The blood alcohol limit of 50 mg remains the same as when it was introduced in 2011. Despite positive amendments such as the lowering of the blood alcohol limit in 2011, the introduction of penalty points and developments in regard to the introduction of random breath testing, the fact remains that we still have fatalities on our roads. The point I made on Second Stage and Committee Stage is that, if we really want to make a difference in terms of reducing fatalities on our roads, the best way is to first tackle the section where we can get the greatest gains. Not alone is the Minister not tackling those areas, but he is refusing to take an amendment from me in regard to how we could encourage people who are far in excess of the blood alcohol limit to stay off our roads. The report that has been quoted time and again on this legislation is the RSA report, "Fatal Collisions 2008-2012: Alcohol as a Factor". The facts are that in that period there were 39 fatalities recorded for people with a blood alcohol limit of more than 251 mg; 37 fatalities at a blood alcohol limit of 201 mg to 250 mg; 25 fatalities at a blood alcohol limit between 150 mg and 200 mg; and 20 fatalities at a blood alcohol limit between 100 mg and 150 mg. There are in excess of 100 fatalities in this category and the Minister is doing nothing to address this area. I put forward an amendment on Committee Stage and although I accept it may have been flawed, the Minister could have accepted the principle of the amendment and brought forward his own amendment on Report Stage, but he did not do that. The real deterrent, if we are talking about getting impaired drivers off the roads, is to make sure we have a significant Garda presence on our roads. Despite the Minister's and the Government's commitments, the number of personnel serving in the traffic corps remains well below the number for 2010. In fact, its strength is 444 fewer than it was in 2010 and there are now a mere 667 personnel in the traffic corps.
