        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 31, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I had separate meetings in London last Thursday week with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, and Prime Minister Blair which focused on Northern Ireland. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was also  present at the meeting with the Prime Minister. Earlier that week I met the Sinn Féin and SDLP leaderships. Over recent weeks both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have been discussing how we can re-establish trust and confidence in the process and make the necessary progress to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Both Prime Minister Blair and I are fully determined to achieve progress on key outstanding issues. While a great deal of work has been ongoing since before Christmas, there is a clear necessity to quicken the pace if we are to bring about a restoration of the devolved Administration in Northern Ireland in advance of the elections on 1 May. From the various contacts I have had, I know that everyone involved in this process is fully aware of the value of the prize that we wish to secure and consolidate. This is a challenge that not only must be faced by the two Governments but requires a collective effort by everyone who supports and subscribes to the Agreement and its principles. Enormous progress has been made because of the Agreement and nobody wishes to place this at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">While I acknowledge the very substantial contribution made by the IRA ceasefires and acts of decommissioning, the political realities are that the continued operations of paramilitary organisations, both republican and loyalist, have created a crisis of confidence which must be addressed. Paramilitary organisations must complete the transition to democratic and peaceful means. Activities including intelligence gathering, targeting, training, arms procurement, punishment attacks and other criminal activities must end.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">However, reducing concerns to a single issue is not helpful and will not allow us to solve the current situation in a way which will ensure stability and trust in the future. I am therefore convinced that we must aim high and bring about an outcome which sees acts of completion on all sides. We must move beyond the stop-start incremental approach which is no longer sufficient to sustain the process. I know this will not be easy but I believe it is possible and I certainly believe it is worth the maximum engagement and effort of the two Governments and the parties over the coming weeks. To achieve the necessary breakthrough, we must all fulfil our obligations and complete the implementation of all outstanding aspects of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The commitment of both Governments to the Good Friday Agreement remains firm and resolute. Renegotiation of the Agreement is not, and cannot, be an option. Round table talks recommenced last week. These meetings are chaired on our side by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen and Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. Apart from offering a forum in which the pro-Agreement parties can meet, these round table talks and implementation group meetings are addressing a number of issues including, for example, in the areas of paramilitarism, human rights, equality, the Irish language,  policing and demilitarisation. While the Ulster Unionist Party did not attend, the talks were useful and productive. Prime Minister Blair and I will hold a series of bilateral meetings with the parties in Hillsborough on Wednesday next, 12 February. This will not be in round-table format but we will be taking the opportunity to discuss with the parties both Governments' thinking and approach in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Five years after the Agreement, the people of this island appreciate the benefits of the Agreement and have a legitimate expectation that their political leaders should now finish the job of implementing it. We have that opportunity in the next few months and, despite the inevitable electoral pressures and internal political constraints, we need to seize it by regaining the sense of hope, optimism and courage that gave us the Good Friday Agreement in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The conflict within loyalism and the activities of loyalist paramilitaries are a cause of deep concern and recent horrific murders and punishment attacks once again underline the need for strong and effective action by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I welcome the recent successes of the service in taking on loyalist paramilitaries and the approach being taken by the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is an independent body with an independent chairman and secretariat. The agenda and work programme are a matter for the forum itself and neither I nor my office has any responsibility for these issues. As such, it would be inappropriate for me to report on progress to date within the forum, or to comment on its day to day operation. However, I very much appreciate the contribution being made by the forum at this time and I thank the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, all of the members of the forum and all those who have contributed to its proceedings for their contributions to date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_41">Arising from the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister, were any conclusions arrived at or agreements reached between them as to the areas which need attention and where, in the Taoiseach's own words, the pace must be quickened in order to achieve finality in this regard? What is the Government's view with regard to the 1 May elections? Recently, I took the opportunity to bring a number of newly elected Deputies and Senators to Northern Ireland to visit enclaves on either side of the divide to gain an appreciation of the situation. My view is that the elections should still take place on 1 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I note a suggestion in an article by somebody close to David Trimble that if matters are agreed before then, those matters will need to be tested. In that context, is there any leeway for postponing the elections beyond 1 May, or has the Government given consideration to that? If, on the one hand, there is a clear response from the Unionist pro-Agreement parties as to what they  can do and have done and, on the other hand, from the republican movement as to what it has done, can do and might be prepared to do, have the Taoiseach and the Government with Mr. Blair given consideration in that context to the possibility of postponement? When I met Mr. Trimble he suggested in the course of the conversation that if an invasion of Iraq took place, backed by Britain and the US, the emphasis would obviously be deflected from the Northern Ireland situation to fields elsewhere. Perhaps the Taoiseach will comment on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_43">In reply to Deputy Kenny's first question, that goes back to the issues that were in our joint statement in mid-October, first in the Prime Minister's statement and then in a follow-up joint statement we made a day or two afterwards. That followed conclusions of meetings we had in the preceding weeks and the difficulties we ran into after the events of Stormont. Those issues, which centred around the discussions at that stage, related to a position where we would see the conclusion of paramilitary organisations and we would address the other outstanding issues, which are demilitarisation and the move to a situation of normalisation in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">There is a large agenda still to be dealt with on that issue. On the policing Bill, which was published on 5 November and is going through the House of Commons, there are a number of amendments, which by and large come from the progress that we made at the Weston Park talks and the commitments that were given at that stage, particularly to the SDLP. That legislation is moving through the legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">There are a number of other outstanding issues such as human rights and the participation in community activities in Northern Ireland. They still are the key issues – as I continually state, I do not think there is one issue – and if we are to make progress, all these issues must be dealt with together.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">My reply to Deputy Kenny's second question is simple. I hold the view that 1 May is the date of the election. It is the end of a five-year term after democratically and freely held elections. I acknowledge there have been difficulties and there has been a stop-start process in regard to the institutions, but I do not see any way we can change the date of a democratic election and I have not listened to arguments about it. Like Deputy Kenny, I have heard points of view about it but they are not ones that would help the peace process in any way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I share his view that the elections should be held on 1 May, as was originally envisaged. That means that the pace must be quickened in respect of the outstanding issues. If the Assembly is to be re-assembled in order for it to be dissolved, that must take place by 21 March so that the elections take place within the six-week period.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I understand that the Taoiseach is to meet Mr. Richard Haass, the US envoy, this evening. It appears as if Mr. Haass will be resigning his position in so far as his involvement with this country, particularly Northern Ireland, is concerned. I thank Mr. Haass for his efforts. I am sure the House shares my view that the Taoiseach should convey to him, and to the American President and the American people, our sympathy on the loss of the seven astronauts in the <i>Columbia </i>tragedy last weekend, and indeed to the people of Israel and India who also had astronauts on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Does the Taoiseach intend to raise with Mr. Haass the issue of the disruptions of activities at Shannon? Does he intend to ask Mr. Haass whether allegations that one of those involved in these activities is a member of the Continuity IRA can be confirmed?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">In that context, the White House, through Mr. Haass, has confirmed that they will continue to support all efforts to bring the Good Friday Agreement to a conclusion and full implementation. Does the Taoiseach expect that Mr. Haass, on behalf of the American Presidency, will give concrete details of what will be included in that continued support?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_54">I will be meeting Ambassador Haass later this evening. He has been very diligent. He visits regularly, about every two months, and keeps in contact at all times, sometimes weekly. He has been most helpful. I will ask Ambassador Haass to convey to President Bush our condolences on the tragic loss of the space shuttle, <i>Columbia</i>, last Saturday. I have already expressed them publicly.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The Government is extremely grateful to President Bush and his Administration for their continued support of engagement with the peace process and I am glad Ambassador Haass will continue to assist us for the foreseeable future. We have seen the press reports but Ambassador Haass, in preparing for his visit today, assured us that he will be with us for several months. I will get a more complete picture in that regard later today. He will certainly be with us through this particular engagement up to the end of March. We are pleased about that because he has been extremely helpful in meeting people here, in Northern Ireland, in the UK and the US and in keeping in touch with various groups on Capitol Hill.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I believe he can be helpful to us over the next number of weeks. He has a good grip on the situation and knows the arguments. He has dealt with issues in all parts of the world and has great experience. In my view he quickly got to grips with the various arguments and angles and has the trust of all the parties in the peace process. They communicate with him regularly in confidence, in bilateral discussions and in discussions with the United States. He can be extremely helpful in trying to put pressure on us, the British Government and on the parties in the North and he has confirmed that he will be available for whatever time we need him between now and the end of March.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_57">Is the Taoiseach aware of how difficult life is and of the tension and fear engendered in many Protestant working class communities as a result of the murderous feud among loyalist paramilitaries? Is he aware of the revulsion and disgust among the majority of ordinary people, particularly in the Protestant population, at these activities? Is it not a failure of the peace process that many years later it has not succeeded in empowering ordinary people in their communities to have a normal life and control over their communities without paramilitary thugs imposing a reign of terror on them? The Good Friday Agreement institutionalises sectarian division in its structures and therefore cannot tackle sectarianism. However, if it cannot guarantee within either of the communities a peaceful life for ordinary people, what is the future for the Agreement and those communities?</p>
          <p eId="para_58">The Taoiseach did not reply to Question No. 31, in the name of Deputy Sargent. Did the Taoiseach discuss the imminent war on Iraq with Prime Minister Blair? If so, what did he say to Mr. Blair? Did he ask Mr. Blair why he was acting as a virtual foreign minister at large for the Bush Administration in drumming up support for an imminent attack on Iraq? What did the Taoiseach say about the Government's position in the event of the United States, with or without Britain's support, launching an attack on Iraq against the wishes of a majority in the United Nations? Will the Taoiseach agree that his pointed refusal last week, and that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to rule out the withdrawal of the use of the facilities at Shannon in the event of a unilateral attack is an encouragement to Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush to launch such an attack? What did the Taoiseach say and what discussions took place with Mr. Blair on this question? Would the Taoiseach agree that his own pointed refusal last week, and that of his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to rule out the withdrawal of the use of the facilities at Shannon in the event of a unilateral attack is an encouragement to Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush to launch such an attack? I want to know specifically what the Taoiseach said and what discussions took place with Mr. Blair on this question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_59">I would hope that the Good Friday Agreement has helped over the past number of years to demonstrate to the entire community how it can build trust and confidence. There have, as Deputy Higgins stated, been many difficulties. Many loyalist communities in deprived areas are having great difficulty coming to terms with the political and social change necessary. They continually point out to me in discussions that they are looking for community political leadership that will allow them to take control of their own areas and destinies. They are very anxious to do that. We, in this part of the island, must do all we can to encourage them and give whatever practical assistance we can. I am very grateful to the many community, political and cultural organisations that are doing that with loyalist communities and assisting the process of normalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">As Deputy Higgins said, however, there are still a number of violent people in these communities who, as we all know, are engaged in very dangerous actions against each other. Some are linked to loyalist paramilitary groups, some to criminal groups and drug trafficking groups. I have always emphasised – and did so again during the recent atrocities – that this activity involves just a small percentage of the people in these communities. Loyalist communities have their own distinctive tradition. We should respect that and try to work with them. I have had meetings with David Ervine and others in the past few weeks to discuss these issues. I met a number of loyalist representatives prior to Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">We try to keep in touch about community activities in particular, about how our statutory agencies can assist them and how they can at least look at some of the ideas we have implemented that might be of help to them. Members of our statutory agencies here have helped these communities by exchanging information with them. In some of these communities, however, we must acknowledge that difficult feuds have been taking place, on and off, for the last few years and are making life extremely difficult for people. The tragic events of last weekend merely fuel these difficulties. I have been keeping in touch with representatives of the loyalist community and will continue to do so. There is a great deal of pressure in these areas at the moment, however, and a great deal of pressure on many of the individuals who have played a very helpful role in the peace process over the past number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">We can only hope that the Police Service of Northern Ireland can get on top of these activities, and I admire what Chief Constable Hugh Orde is doing to try to deal with the difficulties in these communities. The essential point is that we realise that these difficulties – some sectarian and some not – are creating enormous problems, and we must try to help the loyalist community as much we can and do nothing to make life more difficult than it already is for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Regarding Question No. 31, the meeting referred to was a lengthy one on the subject of  Northern Ireland, which I attended with Ministers and officials. As always, I spent a short period of time talking to the British Prime Minister about other issues. This was a private <i>tête-à-tête</i>, but I would have restated what I have already stated in this House – that we believe in going down the UN route in dealing with this issue. The Prime Minister is well aware of my views on that as we were members of the UN Security Council last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">Taken on the round, will the Taoiseach outline to the House his best assessment, based on the meetings he has had, of the prospects of the Executive being put back in place by mid-March? What is his assessment of the minimum required from the IRA to permit this happening? What do the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair mean when they speak of "acts of completion"? Do some of those acts of completion fall to the Irish Government to implement?</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Is the Taoiseach aware of concerns among some of the parties in Northern Ireland that the twin track approach of the two Governments seems to give primacy to two parties to the Agreement, namely, the UUP and Sinn Féin?

          <p eId="para_67">My assessment ranges from pessimism to optimism. I am convinced all the parties would like to have the Executive and institutions up and running before they enter an election campaign. All the parties accept 1 May as the election date, although some do so reluctantly. If circumstances allowed, I have no doubt some parties would try to find other ways but the Governments have stood firm, as have parties in this House and at Westminster.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The acts of completion, which derive from the October position and the difficulties we had then and last summer, state there must be an unambiguous and definitive move away from paramilitary activities. I outlined in my earlier reply the various areas that must come to completion. The word "unambiguous" was used so that we would reach a conclusion in all those areas. We were not asking for a conclusion to everything, but we were certainly asking for completion on all the important things. To make progress and gain agreement, we must have a clear, definitive and unambiguous position on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The difficulty is some parties would like to see conclusions on the aspect that is their priority and feel the other issues can wait until the autumn. The House will appreciate negotiations cannot be conducted like this. If such negotiations were to be undertaken, one party would agree to them but others would not. Throughout the process I have been at pains to say that the only way to work is towards the full completion of all aspects  of the Good Friday Agreement. On each occasion, we have incrementally advanced another set of points. The difficulty is that there are not many left, but they are important ones. If they are not all taken together, I cannot see an agreement being reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">In reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question, I believe that will be difficult because the elections are around the corner and there are political pressures, the tensions of which we are all aware, and there are difficulties and internal problems within some of the parties. Therefore, to get to that position will not be easy.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The alternative – I have argued this point and I repeat it – is not to complete these issues, not to bring them to a definitive and unambiguous end, and to go into the elections with matters, to say the least, woolly and then to try to work out how we can pick up on them on the other side of the elections, but God knows what way that approach would be presented to the electorate. That would be unfair to all the parties who have worked extremely hard for the past five years in that they would not reap the benefits of their efforts from the public. I, Prime Minister Blair and, I believe, all the parties are committed to trying to find an agreement that fulfils these issues, but that will not be easy. I would not say there is any certainty about it. In reply to the Deputy's question, that is an honest assessment of the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The Deputy's second question concerned whether there are parties who believe they are sidelined or out of the equation. I understand that feeling. What tends to happen in these cases is that the parties in difficulties, the parties which we are trying to move, are the ones which get most attention in these efforts. The other parties, some large but mainly the smaller ones, do not get the same level of attention, and I understand that. It is for that reason we have the round-table process, which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, chair and the implementation group, with which Minister Browne and Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, deal. We are trying to put all these items on the agenda so that everybody concerned can be engaged and so that there is no secret set of negotiations where everybody concerned is not at least aware of the issues. Everybody knows that talks are going on, everybody concerned can give their views and people do not feel alienated from them. I do my best to ensure that. If we were discussing these issues between the Governments and one or two parties and not allowing people to give their views, that would lead to a lack of trust and confidence. Since November, we have been trying to proceed in a more structured way. The items we discuss outside that process are the same ones discussed within it. That is a fairer way to proceed because we were accused in the past of not involving people. The process is not perfect, but it is as good as we can achieve in the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">On the Taoiseach's replies to questions on Northern Ireland, to what extent can he outline the skeleton deal that has been negotiated with the parties which could result in the restoration of the North's political institutions? If he cannot give us the detail of that, can he indicate how it will be presented and if there is a certain timeframe in mind, although I know timeframes are sometimes unhelpful? Can he indicate in more detail the current position with regard to the process?</p>
          <p eId="para_75">How has he reacted or been proactive following the announcement that the UVF has withdrawn contact from the decommissioning body? Has he stressed the equal importance of the loyalist paramilitaries engaging in the peace process to that of republican paramilitaries? How has he gone about that?</p>
          <p eId="para_76">On Question No. 31, I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach had to say. He referred to Ireland going the UN route and said that Prime Minister Blair was aware of his position. Rather than going to the Prime Minister to ask him the Taoiseach's position, will the Taoiseach be more specific in saying what he means by the UN route? Does he mean, for example, that once another UN resolution is acquired, there will be Irish support for an escalation of war in Iraq or does it mean that, if the UN resolution must comply with the UN Charter, which does not countenance regime change—</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Without going into too much detail, as I mentioned in my reply to the questions tabled and to Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, co-chair the round table process. That is how we are trying to take this forward. The round table discussions have considered key competence issues beginning with paramilitarism and also including policing and normalisation. They also included an initial discussion on the principles of devolution, policing and justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">There has been a further meeting of the implementation group of the pro-Agreement parties co-chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and his counterpart, Des Browne.  It is also planned to address issues concerning the implementation of the Agreement in the areas of community relations, reconciliation and victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Work remains to be done by both Governments and we work together in trying to engage with parties and make the necessary progress. No great science is involved. It involves talking to the parties, trying to see what issues are involved, finding their bottom line positions and squaring those with the other parties. That is what we endeavour to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">There are no secret issues and most issues have been well aired. I do not wish to go through these or the detailed positions on them, but we are working together with the British Government on them. We always take account of what all the parties say. I have had many meetings with the SDLP and one with the Ulster Unionist Party. We have had meetings with Sinn Féin and several with my colleagues in the other parties. I met any of the parties who sought meetings with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">Having gone through that process since Christmas, we hope that next Wednesday night we will be able to go through these issues again with the parties and with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and me, and reach agreement in the areas where we can see progress at least. We will keep the round table discussions and implementation going to see if we can narrow down the areas of disagreement. There are not that many but obviously we are not going to make progress in one of them. We have to deal with them all. There is also the question of the policing legislation going through the House of Commons. We are trying to make progress so that we can have devolved institutions up and running by 21 March – that is the key date – to allow the election to take place. We will continue to operate that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">We want to see the current differences between Iraq and the international community resolved peacefully through the United Nations and to avoid any recourse to unilateral action. I have not changed from that position for many months and I make that point to leaders and prime ministers whenever I have an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which we supported and worked hard to secure, has two mechanisms intended to avoid war. It first seeks to maintain the central role of the Security Council in deciding whether Iraq has met its obligations and how the international community should respond. It also provides that the council will meet again if the inspectors report non-compliance to consider what further steps are needed to bring about Iraqi compliance. That position has not happened yet. The Security Council seeks to compel Iraq to meet its obligations by giving the Iraqi authorities a final chance to comply with their obligations to divest themselves of their chemical, biological and nuclear weapon capabilities. Unfortunately, for more than a decade, the  Iraqi leadership has refused to comply with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">It is obvious to all that one way or the other the Iraqi leadership will no longer be permitted to evade disarmament obligations. Saddam Hussein could end all this tomorrow by simply ordering his regime to co-operate fully and proactively with the UN inspectors. I am sure Deputy Sargent joins me in hoping he will take that option and make it easier for his own people as well as everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In my discussions with others, including Prime Minister Blair, I stress we must continue to make every effort to find a peaceful solution, which is the objective of the Irish Government. We have constantly drawn attention to the risks involved in military action, the loss of life, the material destruction, the danger of destabilising the already volatile region, the deepening of misunderstanding between the people of Islam and the rest of the world. These are all issues, not to mention how to put it all back together again, regardless of whether there is a regime change. That does not worry me one way or another. If there is a war—</p>

Let us be mindful that towards the latter end of last year the British Prime Minister stated the British Government had not fully implemented its commitments within the Good Friday Agreement. Since the suspension of the institutions, there has been no indication as to whether a plan exists or that one will be presented in order to break the current situation, have the institutions restored and allow the Good Friday Agreement to proceed.</p>

There is almost a singular concentration on one of the parties to the Good Friday Agreement. I am pointing out the failures of others, the British Government in the first instance. I wish to ask a question on the commitments of the Taoiseach and his Government.

          <p eId="para_113">The Deputy usually gives out to me for giving the GAA too much money. On a serious note, I am well aware of the issues mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin and their importance. However, I would be in a much better position to try to resolve matters if I knew everybody's full plans, including those of his party and those of the British Government. Unfortunately, I do not and must, therefore, try to interpret and work out these matters as best I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I assure the Deputy that I do not take the narrow view that one party can resolve this on its own. Equally, he must understand that other parties have different priorities which must also be considered. That is the only way to negotiate. We must take on board the concerns of the Unionists, to which Deputy Rabbitte adverted in asking what issues would break down mistrust and create confidence. These are the existence of paramilitaries, targeting, the finding of information on people, punishment attacks, criminal activities, arms procurement, training and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">On the other side, I totally understand the concerns among communities about demilitarisation, including the fact that helicopters are landing in people's back gardens and in playing fields. These are major difficulties. The only way we will make progress is to ensure satisfactory implementation of an agreement which deals with normalisation and demilitarisation issues on one side and sees the end of paramilitary activity on the other. In addition, the human and civil rights agenda, as well as other issues Deputy Ó Caoláin has raised on many occasions in the House, on which I agree with him, must be addressed. We will do all we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I accept there are outstanding issues with which we have to deal, including legislative and other measures. We also have to deal with issues concerning policing, and a Bill will be published shortly on outstanding policing issues. We are also dealing with a number of human rights aspects. We all have commitments. They are not confined to any one party.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">There are a number of matters concerning the Irish language, some of which have to do with institutional, funding and broadcasting issues which are all important and of which we are supportive.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, in order to get an agreement that would satisfy those who are sceptical about republican activities we would have to have comprehensive progress that would show that paramilitarism and its various elements have ceased. Without that, whatever about convincing myself, I would not be able to convince the Unionist parties or even some of the Nationalist groups because they want to see an end to this. Hugh Orde, who is doing a good job from everybody's point of view, needs support and to do that we need progress on policing. The only way to deal with the situation in Northern Ireland, which continues to be difficult, is by having absolute support for proper policing which has the support of all communities in all areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I made a speech on this issue in 1998 in which I said that the Patten work was probably the most crucial aspect of the whole agreement. I have not changed my mind in that regard because I do not know how we can get on top of these issues until we have a police service that is accepted by everybody. We have to try to achieve that because if we solve other issues without solving that issue, they will feed back into it. I am sure Deputy Ó Caoláin will appreciate that we cannot resolve the issue of confidence because people will always worry about the security situation in terms of dissidents and others, so we must try to come to a conclusion on that. I appreciate the support of the House in these issues and we will do our best next week. That will not be the finality of it; we will then move into meetings for the next number of weeks.</p>

      <b>Mr. Allen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the way in which he proposes to support local authorities in order that they can deal with the serious financial shortfall that has arisen for them due to an inad equate allocation from his Department to fund ongoing services and also due to their obligations under the benchmarking proposals and the new national wage deal.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_123">I assume the allocations referred to in the question are the general purpose grant allocations made from the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I do not accept that these allocations are insufficient. It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own current expenditure levels for any year in the context of its annual budgetary process. All such expenditure, whether it be in relation to pay or otherwise, is funded from a variety of sources including specific State grants, commercial rates, fees and charges for services and general purpose grants from the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The amount of funding made available to local authorities through the general purpose grants from the local government fund has grown to record levels over the past few years. I have allocated a total of €626 million for such grants in 2003. This amount represents an increase of 6.4% over the 2002 allocation and is some 85% higher than the corresponding allocation for 1997. I am confident that this level of funding, together with increases in income from local sources, is appropriate to meet the reasonable cost of local authority services in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Since its establishment, the local government fund has also been the primary source of funding for non-national roads and major improvements of this road network have been realised under this arrangement. In 2003, non-national road grants will amount to some €434 million, which represents an increase of over 92% on 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The funding arrangements introduced through the local government fund in 1999 have therefore served local authorities reasonably well. However, with a view to further reform and improvement of the system, I intend to commission a major independent review of local government funding particularly to meet the challenges of local government into the future. I intend that this review will be broad ranging and will examine all practical options for financing local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">In the meantime, I intend that allocations from the local government fund to local authorities will take into account both the costs facing authorities and the ability of authorities to meet such costs from local sources.</p>

He is giving the power to the managers under the new legislation being brought before the Seanad next week. He has signalled that there will be a €200 water charge on each household. He has forced local authorities into a position where they are now increasing rent on old age pensioners to the tune of approximately €9, long before they have even got the €10 increase on their social welfare benefits. Will the Minister now do the decent thing and declare that rates on domestic dwellings are being reintroduced? Will he also accept that many local authorities, because of the scale of increases they received this year, their obligations under benchmarking and other liabilities, will not be able to buy a shovel by August?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_132">I do not accept what the Deputy says. I am aware from all the local authorities around the country, and I met a number of them recently, that they are very pleased with the allocations. Some months ago there was an expectation on the part of all Members of this House, or certainly on the part of the Opposition, and from commentators, that the funding available this year would be substantially below what was available last year. That has turned out not to be the case because an enormous effort was put in by myself and my colleagues to examine all the resources available to us and ensure that we maintained the record level of funding for the local government system. I did that because I understand, having served in the local authority structure, the demands on local authorities for the delivery of services throughout the local government system and I am deeply concerned about how all of this is to be maintained in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Local government gets its funding from a range of sources and I am aware that the provision of waste management, water systems, water delivery to homes, etc. is becoming very expensive, and rightly so because the public have demanded higher standards, something to which I subscribe. Members should understand that the "polluter pays" principle is a legal requirement to which we agreed under EU directives and legislation introduced by different parties over the past number of years, and which includes householders who are responsible in the context of the disposal of their own waste. What I did in the committee, which I thought was a fair approach, was to impart the knowledge to the committee on the best assessment I had been given from local authority managers which is that the real costs of disposing of household waste is around €11 per week. That is an average figure. I am not saying everybody has to pay for this but we wanted to put into the public domain the fact that people are paying substantially less than the real costs  and are being subsidised for that approach. That is not sustainable in legal terms either. There is no question of rates being reintroduced.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gilmore</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the details of the agreement reached with the trade unions and employer organisations regarding the building of 10,000 affordable houses; when the scheme will start; the way in which it will operate; the manner in which it differs from the affordable housing scheme announced in 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_141">In discussions on a new national pay agreement, the Government has agreed to work with the parties to the pay agreement to develop an appropriate new initiative aimed at further enhancing the supply of affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The details of the scheme have yet to be worked out. The parties to the pay agreement proposed this new initiative with the objective of increasing the supply of affordable housing by 10,000 units. It is envisaged that this initiative will differ from the 1999 affordable housing scheme in terms of the target group and the fact that it will be designed not to have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Furthermore, it is intended that the initiative will not detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programmes, or affect the momentum of delivery of these programmes. I welcome this initiative as another means of bringing more affordable housing on stream. In responding to the proposal, the Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing for the target groups concerned. We will work with the parties to the pay agreement to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised. It will be important more generally to ensure the continuation of measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses and ensure it remains at the forefront of all our policies.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_144">I am surprised to hear such a degree of vagueness regarding the new initiative when the talks are reaching a conclusion. First, the Minister said the target group for this initiative would be different from the existing schemes. What is the target group for the new initiative? Second, the Minister stated the new scheme would not have an impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances. Will he therefore confirm that the intention is to fund this new scheme from the national pension reserve fund, as has been reported? Third, can the Minister confirm that it is agreed by Government that this initiative will deliver 10,000 additional dwellings – that is, in addition to the existing affordable housing scheme and other schemes? Over what period of time will this be done?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_145">The difference, as I said, is that there will be no effect on Exchequer funding. At present there is a significant Exchequer input into social and affordable housing schemes in terms of resources to get them up and running. This scheme will target people who were close to being able to get mortgages but who were unable to do so due to the cost of housing. One of the principles underlying this is the cost of land, as the Deputy will know. He will know the State is looking at available resources in terms of land in State ownership throughout the country. I would not expect a huge amount of land owned by the State to become available suddenly, though there may be some resources in this area. What those are I do not know at present but let us wait and see what emerges.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I agree with the social partners, who brought this issue to the talks and who put great emphasis on affordable housing. I acknowledge that and will respond to it, but I do not wish to put it into another category. I want to ensure that over the next three years, the life of the programme, we begin to deliver more than 10,000 houses in the affordable sector. I believe we will do so and that we will be able to upscale the volumes coming through the system, not just because this issue has been discussed in the talks, but because I have changed other areas under Part V in recent legislation, as the Deputy will be aware. That should expand the delivery of affordable housing but we must look at some of the details involved. I welcome the fact that there is a concentration and focus on this but the exact details have not been worked out yet.</p>

Is there or is there not an initiative on housing? The Minister cannot tell us how many houses are involved or if it is going to happen. It will be houses out of thin air because there will be no Government money for it. There is some hint there may be State land involved, though the Minister is being cautious today in what he says about that. Will he tell the House what he knows about this scheme? There has been much press speculation and commentary. Will he tell us in simple terms who will benefit from this, how it will be paid for, who will build the houses and how many will be built?</p>

      <b>Mr. Morgan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the way in which he defines the polluter pays principle; and his views on whether such proposals must be rooted in the principle of a zero waste strategy and dealing with the wider issues such as service charges and the empowerment of local government.
      [2775/03]
    </p>
        </question>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_158">The polluter pays principle, or PPP, seeks to ensure that the costs arising from environmental damage are borne by those responsible and not imposed on society as a whole. By internalising these costs, economic actors are given an effective incentive to take negative effects into account when making cho ices about production or consumption. The application of the PPP is contained in Article 174 of the consolidated Amsterdam treaty and is a specific legal requirement under various elements of EU environmental legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">In the area of waste management, the framework directive, 75/442/EEC, makes explicit provision for implementation of the PPP, by requiring the cost of disposing of waste to be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a waste collector. The Government recognises, as fundamental to efficient waste management, that all producers of waste should pay fully for its collection, treatment and disposal. Accordingly, application of appropriate waste service charges is both a requirement of EU legislation and consistent with national waste management policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The provision included in the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 will allow for the making of different charges based on the quantity, volume or type of waste involved. It will therefore facilitate incentivisation of waste prevention, minimisation and re-use, considerations which are part of the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste management options, although also commonly associated with so-called "zero waste strategies". Waste service charges are, and under the Bill will remain, matters in the first instance for local authorities. The ability to raise income locally for the services provided by local authorities is an important aspect of the empowerment of local government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_161">Does the Minister agree that in reality the consumer pays and not the polluter? We need disincentives to prevent things continuing as they are and we need incentives for less emissions and for better, reusable, recyclable and reduced packaging. Does the Minister agree that we need clear thinking and not the muddled Government policy we currently have, with tax incentives for wind farms being cut? We also have the bizarre situation in Louth and Meath where consumers who visit civic amenity centres to deposit recyclable items are being charged. In other words, this is a disincentive for them to recycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">We were told during the incineration and waste management debate 18 months ago that Irish people would never recycle and now people are falling over themselves to recycle, particularly with the ever-increasing cost of refuse disposal, but local authorities in the charge of the Minister are responsible for disincentives to recycle. Can the Minister take the initiative and fund local authorities adequately while stopping the madness of presenting people with disincentives to recycle?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_163">I do not accept the generalisations the Deputy makes when talking about all local authorities. As we know, some local authorities have been very proactive in this area and lead the way. They are far ahead of some other auth orities. That is of great credit to local authority members and the executive that works with them. In each local authority area, people know their responsibilities and I am trying to encourage them to get on with this. Since I came into office, I have announced €15 million in funding which I have made available to local authorities for recycling facilities. This has significantly increased the numbers available. I accept and have publicly acknowledged that we need a lot more in terms of recycling.</p>

I am aiming most of the public resources available to me at the area of recycling. That is a crucial element and will deliver about 50% of what is being produced in waste back into the recycling area, thereby substantially reducing the funding needed for other aspects such as landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The strategy for waste management, and its four elements, have at last been put in place. Unfortunately, local authorities have for the last ten years sat on their hands and would not take the necessary decisions. There is no point talking to me on behalf of local authorities.

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_179">For example, last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for over 15 years. It is estimated that total social housing output last year, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, met the needs of approximately 12,500 households compared to just over 8,500 in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">With regard to the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, the targets for completion under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for both schemes are 1,000 each per annum. Activity under both schemes has increased steadily and output last year is expected to have reached some 2,500, well ahead of the target. I am confident that this figure will be exceeded this year on the basis of the number of units currently under construction and planned new units which will commence during the year. In addition, the availability of funds at lower interest rates, following the recent reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank, will allow local authorities to reduce the mortgage payments for purchasers, thereby increasing the affordability of the schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The Government has also implemented a wide range of measures to moderate house price increases and improve affordability by boosting housing output and by removing infrastructure and planning constraints on residential developments. Over 57,000 new houses are estimated to have been built last year. This was the eighth consecutive year of record house completion and is a vindication of the policies and measures operating in support of housing supply. The Government intends to maintain strong social and affordable housing programmes this year and into the future.</p>

He has a knack of comparing figures to 1997 but, since 1997, house prices have trebled, the number on waiting lists has doubled and I do not hear anything from him that gives hope to those attempting to buy their homes or waiting for housing from local authorities. What incentives does the Minister intend to give to people hoping to own their homes? The only incentives in place at present are for investors.

          <p eId="para_185">That is where the main emphasis has been. Some 57,000 new houses last year is a high figure. If anyone suggested five or ten years ago that anything like that number could be built in one year, one would have expected that all the problems of the world could be solved. It is a high figure and that level of output will have to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I agree that house prices have gone up as have numbers on waiting lists. There has been pressure on all sides of the housing market but significant resources are being put in. This year, the main capital programme amounts to €930 million, more than double the figure for two years ago. This is an enormous amount of money and the output figures are very significant. There are more people on waiting lists but some 32% of those are single people; ten years ago, they would not have been eligible to get on a local authority waiting list so like is not being compared with like. However, of the 48,000 households on waiting lists, some 12,500 received offers last year and a similar number will get offers this year. I am not suggesting that the number on the list will reduce by 12,500 as others are coming on all the time, but significant resources are going in and, if that can be kept going, significant improvements are expected.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">Like Deputy Gilmore, I am surprised that the Minister is not aware of the detail of the deal done by the social partners. I find it strange that, as the policy creator, the Minister does not have a more hands on input into what is happening. We hear of announcements but the real crux of the problem is supply and demand, and the attractiveness of the market to the investor. What does the Minister propose to do with regard to the availability of land for house construction? My local authority is an example in that it cannot provide land for housing because it does not have a landbank. What is the Minister doing to ensure that neighbouring local authorities have a co-ordinated approach to the provision of private and public housing?</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_188">Something similar happens in the local authority that I and Deputy Cuffe were  members of because Dublin City Council does not have a lot of land. However, the four or five local authorities in the area work in a co-ordinated way. They may not all have landbanks but something like €430 million has been spent by local authorities in recent years acquiring sites, so some people out there have sites and local authorities are making good use of them by building on them and by entering PPP arrangements with private developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">This is fundamentally about supply. The Deputy may feel that investors moved in last year following the budget of 2001, but that was because of the price of rental accommodation at that time. There was a crazy situation where it was dearer to rent than to get a mortgage. That brought investors back in and rents have stabilised, and dropped in some cases. That move was successful and we must continue to increase supply. This is not just about investors; the number of first-time buyers in the market is still holding up well if not increasing.</p>

While my Department has had no involvement in the selection of the study team or in its subsequent deliberations, I understand that the team has submitted a draft study report to the HRB, which then submitted it to an external academic peer review process, as is normal practice in such cases.

          <p eId="para_192">I thank the Minister for his reply. This health report was expected this time last year. Many county councillors were forced to vote on the waste management plan without knowing if people's health was at risk. Does the Minister agree that if toxic substances are released into the air, they may get into the food chain? If the incinerator is built in an agricultural or tourist area, it could affect people and devastate a local economy. Does the Minister agree that, apart from Ringsend, most of the proposed incinerators are located in rural communities, yet most waste is generated in urban areas? It is almost as if the Department is subconsciously  aware that something terrible could go wrong with incinerators.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">It is interesting that the Minister is responsible for local government, yet he is taking power away from county councillors to decide their own waste management plans. He plans to have legislation before the Dáil in three to four months' time to take power away from councillors to impose bin charges. There is no enthusiasm to encourage recycling. We have not heard much about where the toxic ash from the incinerators will go. Will the Minister support building an incinerator in Waterford city or will he play politics and build it outside the city, perhaps in County Wexford?</p>

          <p eId="para_198">The Deputy made interesting points. It is interesting to talk to my colleagues in Europe where a number of thermal treatment plants or incinerators are being built. However, there is not a word about these developments. I have asked if there are problems with local communities and I have been told that there are no problems. I have also been told that they are being built in urban areas. The reason is they fully understand and appreciate that thermal treatment plants are of such a high standard, given the standards we have set in the EU, that they almost remove all the dioxins from the atmosphere. A number of Deputies seem to suggest that we should continue to allow the constant release of large amounts of dioxins through illegal burning and dumping rather than managing our facilities properly and putting in state-of-the-art modern facilities throughout the country. I think I am the only Deputy in the House who has lived beside an incinerator for the past 11 years and I am happy that my health is as good today as it was 11 years ago.</p>

They are taking out some of the old plants and building modern ones. Our standards are high. Ireland is lucky in that we come to this part of our solution later than other countries. The advantage is that because standards in technology have improved in the past three or four years, the standards in our plants will be high. Less than 2% of dioxins in the air in this country will come from those plants when they are operational, as proposed in the waste management strategy.</p>

However, it is not all right. If the Deputy was seriously concerned about the environment and people's health, he would want to stop the huge mismanagement of our waste and move to state-of-the-art, controlled and managed facilities which we know will substantially reduce the danger to human health. That is what I am trying to do. I hope the eminent and highly qualified doctor agrees with that. We cannot sustain the wanton misuse of our environment which is causing considerable damage.

      the increase in the cost of a new house and a second-hand house for 2002; the expected increase for 2003; his plans for measures to make housing more affordable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [2368/03]

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_209">My Department's most recent house price data extends to the first nine months of 2002 and indicates house price inflation of 3.1% and 6.6% for new houses in Dublin and nationwide, respectively, and 8% and 7.9% for second-hand houses in Dublin and nationwide, when compared to the same period in 2001. Further information on average house prices is provided in my Department's Quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. While my Department does not publish house price forecasts, projections from a number of market sources envisage a low rate of house price increases for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The substantial increases in housing supply in recent years are of critical importance in improving affordability and moderating house price increases. The year 2002 was the eighth consecutive year of record output levels, with an estimated 57,000 houses completed and an anticipated 30% increase in housing output in the Dublin area. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of about 40% per annum in 1998 to more moderate levels currently. By continuing to support increased housing supply, the Government will maintain its efforts to ensure moderating price increases into the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_211">Does the Minister agree with the assessments of a number of estate agents and building societies, which published data in the early part of this year, that there was a substantial increase in house prices in the last quarter of 2002 and that the year on year increase in house prices – 2002 as against 2001 – is approximately 12% for the average house? If supply is increasing, as the Minister of State keeps reminding us is the answer, why are house prices also increasing? Does the Minister accept that decisions made by the Government, including budgetary decisions which have increased the level of investor activity in the housing market, are leading to the continued rise in house prices and to the situation where 50% of young couples in urban areas cannot afford to buy a home of their own? Is it time for the Government to change its housing policy?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I disagree with the Deputy. There is a sense of fairness to the thrust of his questions and there is a level of frustration. However, over the past ten years when our problems began, the level of housing output was exceptionally low. I  suppose we were coming out of a bad economic frame in the 1980s. We got exceptional growth through the 1990s and all Governments have tried to respond to that. In addition there was huge growth in employment, a huge decrease in unemployment and a young population. I do not offer them as excuses but as the reality we are trying to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">It was clear by the end of the 1990s – my colleague, the Minister of State is right – that the supply was way behind the demand. When that happens, prices are driven forward. It is clear from the figures that house price inflation, 40% in 1998 and into 1999, dropped substantially. There is a number of reports, to which the Deputy referred, on what happened at the end of last year. I understand those figures will be available at the end of March and they will probably indicate some pressure emerging. However, it is clear that we must continue to ensure supply. I am endeavouring to deal with that in conjunction with the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">We need to achieve a huge increase in the social and affordable housing bracket. I believe that will begin to emerge during this year and over the next few years through the mechanisms under Part V, the 20% provision and other mechanisms. As I said previously in the House, we should look at the mortgage timeframe as a whole life mortgage. There are successful examples on the Continent in that regard. I have had preliminary discussions with people in the general financial institutions as to how this might work and I believe it is feasible in conjunction with the Housing Finance Agency and the National Development Finance Agency. We have increased supply to a very high level which is probably well ahead of anything taking place elsewhere in the world, certainly in Europe. We must continue to drive that situation forward, increase the mix and continue to achieve supply. The present average number, at 57,000, is at the level we need to maintain over the next ten years. We need to improve the affordability mix within that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_215">In a country with such a low density of population and such huge tracts of undeveloped land, is it not a signal of failure that financial institutions are enticing parents back into the mortgage trap to bail out their children who cannot afford a house in Ireland in 2003? Does the Minister admit that is a signal of failure of Government housing policy over several years?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I presume whole life mortgages were not in the Minister's election manifesto nine months ago. Arising from Deputy Gilmore's question and given the inordinate price increases, particularly within the greater Dublin area, will the Minister consider taking steps to break up the cartel of land owners who effectively control the price of building land in that area and are significant contributors to Fianna Fáil coffers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_217">This is a difficult subject to deal with in the context of Question Time. I put it to the Minister that while supply has increased and that is welcome, a new demand for housing has been generated from investors. Depending on which set of figures one takes – that of the local authorities' housing strategies which indicates that 40% to 50% of newly formed households are being priced out of the market or that used in advertisements by at least one building society which puts it as high as 70% – is there not a real problem which the increased supply has not addressed, namely, affordability? Has the Minister plans, either through this House or otherwise, to put on record a revision of Government policy to address the issue of affordability? It is poor comfort to anybody who cannot afford to buy a house that more houses are being built.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_218">Any financial institution can think up its own marketing tools and strategies to attract people into the market. There are different views on the marketing initiative to which the Deputy referred and it is not for me to comment on that. The present housing situation is certainly not an indication of failure. Various policies and initiatives have been developed over many years by the private sector. In relation to Deputy Allen's reference to land cartels, anything of that nature operating in the marketplace would be a serious worry. I believe we have reached a position on two matters. First, we have capacity in the marketplace which is delivering at a level we need to equal demand. Second, incomes have also reached capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The huge changes in the tax regime in the last few years have resulted in very substantial increases in net incomes. Overall gross incomes have also risen very substantially. That trend will no longer apply, certainly for the next few years. Irrespective of investors, cartels, developers or whatever, we have reached those positions. Any product can only be sustained on the basis that the market can afford it. I believe the market is at its absolute maximum and that is where I want to keep supply. I cannot see how prices will continue to rise beyond that.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I wish to refer to one further point and I agree with Deputy Gilmore on the limitations of Question Time in this regard. In relation to investor demand, there are choices we have to make as a society. We can choose to allow people who have money to look at the range of options available, be that to invest in Barclays Bank shares or wherever they wish to invest in the UK. That is a bad use of resources for this country. Instead of focusing on stocks and shares in this State, we took the view that we needed product, especially in terms of additional property, even in the rented sector. Affordability is the key issue and, in my view, the control of affordability lies in equating supply to demand.</p>

A particular objective of the directive is to ensure that all ELVs are collected, dismantled and recovered by industry in an environmentally sound manner at no cost to the final holder. The directive further requires that a system for the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of scrapped vehicles be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">These stakeholder bodies submitted an agreed initial proposal for an ELV management scheme to my Department just over a year ago. This replaced earlier proposals by SIMI alone. Consultants were since engaged by the stakeholders to assist in the development of the agreed initial proposals and agreement in principle has been reached on the operation of an appropriate ELV recovery scheme that will fulfil the main requirements of the directive. Discussions with the stakeholders in relation to operational details relating to the introduction of the proposed ELV recovery scheme are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am preparing appropriate legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly to support implementation of the detailed ELV recovery scheme consistent with the requirements of the directive. The implementation of the directive in Ireland, which provides for the free take-back of ELVs by the final holder to authorised treatment facilities, should result in a decrease in the number of ELVs being abandoned, thereby reducing their availability for anti-social purposes.</p>

There is an epidemic of joy-riding in urban areas where these vehicles are made available. My colleague, Councillor Michael O'Connell of Cork, was on the public airwaves about this during the week. On two occasions my colleague, Deputy  Broughan, introduced a Bill to deal with this problem which was voted down by the Government.

          <p eId="para_228">I am delighted the question has been asked and I will be direct with the Deputy. We have reached agreement, a fact I welcome given that I put a great deal of time into ensuring a positive outcome. I agree we needed it urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">At present, the industry is simply dealing with some operational technicalities. I want the legislation and all the enabling provisions in primary legislation in place by the autumn of this year. I want the fund to commence so that the whole operation starts in the spring of next year. That is a very short timeframe. I accept the Deputy would like us to set an earlier date but, in fairness to the representative motor organisations and everybody else concerned, we now have agreement. This matter is being comprehensively addressed. I want the end-of-life vehicles to be taken back free from the consumers. The scheme will be in place in the timeframe stipulated under the EU directive. We will meet all our requirements and I am happy to put that on the record of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">This problem has scarred the faces of many suburbs of cities and towns and has caused a number of deaths. I am amazed to hear the Minister state it will be next spring before he will have the system in place to deal with this. Perhaps I am naive, but surely the last registered owner of a very old vehicle can be traced and held responsible for its safe disposal. Surely that is the nucleus of the problem. Why can the last registered owner not be traced through the engine serial number and held responsible? If this does not happen, there will be more deaths and more areas will be scarred by this mainly urban problem.</p>

I am being realistic in saying there will be sufficient funding available to start the full procedure for the free take-back of vehicles in the spring of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I have been fairly explicit in response to Deputy Gilmore, and I will be so again with Deputy Allen, when I say that all of the necessary enabling and primary legislation will be in place by autumn of this year. We have agreed everything with all of the parties and they are simply working on some of the operational technical  aspects. That is as quickly as I could have acted since I took office. I put time into getting it done because both I and the Government agree that the anti-social way these vehicles are being used is unacceptable. That apart, their environmental impact on urban areas and many rural areas throughout the country is appalling.</p>

Second, now that there is a deadline, which I welcome, has the Minister considered the possibility that some unscrupulous elements in the motor trade may use the interval between now and the publicly announced deadline to shed old vehicles so that between now and then we may unwittingly see an increase rather than a decrease in the problem?</p>

          <p eId="para_234">The Minister may be aware that when the Department of Agriculture and Food was drawing up the de-stocking levels, one of the issues which impacted on the amount of stock to be permitted on commonages was whether there were abandoned vehicles in the area. If there were abandoned cars, as happened in Wicklow and Mayo, the stocking levels were reduced. Would the Minister agree to forward his proposals to the Minister for Agriculture and Food so that he could take this into consideration when appeals come before the newly established appeals board?</p>

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_235">I welcome Deputy Gilmore's response to the fact that I have gone on record once again and have outlined definitive deadlines. However, I do not accept his point that this will result in a surge because there is a great deal of work being done by the Irish motor industry. I compliment the SIMI on this work. The stakeholders will be responsible for the operation of this scheme and obviously the primary stakeholder in this will be the SIMI. Based on the agreement, I am confident it will be a good scheme and that the take-back of vehicles will be free which will be an enormous incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I will look at legislation to put certain responsibilities on the vehicle owners to freely give over the vehicle. It will not cost money but I want to make sure that, where they own a vehicle which is clearly at the end of its life, they take their environmental responsibilities into account as well. From what the Deputy has said regarding a deadline, which he supports, it seems I am damned if I do and damned if I do not. I want to see this implemented and believe we will achieve a good result here.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_242">The House will be aware that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was enacted for good reasons. I raise this matter today because I am concerned at reports that the Government wants to amend this legislation in a way that would amount to a denial of the right of access, the right of transparency and the right of accountability to the people in respect of Government papers after 1998, which would coincide with the period of office of the Taoiseach's first term as Taoiseach. It is fair to say that the Act  has been a major success and has added to the transparency and accountability, both of Departments and of Government. Today's reports suggest that the Government intends to amend this in a way that will make it not as accountable as it should be in the people's interest, given that the Act was passed by the entire House. I would ask the Taoiseach whether it is his intention to proceed in this manner and if he will confirm the truth or otherwise of the reports contained in today's newspapers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_128">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_243">Arising from the recommendations of the high level group on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, the Government has instructed the Minister for Finance to prepare amending legislation to give effect to the group's recommendations and to provide for related matters which have arisen since the enactment of the original legislation. There is also the report of the commissioner who has had the job for the past five years of overseeing cases of dispute and other aspects which the commissioner believes would assist the legislation. The Department of Finance is preparing that draft legislation, which the Minister will bring to Government for approval in due course. Until the Government has approved the heads of a draft Bill, I cannot comment on any provisions which may or may not be included. There is speculation but at this stage it remains speculation.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The high level commission was not made up of Ministers but of officials who had the job of operating the Act for the past five years. The legislation will come before the House in due course, when everybody will have an opportunity to debate it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_245">We will oppose any proposal to amend the Act in a way that would restrict the right of the public to such information. While the Act may have been written by civil servants, it is up to the Government to implement it. It is not a matter for the Department of Finance. It appears from newspaper reports that applicants for information under the Act are treated differently, according to whether they are members of the media or the public. The Act specifically provides that the head of the information section in a Department must disregard the source of the application for information. In other words, there must be no discrimination in how it is treated. It is a breach of the law by Departments if they are restrictive in the way they provide information.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Will the Taoiseach confirm that there will be no change in the five year rule which, under the Act, came into force in April 1998? The section the Taoiseach referred to in respect of the commissioner has not yet come into force. If this does not happen and the Government proceeds to amend the Act, the public will see it as nothing short of a cover up.</p>

It was always intended that  there would be a review of the Freedom of Information Act after five years, when there would be an opportunity to examine its implementation. The suggestions from the information commissioner and some of the people who have worked on this will improve the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">With regard to changing the 30 year rule to five years, we will have to wait and see what is proposed. My view on the matter is clear and on the record. I believe changing the rule from 30 years to five years is too much.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">With regard to the process, the issue of who makes the freedom of information request is not taken into account. An independent official in each Department deals with the applications and the matter does not go near the political system. I do not believe a request should be treated differently because of where it originates.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_252">Two days before the last Government left office, an indemnity was signed by the State, the all-embracing nature of which had not previously been seen. In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday a story was run under the headline: “PDs say taxpayers will face €2bn abuse bill”. This is the response of a party in the Government. The State settled, nominally, for €128 million from the religious congregations but the minor party in Government says the cost will be €2 billion. I refer the Taoiseach to the clause quoted in the report from a memorandum to the finance committee. It states:</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The initial negotiations with the religious institutions were conducted by a group consisting of officials from the Departments of Education and Science (Chair), Finance and the Office of the Attorney General; however, the final negotiations and agreement in principle were concluded by the then Minister for Education and Science, Michael Woods.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Why does that communication to the finance committee seem to draw a distinction between the process of negotiations that involved the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's office and the deed that was negotiated by a Minister who was due to lose office in two days? Why did it happen in that fashion?</p>
          <p eId="para_255">If the Taoiseach says he will not publish the advice of the Attorney General, will he tell the House that the Attorney General was involved? Why would the Progressive Democrats claim that it will cost €2 billion, since they are partly responsible? Are they saying that the Attorney General, while shimmying up lampposts, could not apply  his mind to a deal that provides for the greatest exposure in the history of the State? Everybody wants the victims to get their compensation as speedily as possible, but can the Taoiseach reassure the House that a memorandum was brought to Cabinet, the Attorney General advised on it and that these terms were approved?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_134">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_256">I can do so. These matters were discussed by the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's office. The discussions continued over a long period. There was no rush deal in the last days of the previous Administration. The negotiations with CORI and the 18 religious congregations on the extent of the contribution began at the end of 2000 and concluded in the beginning of 2002. The drafting of the legal documents took time to complete and the matter was brought to Government on 5 June and made public that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The Government's approach on this issue was to see what was best for the victims in terms of redressing the wrong that was done to them. There was a clear view that many of their cases would not succeed in the courts because of the passage of time and the unavailability of witnesses. That led to the proposal of a scheme of redress based on medical evidence. The agreement with the organisations was that there would be €41 million cash. A total of €27 million has been lodged and a further €7 million is due this week. There would be €77 million in property transfers and the State can refuse any property offered and seek alternative proposals. That puts the State in a strong position. There was a further €10 million for counselling victims, with a commitment to continue the service over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The view of the agreement with CORI was that the contribution had to be meaningful but could not be so high as to destabilise the congregations, who do not have a bottomless pit of resources. The House will also remember that these congregations looked after the people in their care on behalf of the State. If there were deficiencies and problems, they were partially, and perhaps fully, the obligation of the State. Everything was done in an orderly fashion. Now, however, there are more cases than anybody expected. I well remember the day I made the apology on behalf of the State. I was told that day there would be no cases because it had nothing to do with financial redress but required an apology. However, that is how these things develop.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_259">The Taoiseach has rambled far and wide. I already have that information. I am asking about the indemnity deed, not the agreement. I am not asking what matters were discussed with the Department of Finance and the Attorney General. I am asking if the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's office were involved in respect of the indemnity deed.  A reply to a parliamentary question on 19 February 2002 gives the terms of the agreement but makes no reference to the fact that there is a global indemnity. It is so wide that it applies not just to putative cases that might be coming down the track but to anything that might have been forgotten and that cannot be thought about. The State has indemnified the congregations in those circumstances. I ask the Taoiseach, with the full consciousness of what he is doing, to tell the House whether a memorandum went to Cabinet, whether the Attorney General advised on the deed of indemnity and whether the Government approved it in the knowledge that the exposure of the State could be anything from a factor of five to, if you take the Progressive Democrats' position, a factor of 15-plus. I am puzzled as to why the Progressive Democrats would want to go public in disowning this if their own Attorney General was the central figure in approving it.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_260">To the best of my recollection, all of the people I have mentioned were involved. The indemnity deal, which I presume was the final legal document which was completed, was obviously discussed and dealt with in the legal section – it would not have been dealt with by a Minister. In terms of exposure, it was never clear what the figure would be. Various figures were mentioned over the past number of years, and they are still being mentioned. At one stage the figure was to be quite small, as I said, but then it went up by a sum in the region of €100 million each time. I do not know what the ultimate figure will be, but as far as the arrangements, negotiations and the legal indemnity are concerned, I am certain these matters were always brought to Cabinet.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">To follow up on earlier questions to the Taoiseach, to what extent is he aware of the sorties being carried out by US and UK war planes over southern Iraq on a daily basis and of the bombing of radar stations – which obviously leads to casualties – and civilian areas? To what extent is he aware of that aggression and the fact that it does not have a UN mandate? By participating in that aggression, Ireland is in breach of Article 28(3) of its Constitution which states: "Ní dleathach cogadh a fhógairt ná páirt a bheith ag an Stát in aon chogadh ach amháin le haontú Dháil Éireann". In other words, Ireland shall not declare or participate in a war save with the agreement of Dáil Éireann. Will the Taoiseach bring the Government into compliance with the Constitution on this matter, given that the State is already paying the Irish Aviation Authority for every military landing at Shannon and is thereby fully involved in the movements to date? Regarding international law, is the Taoiseach willing to support an escalation of the war in Iraq if a new UN resolution is not in line—</p>

          <p eId="para_271">As I said earlier during questions to the Taoiseach, it is the Government's view that UN Security Council Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002 should be complied with. We have not changed our position on that. Hopefully, following the events of the weekend, more time will be given to the weapons inspectors. It is now expected that they will report back on 14 February, so we must wait to see what happens then. It is the Government's hope, as we have always stated, that there would be a new UN Security Council resolution. That would of course have to be based upon what the inspectors say in their report, and I cannot say now what the likely position will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">In the meantime, the Government hopes that Saddam Hussein will listen to what the inspectors stated to him on 27 January, when they made it absolutely clear that while he was very good on the substance of some of the debate, he was not delivering on other matters. They asked in particular that he consider allowing scientists to talk to the weapons inspectors without the presence of Iraqi intelligence at such meetings. They also stated that they should be free to fly over parts of the country where they obviously wish to carry out checks. We will just have to wait and see what happens in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I do not have any security information on what is happening on the ground in Iraq or on its borders beyond what is in the public domain. The latest information I have is that inspectors will return to Iraq on 8 February to discuss their requests with the Iraqi authorities. Hopefully, they will get a positive response on those issues that will then form the basis of their report on 14 February. It will then be for the UN Security  Council to decide on the way forward. The Government's position remains the same. We await developments and will then return to the issue here. As I have always said, my preference is that Saddam Hussein would start behaving himself and give a break to his people and everybody else. This issue could then be resolved.</p>

Why was it only in January that the Air Navigation Order 1973 and section 3(17) of the Defence Act 1954, were signed in relation to munitions and uniforms from a foreign state passing through the country? In signing these, has the Government taken a view as to whether it will agree to participate in any further actions against Iraq if weapons of mass destruction are used by, for example, the United States, the UK or any member of the coalition? Which weapons of mass destruction would be unacceptable to the Taoiseach: the nuclear weapons that are allowed for in a classified US presidential directive; the daisy cutter bombs that incinerate everything within 300-600 yards; or the depleted uranium missiles which burst into flames on impact and disperse an aerosol of particles? Which of those weapons of mass destruction are unacceptable to the Government?</p>

There is no sign of the debate this week and we have raised it at the Whips' meeting. We were told that it would not take place unless something happened. I am not sure what that is.

Deputies will recall, in particular, in the period since 11 September, atrocities such as: the attempted suicide attack in December 2001 by the so-called "shoe bomber" on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami; the suicide attack in April last on the Tunisian island of Djerba in which 21 people died when a fuel tanker was detonated near a synagogue; the mass hostage taking at a Moscow theatre in October last which resulted in the death of more than 100 hostages; the bomb attacks in Bali, Indonesia, also in October last in which almost 200 persons  lost their lives and many more were injured; the bomb attack in Kenya in November last in which 11 people died, as well as the failed missile attack the same day on an Israeli charter jet with over 260 passengers; and the suicide bombing on 5 January in Tel Aviv in which 23 people died and over 100 people were wounded in an explosion adjacent to the old central bus station, which was the latest in a series of such attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Terrorism is not something unfamiliar to us in Ireland. We have long experienced domestic terrorism on this island and dissident republican and loyalist groups continue to pose a threat to the Good Friday Agreement and to peace. The events of 11 September were followed by a shared world-wide determination that the forces of terrorism should not prevail. There was also an early and widespread recognition that the response to the challenge of international terrorism represented by those atrocities would require concerted action and greater co-operation by the international community as well as action on the part of individual states. The determination to prevail over terrorism is reinforced by every subsequent act of terrorism as these attacks illustrate, in the most vivid manner, that international terrorism strikes at the heart of universal values such as peace, tolerance and freedom. Our response to these outrages must be to uphold and protect such values and to deny international terrorists the means and opportunities to launch attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Moreover, the terrible images and heartbreaking stories born of such atrocities serve as a constant reminder that we, as members of this Legislature, have our own duty to ensure that terrorists will find no comfort in this jurisdiction. Such a solemn duty merits strong action, not merely fine words. This will allow Ireland to fully play its part in the fight against international terrorism in keeping with the response of the international community as a whole to the events of 11 September 2001 and subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The response demanded by the nature of the 11 September attacks quickly followed from the international community. The United Nations has been the focal point in framing that response at the level of the world community, while the European Union has played the key role at regional level. That response has provided an important part of the context in which this Bill has been framed.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The United Nations Security Council, of which Ireland was a member, adopted resolutions 1368 and 1373 with the intention of creating a framework for action by the world community. Resolution 1368 condemned the attacks of 11 September 2001 and called on states to work together to bring the perpetrators to justice and to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Resolution 1373 specified a range of measures on which states are required to take action, especially in the area of combating the financing of terrorism. As part of those measures, the United Nations also called on states to  become parties to the relevant international conventions on terrorism and to co-operate, through bilateral and multilateral arrangements and agreements, to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks and take action against perpetrators of such acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The European Union also responded quickly to the challenge. Meeting on 20 September 2001, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed on a range of measures to be taken to step up the fight against terrorism within the European Union. Meeting the following day, the European Council approved a plan of action to this end. The fight against terrorism has remained a key priority for the Union in the period since and action continues to be taken on a wide range of fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Among the measures on which political agreement was achieved at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in December 2001 was a framework decision on combating terrorism. This framework decision, which provides for a common definition of terrorist offences, including offences relating to terrorist groups, was subsequently formally adopted by the Council on 13 June 2002. Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann had earlier approved Ireland's participation in its adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">We, on this island, have had to face the challenge of terrorism. Dissident republican and loyalist groups continue to operate and pose a threat. As a result, legislation already in place here is more comprehensive than that in many other countries. However, our legislation has been primarily framed with reference to the threat posed by groups indigenous to Ireland. In the changed environment created by the events of 11 September 2001, it is clear we need additional legislative provisions to counter the international terrorist threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I will devote some time to outlining the Bill, given its importance and provenance, and I ask for the indulgence of the House in this regard. Against that background and building on our existing legislation, the Bill is intended to enable this State to play its part in the fight against international terrorism. It will give effect to a number of international instruments directed to terrorism and will enable us to meet commitments which the State has undertaken as part of the European Union and the broader international community, including commitments arising from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Bill also amends our law more generally to enhance the capacity of the State to address the problem of international terrorism and makes provision for a number of additional measures directed, in particular, to the financing of terrorism. More specifically, the Bill serves three essential purposes. First, it will give effect in our law to the European Union framework decision on combating terrorism by making provision for the first time for terrorist offences to be defined as a separate and distinct category of offence in our law and by making provision for the application  of the relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, to terrorist groups who commit terrorist offences, whether based inside or outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Second, it will give effect to three United Nations conventions directed to specific manifestations of terrorism, namely, the Convention against the Taking of Hostages, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons and the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Third, it will give effect to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and will make ancillary provision for the purpose of combating the financing of terrorism by means of the creation of dedicated procedures allowing for the freezing of funds used or intended to be used for terrorist offences or terrorist groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I now propose to outline the Bill's main provisions by reference to these three essential purposes. Part 1 defines certain terms used in the Bill and provides for the bringing into force of the Bill when enacted. Part 2 will give effect to the framework decision on combating terrorism adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 June 2002. This framework decision is directed to the approximation of the laws of the member states in relation to a common definition of terrorist offences, including offences relating to terrorist groups. This new common understanding of what terrorism means will be important not only in providing a co-ordinated European Union-wide response to terrorism, but also in facilitating cross-border co-operation in tackling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Framework decisions are binding on member states as to the result to be achieved, but leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods and do not entail direct effect. The Bill, therefore, proposes to make the necessary provision in our law to give effect to the framework decision and, accordingly, provides for terrorist offences as a separate and distinct category of offence in our law by reference to definitions of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity". It also makes provision for terrorist groups by way of the application of the relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Acts to such groups and for enhanced penalties to attach to terrorist offences in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The definitions are outlined in section 4. "Terrorist activity" is defined by reference to offences under our law which are committed in or outside the State with the intent of seriously intimidating a population, unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The specified offences for the purpose of the definition of terrorist activity are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 and comprise those offences  under Irish law which correspond to the specified categories of intentional acts set out in article 1 of the framework decision. These are serious offences, for which persons are liable to be tried on indictment, involving violence against persons or property and related firearms and explosives offences or offences involving chemical or nuclear weapons. Likewise, the required intent for the purpose of the definition follows closely the wording of the framework decision itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">"Terrorist linked activity" is similarly defined by reference to certain other specified offences under our law committed in or outside the State for the purpose of engaging in terrorist activity or in connection with the activities of terrorist groups by reference to the relevant offences under the Offences against the State Acts. The specified offences for this purpose are set out in Parts 2 and 3 of the second Schedule and comprise those offences which correspond to specified categories of intentional acts set out in article 3 of the framework decision, that is, offences of aggravated burglary and robbery, blackmail, extortion and certain forgery offences. "Terrorist group" is defined by reference to the framework decision, that is, a structured group of more than two persons, established over a period of time and acting in concert to commit terrorist offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Section 6 makes provision for terrorist offences by reference to those definitions and in keeping with the requirements of the framework decision. Subsection (1) provides that a person who engages in terrorist activity or terrorist linked activity inside or, in certain circumstances, outside the State, is guilty of an offence. It also makes attempting to engage in terrorist activity or in terrorist linked activity and threatening to engage in terrorist activity inside or outside the State an offence. The effect of the definitions of terrorist activity and terrorist linked activity will be to require proof of the commission of the relevant underlying offence, together with proof of the special intent, for that to become a terrorist offence or terrorist linked offence as the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The circumstances in which terrorist offences committed outside the State will be offences in our law are governed by subsections (2) and (3) and correspond to those circumstances in which article 9 of the framework decision requires us to take extra-territorial jurisdiction. Extra-territorial jurisdiction will also be exercisable in circumstances where a request for extradition has been made and is refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Subsection (4) of section 6 provides that subsection (1) will not apply in respect of the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict in so far as those activities are governed by international humanitarian law, or the activities of military forces of a state in the exercise of their official duties in so far as those activities are governed by other rules of international law. Similar provisions are made in relation to the UN Convention offences dealt with in Part 3 of the Bill, in  keeping with the relevant requirements of those conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Subsections (5) and (6), recognising the special difficulties that can attach to proving offences of specific intent, also make provision for certain circumstances in which the existence of the intent required for the purposes of committing the offence of engaging in or attempting to engage in terrorist activity may be presumed to exist, subject to the right of the accused to rebut that presumption. Subsection (7) makes provision for co-operation in respect of prosecutions in relation to terrorist offences in circumstances where more than one member state may have jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The penalties which will apply to persons convicted of terrorist offences are set out in section 7. This provides, in keeping with article 5 of the framework decision, for enhanced penalties in certain circumstances by reference to the penalties imposable for the same offence when committed without the special intent required for terrorist offences. The penalty imposable will be the same where it is a sentence of imprisonment fixed by law or imprisonment for life, but enhanced maximum penalties will be available in all other circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Section 5 makes provision for terrorist groups, as defined in section 4, by way of the application of other relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Acts to such groups whether based inside or outside the State. This will allow the requirements imposed by Articles 2 and 9 of the framework decision to be met in keeping with our existing law directed to unlawful organisations. It is also in keeping with a recommendation of the Committee to Review the Offences against the State Acts which was that the Government should have power to make a suppression order in respect of foreign terrorist organisations. The section provides that terrorist groups will be unlawful organisations for the purposes of the Offences against the State Acts and that the relevant provisions – including, for example, provision for the offences of membership and directing an unlawful organisation – will attach equally to terrorist groups, as will the power of the Government to make suppression orders in relation to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Part 6 makes provision for certain amendments to the Offences against the State Acts which are directed principally to the requirements of the framework decision. These include provision for a new offence of providing assistance to an unlawful organisation in section 51. That offence will be committed where a person knowingly renders assistance to an unlawful organisation in the performance or furtherance of an unlawful object. A person found guilty of this new offence will be liable to the same penalties as those provided for in the case of membership. This provision flows in part from a recommendation in the report of the committee to which I have referred which recognised that there could be cases where persons are closely associated with unlawful  organisations and actively further their ends but are not, or cannot be proven to be, members of the organisation. It is also in keeping with the concept of participation in a terrorist group used in Article 4 of the framework decision which would not necessarily be fully met by the existing offence of membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The second such amendment to which I refer is being made by section 50 of the Bill to increase the maximum penalty for membership of an unlawful organisation to €3,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months in the case of a summary conviction, and an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for up to eight years in the case of a person found guilty on conviction on indictment. This meets a requirement in Article 5 of the framework decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The framework decision is explicitly stated as not being intended to amend the obligation to respect the fundamental legal principles enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which has reference, <i>inter alia,</i> to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, which are common to member states, as well as to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I hope it will be clear from what I have just said that the provision being made in the Bill for the purposes of giving effect to the framework decision on combating terrorism should not give rise to concern on the part of those who seek change in our society or who engage in legitimate protest.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Bill does not, as has been suggested frequently and irresponsibly elsewhere, define terrorism as any activity which unduly compels a Government or international organisation to change course. Nor does it define terrorism as any activity which destabilises or destroys the fundamental political economic or social structures of a state. The Bill does not, therefore, and is not intended to, criminalise the anti-globalisation movement because that movement is seeking to reform world trade. Nor would the Bill have had any application to the anti-apartheid movement because it campaigned for the replacement of the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Bill does not make it an offence to seek change, nor does it make it an offence to have a cause. We value the right to espouse causes in our society and the Government will continue to defend that right, including the right of persons to espouse causes and views with which the Government itself may disagree. The Bill will, in its own way, protect such persons from those who would threaten that right. What is not legitimate – and where the Bill draws the line – is where persons or organisations engage in concerted campaigns of violence in support of such causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Bill does not criminalise conduct which would not already be an offence under our law, except to the extent that it provides for the taking of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the limited cir cumstances I have outlined. What the Bill does mean, however, is that people and organisations who have recourse to serious offences involving violence such as hijacking, explosives offences and murder – with the intention of intimidating a population, unduly compelling a government or international organisation, or seriously destabilising or destroying a state or international organisation – will, in keeping with that intention, be guilty of a terrorist offence instead of the offence which they would otherwise be guilty of under our criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The purpose of Part 3 is to enable Ireland to become party to three United Nations conventions which are relevant in the context of the international effort against terrorism. I have told the House already what they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Convention-specific offences are being created in this Bill for the purpose of each of the three conventions in order to ensure full compliance with the requirements under each convention, including the requirement to take extraterritorial jurisdiction. These offences will in certain cases supplement existing offences under our law directed to the same or similar conduct. They will at the same time ensure that any gaps as between existing offences, and the offences as defined in the convention, are bridged.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Sections 9 to 11 provide for the new offences. Section 9 provides for the new offence of hostage-taking. It provides that a person is guilty of the offence of hostage-taking if he or she, in or outside the State, seizes or detains another person and threatens to kill, injure or continue to detain the hostage in order to compel a state, an international intergovernmental organisation, a person or a group of persons to do, or abstain from doing, any act.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Section 10 provides for the offence of terrorist bombing. It provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she, in or outside the State, unlawfully and intentionally delivers, places, discharges or detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into or against a place of public use, a state or Government facility, a public transportation system or an infrastructure facility with intent to cause death or serious bodily injury or with intent to cause destruction when destruction results in, or is likely to result in, major economic loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Section 11 makes provision in relation to internationally protected persons. It will be possible to rely on existing offences under our law for the purpose of meeting our obligations in relation to offences committed against internationally protected persons in this jurisdiction. Section 11, therefore, makes provision for the taking of jurisdiction in respect of those offences when committed outside the State in certain circumstances by reference to the relevant domestic offences set out in Schedule 6 to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Sections 9 to 11 also make it an offence to attempt to commit the substantive offence while section 11 makes it an offence to threaten to commit an act which would be an offence under that  section. Persons guilty of the offence of hostage-taking or terrorist bombing will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life. Persons guilty of an offence in relation to internationally protected persons under section 11 will be liable to be punished by the same penalties which are applicable to the offences if committed in the State. The offence of threatening to commit an offence carries a sanction of imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The three sections also make the relevant conduct an offence when committed outside the State in certain circumstances. The approach to extraterritorial jurisdiction in all three conventions is largely similar although there are some differences as between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The third key element of the Bill is the measures contained in Parts 4 and 6 intended to give effect to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and aimed at combating terrorist financing more generally in keeping with our obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and the financial action task force recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The key provision in the Bill for the purpose of giving effect to the convention is section 13, which makes provision for the new offence of financing terrorism and which gives effect to the definition of that offence in Article 2 of the convention. It also goes beyond the requirements of the convention to include the financing of terrorist groups as defined in section 4 and terrorist offences within the meaning of section 6 to the extent that these are not covered by the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The jurisdiction provisions in section 13 correspond to both the mandatory and the discretionary jurisdiction requirements in Article 7 of the convention. The one exception is that they do not apply to the framework decision element of the offence; this element is covered by the jurisdiction provisions of sections 6(2) and 6(3). The definition of "funds" in Article 1 of the convention is reflected at section 12. It is a comprehensive definition covering assets of every kind with the emphasis very much on financial transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Part 4 also provides for two distinct and dedicated procedures for the purpose of giving effect to Article 8 of the convention and to our wider obligations under Resolution 1373. Both procedures are court-based and build on existing provisions of our law. The key difference between them is that the first will enable an application to be made to freeze funds intended for use in committing terrorist offences independently of criminal proceedings, whereas the second will be available for use in conjunction with such proceedings in respect of the new offence of financing terrorism. The two procedures will therefore complement each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Provision for the first of these procedures is made in sections 14 to 20 and will enable funds which are being used, or which may be intended to be used, for the purpose of committing terrorist offences, including the offence of financing ter rorism, to be frozen and ultimately made subject to a disposal order in favour of the State. The procedure closely mirrors the existing provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 under which the High Court can order the preservation, and where appropriate, the disposal of property which constitutes the proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Section 14 will accordingly enable the High Court to make an interim order prohibiting a person from disposing of funds for a period of up to 40 days where it is satisfied, on foot of an <i>ex parte</i> application to the court by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána, that a person possesses funds that are being used or may be intended for use in the commission of a terrorist offence or a terrorist financing offence. Section 15 will enable the High Court to make an interlocutory order extending the period during which the funds are frozen unless satisfied, by any person claiming an interest in those funds, that they are not intended for such use or that there would be a serious risk of injustice. Section 16 will in similar circumstances enable the High Court to make a disposal order in favour of the State where an interlocutory order has been in force for a period of not less than seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The Bill also makes provision for a statement by a chief superintendent that he or she believes funds are being used or are intended for use in committing or facilitating the commission of a terrorist offence to be evidence, provided that the High Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for that belief. In addition, it provides for the payment of compensation, as the court considers just, to a person in respect of any loss incurred by a person in respect of orders made in accordance with the procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The second procedure in Part 4 of the Bill to which I referred is contained in sections 21 to 43, inclusive. These provisions provide a statutory framework which will enable the confiscation, restraint and forfeiture provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to be applied for the purpose of the new offence of terrorist financing. It is necessary to legislate in this way as the existing relevant provisions of the 1994 Act only allow for the confiscation and restraint of the benefits derived from drug trafficking and the benefits from an offence other than drug trafficking. The Bill amends the 1994 Act to provide a dedicated procedure for the purpose of the offence of financing terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The effect of the amendments will be that where a person has been convicted of and sentenced for an offence of financing terrorism, the Director of Public Prosecutions can apply to the court to determine whether the person holds funds subject to confiscation. The expression "funds subject to confiscation" is defined in section 8A of the 1994 Act, which is being inserted into that Act by section 22 of the Bill, as funds used or allocated for use in connection with an offence of financing terrorism, or funds that are the proceeds of such an offence. Also, in line  with the drug trafficking and other offences provisions of the 1994 Act, the standard of proof applicable in civil proceedings is the standard required to determine whether a person holds funds subject to confiscation and, if so, the amount to be recovered, in other words, on the balance of probability.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The 1994 Act also contains important provisions directed to the prevention and detection of money laundering. Section 32 of the Bill amends the relevant provisions of the 1994 Act to extend the obligation on financial institutions to adopt measures for the purpose of preventing and detecting money laundering to also cover the prevention and detection of the offence of financing terrorism. Likewise, under section 38, the obligation on financial institutions to report to the Garda Síochána any suspicion of money laundering is being extended to include an obligation to report any suspicion of an offence of financing terrorism being committed in connection with their business. These provisions will provide an important means by which the existence of terrorist funds may come to light and provide a basis for recourse to the procedures for the freezing of those funds which I have just outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Another section in Part 4 I wish to mention is section 44 which empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations directed to freezing terrorist funds in order that enabling Acts adopted by the institutions of the European Communities for this purpose can be given full effect. The real significance of section 44 is that it provides for an indictable offence for breach of the regulations. At present, breach of the regulations can only be tried summarily. This provision will have particular application to the measures adopted within the European Union for the purpose of giving effect to UN Resolution 1373.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Part 6 of the Bill will also make provision for another important element of the package directed at combating the financing of terrorism by way of an amendment of the Offences against the State Acts. The Bill will allow existing provisions of those Acts which have application to the property of unlawful organisations to be applied to terrorist groups. Certain additional measures are also being provided for in the Bill, including in section 53 provision for a procedure directed to the recovery of the property of unlawful organisations in respect of which a suppression order has been made which stands forfeited to the Minister. This procedure, which will be court based, draws on the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1985 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 for inspiration and is intended to complement the procedure under the 1985 Act which applies to the moneys of unlawful organisations held in a bank. It includes a provision allowing any interim order made by the court to be challenged by any person claiming ownership of the property and for the payment of compensation in appropriate circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Sections 52, 54 and 55 of the Bill make certain other amendments to the Offences against the State Acts for the purpose of combating the financing of terrorism. These include updating the definition of property in line with other provisions of the Bill and amendments to the 1985 Act to ensure it will be available for use as circumstances require.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">These are the key elements of the Bill which contains certain other procedural provisions as well as consequential amendments to a number of other Acts to which I could also refer but I am conscious that I have already spoken at length. There will be an opportunity to deal with any queries Deputies may have in relation to those provisions in my reply or on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">My reasons for speaking at such length about the Bill are the circumstances and context in which it has been prepared, the complexity of some of its provisions and the manner in which they relate one to another. In addition, there has already been a tendency on the part of some to misrepresent the Bill and suggest it is directed at ordinary, peaceful, democratic activity, the free expression of convictions and free political association. I hope my comments will assist the House in its task of considering the Bill which is important, not least because it will equip the State more fully for the purpose of responding to the threat posed by international terrorism but also because it will enable the State to honour important international commitments and play our full part, as a member of the international community, in the fight against terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">This country still faces terrorist threats from both within and without. I intend to ensure our law is such that Ireland harbours neither a terrorist threat from within directed at ourselves or others on the islands nor persons intent on abusing the hospitality they receive here to plan international terrorist offences of the kind we have witnessed and which I mentioned. I welcome the contributions of Members from all sides to this legislation, particularly any contribution which will make the Bill fairer, more effective, just and efficient. I will consider amendments and proposals from any quarter. I hope the House joins me in ensuring the Bill gets a speedy passage through the Legislature. Important though it is and extensive though its powers may be, it is directed towards ensuring Ireland is not a society within which those planning to kill other innocent people can find legal loopholes through which to carry out their cowardly plans. I commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I hope the Minister deems my contribution useful. The Bill bolsters domestic law dealing with international terrorism, not just because of the events of 11 September 2001 but  also due to events listed by the Minister: Tunisia, Moscow, Bali, Kenya and Tel Aviv. There is also continuing domestic terrorism. We will seek clarification of some issues as we move through the sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Bill allows Ireland to join the international community in dealing with terrorism under several conventions. It also defines terrorist acts as those aimed at intimidating a population or compelling a Government or international organisation to alter its course or seriously destabilising political, economic or social structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">There are probably three main areas covered by the Bill. First, it gives effect to the EU framework decision on combating terrorism which was adopted last year and makes specific provision for distinct categories of terrorist offences – serious offences which carry a terrorist intent. It looks like the penalties have been enhanced – doubled in many cases – in comparison with sentences for offences already on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Adopting the EU framework is appropriate. It makes sense that we approximate EU law in this area when we deal with terrorism. There are some valid questions arising regarding sentences under the framework. They should be cleared up.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">In section 6(4), the Bill exempts activities of the armed forces in two situations – during an armed conflict and when performing their official duties. With regard to the armed forces during an armed conflict, they are exempt in so far as those activities are governed by international humanitarian law. With regard to the armed forces of a state performing their official duties, they are exempt in so far as those activities are governed by other rules of international law. It is difficult to understand the reason for differentiating between international humanitarian law and other rules of international law. Is it suggested that armed conflict be governed only by international humanitarian law whereas armed forces in the exercise of their official duties are subject to international law, except for international humanitarian law? If so, why?</p>
          <p eId="para_464">With regard to sentencing, Article 5 of the EU framework decision obliges member states to ensure that terrorist offences as defined are punishable by custodial sentences heavier than those imposable under national law for such offences, in the absence of the special intent required pursuant to Article 1.1, except where the sentences imposable are already the maximum possible under Irish law. Section 7 of the Bill provides for imprisonment not exceeding 20 years if the corresponding offence at national law is punishable by a sentence of up to ten years, imprisonment not exceeding 15 years if the offence at national law is punishable by a sentence of up to seven years and imprisonment not exceeding ten years in any other case.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The effect of this is to allow judicial discretion as to the sentence to be imposed on conviction, so long as the sentence does not exceed the specified period. The effect of the section is not to guarantee that a person committing an offence under the  Bill will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment longer than that which he or she might have been sentenced to for a similar offence not connected with terrorist activity. In that light, it is arguable that the Bill fails to implement Article 5 of the EU framework decision. A more effective wording might be to provide for sentences of not less than X years and not more than Y years.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Section 7 further provides for the imposition of life imprisonment on conviction for sentences for which the mandatory life sentence applies at Irish law. The implementation of the mandatory life sentence in this jurisdiction has not always been as stark as the strict terms of the sentence might suggest. In some situations, in order to guarantee imprisonment for significant periods, it might be more effective to specify a fixed term of imprisonment. The Minister might deal with that in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Another broad area concerns the conventions mentioned by the Minister. The Bill creates new offences of hostage taking, terrorist bombing and offences against internationally protected persons such as diplomats, as the Minister has said. That makes sense and Fine Gael supports this section of the Bill. My only question concerns the length of time taken for the conventions to be adopted. The convention on the taking of hostages was adopted by the UN in 1979, that on the prevention and punishment of crimes against internationally protected persons was adopted in 1973, that on the suppression of terrorist bombing was adopted in 1998 and that on the suppression of the financing of terrorism was adopted in 2000. Why has it taken so long to adopt these conventions?</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The financing of terrorism is a further broad area. The Bill provides for the freezing and confiscation of funds where it is shown that the funds in question are being used, or may be used, in committing or facilitating those terrorist offences described. There is a question here with regard to the system placing a burden of proof on the respondent in some cases, which is outside the norm. The usual procedure in Ireland is to place the burden of proof on the applicant and questions have been raised regarding the infringement of civil liberties such as the right to a fair trial, and regarding private property. This should be clarified. I understand there are similar provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. They are largely mirrored in those Acts but there could be further explanation or clarification in the context of the concerns which have been raised regarding civil liberties.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">In the explanatory memorandum, it appears that the member of the Garda Síochána who makes the application to the High Court, in the context of this section of the Bill, should be of chief superintendent rank. That is not reflected in the Bill which refers to applications being made by any member of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The Minister has spent some time reflecting on the criticisms made in the press, especially with  regard to those taking part in an anti-globalisation demonstration. I agree with the Minister and do not believe that anything will change in this regard because of the legislation. The Bill clearly covers crimes with specific terrorist intent and legitimate protest will not be affected by it. Too much has been made of this. The Nelson Mandela scenario has been mentioned but, looking at this, our extradition laws do not allow for someone to be sent back to a situation where persecution exists. I agree with the Minister in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Fine Gael supports the Bill and looks forward to clarification of the issues I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_472">I will not go into the finer detail of the Bill but feel I should say a few words on it. I welcome the Minister and his commitment to deal with this matter. I know from the Minister's background that he is totally committed to dealing with the issue of terrorism and its national and international effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I was frustrated and annoyed last week by a matter unrelated to this Bill but to the Minister's stature in the Dáil and the community. He tried to defend the indefensible when he said that Deputy O'Dea, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, could wear two hats and be an ordinary Deputy at home, wheeling and dealing with major problems, yet wear a different hat in this House. However, we are dealing with a Bill that has very serious international connotations and will ensure that Ireland can get involved with the European Union and other jurisdictions to ensure that crime of this type is dealt with in a positive and constructive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">When one looks back at the events of 11 September, it is a miracle that so few Irish people were directly involved in a country where there are a vast number of people of Irish descent. That did not make it any easier to accept that terrorists could cause such mayhem and destruction but it proved beyond doubt our need to be part of a global effort to ensure that terrorism has no safe haven, in Ireland, the European Union or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I was not the best at geography when I was at school and I did not know about a place called Bali until I heard about the 2,000 deaths there. I was surprised at the number of people I met shortly afterwards who had been to that holiday resort on holiday or honeymoon and who had enjoyed it. It was terrible that terrorists could kill so many people in such a short time. It had a devastating influence on the economy of that area, but it will survive. As one who was born and reared close to the Border and who continues to live there, I know better than most how such events can affect an area. I remember the railway, the canal and the road around Clones being closed at the same time which meant that economic activity could not take place as there was no access to the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">One of the advantages of being involved in farm organisations was that I was part of lobby groups and protests which some people say this Bill opposes. However, that is not the case. All such protests are legitimate. They are essential to ensure that we, as politicians, and others know about the problems which exist. It is stupid to suggest that any such group could be the victim of this legislation. My involvement with the European Union made me committed to the different treaties to which we have signed up and which have been passed by this House. The European Union is of major benefit to us. It was great that the European Union reacted quickly and introduced this legislation after 11 September. We can rest assured that our involvement in such structures means we are more important now than we were when we first became involved in 1973.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">We are all worried about how money from drugs is spent. I am glad that is dealt with in the Bill. Another major issue, particularly in the Border region, is how money from oil laundering is spent. That practice puts many legitimate businesses under threat and much damage can be done. We all know the history of money laundering in this country and the fact that those who were suspected of it were not always involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Another major issue is the financing of terrorism. One wonders why there is in-fighting in loyalism in Northern Ireland. That proves that terrorism is not always on one side or the other. Terrorism leads to a demand for finance. While this Bill is broader than the Irish context, it is important that we examine these issues in the near future. The amount of money accumulated and the way it is spent is frightening. I am glad the Bill provides for terrorist funds to be frozen, even if it is only suspected that the money might be used for terrorist purposes. That might help us to avert terrorist acts. The Garda Síochána or the force of law in whatever jurisdiction must get support to ensure such funding is confiscated. We are often given lectures about spending money, although it may be little, but we are talking about millions which have been made through these systems. Such money must be controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The Bill gives life sentences to those involved in hostage taking or terrorist bombings. That was one area of the Good Friday Agreement which annoyed me. It was terrible that people from all sides of the divide who were identified as being involved in heinous crimes, such as bombing churches, pubs, etc., were granted full release from prison. I hope that the people involved in such activities get life sentences and that they are detained for life. I would not have been as annoyed if the other elements of the Good Friday Agreement, such as decommissioning, had been fully met. We must strike an even balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The legislation provides for an increase in fines. Perhaps the Minister could examine this issue to which Deputy Deasy referred. It might be possible to look at maximum and minimum fines. It is crazy that people in my area can get off if they pay money to the court poor box. The  justice system is laughable in that regard. I know it is a national and local issue, but it is still relevant to the debate. Perhaps the Minister could consider introducing maximum and minimum fines. It is all right to increase fines, but unless people expect a minimum fine, they will not be afraid of the system. It is demoralising for people who want to maintain law and order if people get off scot free.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It is important to be able to freeze terrorist funds. I am not well briefed on the Bill because I am not a legal expert, unlike the Minister and many other Members in the House. However, I support its general thrust. As a result of my involvement in the European Union, I realise the benefit of working with other nations. They may not all be perfect and others may contradict what I have said, but we have benefited greatly from our involvement in Europe. I remember when my former party leader, who was also Taoiseach, made drugs the main issue which had to be dealt with. He wanted to ensure that law enforcement agencies could work in different jurisdictions. This Bill is similar in many ways. It will allow us to play our part in ensuring that international terrorism is controlled and that the world is a safer place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_482">The Labour Party supports the Bill. As the Minister outlined in his address, the legislation was introduced against the background of 11 September in the United States which was tragic, devastating and traumatic. We sympathise greatly with the people of the United States in the tragedy they suffered from what one can only describe as terrorism of the worst possible kind. The Minister outlined a number of other instances of extreme and violent acts of terrorism in various parts of the world, including the Paris to Miami flight, the Tunisian island of Djerba, Moscow, Bali, Kenya and Tel Aviv. In that list there is a preponderance of terrorism perpetrated on the American people. In putting legislation through the House it behoves us to consider it in the broadest possible context, considering not just the here and now but also the future implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The twin towers holocaust brought the notorious organisation, al-Qaeda, to public notice. It was swiftly pursued to Afghanistan by the United States which has now directed its attention at Iraq, claiming that al-Qaeda is hosted by the Iraqi President and his regime. There seems to be very little evidence to that effect because of the totally polarised attitude of one secular society with an Islamic background and other fundamentalists, as in al-Qaeda. That is one aspect of the case we have to consider in the context of a looming war.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">We also have to consider the situation in the light of events in Palestine, a country in which Ireland has always taken great interest as a small country whose people, by and large, have been deprived of a homeland. Many of the terrorist atrocities that have taken place, not only in recent months but also in past decades, were not directed at the American people and we did not  bring forward legislation such as is now before the House. Very often, they were directed at other targets, particularly the Israeli economy and its airlines, involving kidnapping, hostage taking and the Munich killings. Undoubtedly, there is a fundamentalist aspect to the worldwide terrorism of recent decades which arises from that conflict. A speedy resolution of that conflict would be ten times better than any legislation in any country to rid the world of terrorism. I note that the Minister is nodding his head in agreement that actions are better than any law which, at best, is a blunt instrument and can only operate in extreme crisis situations. My basic point is that we need to consider the situation in the broadest context. We should urge the people of the United States for whom we have the greatest sympathy at this time to look at the causes of the conflict. The United States Administration should not rush into an ill-considered war against an enemy which does not appear to be the source of terrorism against the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">We have international commitments which we must observe, whether they arise from the international community through the United Nations or the European Union. The Bill relates to EU decisions and UN conventions. We should satisfy ourselves that we have the appropriate legislation. The issues which have been outlined include bombing, hijacking, hostage taking, money laundering and financing terrorism. Undoubtedly, all must be dealt with. As the Minister said, EU framework decisions are binding on member states as to the results to be achieved but leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods and do not entail direct effect. Essentially, the directive is binding on Ireland but we still have a great deal of scope and freedom as to the presentation of its provisions, the mechanisms we use and what protections we introduce, provided we achieve the intended effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Bill strikes me as very stark legislation for the world stage, rather than being appropriate to our little country which is neutral. It speaks as if the enemy was at the gates, as though our country had been close to large-scale terrorist activities all the time and as if we were in imminent danger. Legislation should only be introduced when it has a particular purpose. If it is not relevant, it simply brings legislation into disrepute. I wish to refer to some areas that have given rise to public concern and pose the question as to whether we have got the best deal in this regard or whether perhaps we need to look at the Bill more carefully. There is not much point in passing legislation only to find that in the process we may have infringed certain rights in relation to assembly, protest, strike or other matters of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Section 4 is critical in this context in the definition of terrorist activity. It refers to an act committed inside or outside the State with the intention of seriously intimidating a population. I would never have anticipated a definition of terrorism in the terms used in the Bill –"intimidat ing a population, unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act". I always thought it was the function of the Opposition to, duly or unduly, compel a Government to take some action or abstain from it, as the case may be.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">There are no terrorists on this side of the House. Perhaps the term might have some reference to a certain Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The Bill also refers to "seriously destabilising a government". Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on what happened on 30 June, in what was probably one of his first acts as a member of the newly formed Government. The European Council of Ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed on the framework decision referred to in the Bill. How did it come up with these types of terrorist activity? All the other United Nations conventions do not have wordings of this nature. This wording seems to trawl much wider. It is a catch-all wording which could apply to a multitude of activities, whereas the wording used in the other conventions seems to be tighter and more specific. Section 6(5)(<i>b</i>) states, “The accused person shall be presumed, unless the court is satisfied to the contrary, to have committed or attempted to commit the act with that intention.”</p>
          <p eId="para_492">"Intention" and "presumption" are strange words and difficult to accept easily in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Then there is the term "corresponding offence", in the last paragraph of the same Part, where the normal rule of law will apply. The Bill states, ‘ "corresponding offence", in relation to a person convicted of an offence . . .  means the offence for which the person would have been liable to be convicted had the act constituted the offence under that section been committed in the State in the absence of the intent . . . ". In other words, the corresponding offence is now being determined by the intent referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>). Therefore, the intention to commit a terrorist offence is the determining factor. I wonder how the Minister will determine from where this intention will come, how it will be determined as distinct from evidence, the intent and the presumption of that intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">On the Council framework decision contained in the Schedule, it seems there is a contradiction in the definition of terrorist group. Article 2 states a terrorist group is "a structured group of more than two persons". I suppose two persons do not constitute a terrorist group. I am wondering why the Minister decided it should be "more than two persons", seeing as most public order legislation speaks of two or more persons. Why does it further state that a terrorist group is "established over a period of time"? Could it not be established at a particular time?</p>

It could be a better Bill but at least we will at last after 50 years be implementing the convention. We certainly do not need to enact one piece of legislation which undermines another. The Special Criminal Court is our home-grown contribution to the directive. I am sure all the Ministers who attended the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 13 June did not tell the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he had wonderful legislation in Ireland establishing the Special Criminal Court and that they would incorporate it as part of their legislation in implementing the framework decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">Clearly, this is an extension of the Special Criminal Court. If I remember correctly, in 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement was being passed, one of the commitments made was that all special and emergency legislation, including the Offences Against the State Act and that relating to the Special Criminal Court, would be looked at with a view to normalising legislation on the island in order that jury trials would become not just the norm but also the only manner in which we would deal with offences in Ireland, as is the case in the neighbouring jurisdiction and most other countries. We are now moving in the opposite direction and extending  the remit of the Special Criminal Court and trials without juries. I am not saying that is wrong in the context of terrorist offences but it is wrong if there are not enough protections to ensure our citizens are safeguarded. They might be on the streets to demonstrate against globalisation or on behalf of peace. It could be the third level students who will march tomorrow against the imposition of third level fees and something might get out of hand, although I would not expect that demonstration to come within the remit of this legislation. Nevertheless, we could be applying the Special Criminal Court to a range of new categories of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The Hederman committee was established to review the workings of the Special Criminal Court and produced an interim report. I am not sure what happened to the final report. There was a minority report and a majority report. Perhaps the Minister will outline what proposals the committee made arising from the Good Friday Agreement for normalising legislation here. None of the other countries in Europe has introduced a special criminal court to deal with terrorist offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">With regard to financing terrorism, I welcome the convention on money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. We have made substantial progress in this area and, through the Criminal Assets Bureau, in dealing with assets criminally obtained. I have no problem with the remit of that legislation being extended. The forthcoming Proceeds of Crime Bill will also be welcome. Our party has pioneered action in this area and I welcome these measures which are part of the action being taken to combat the financing of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I do not have concerns about the United Nations and other international conventions. I doubt that anybody on this side of the House has concerns about dealing with terrorism, as long as it is terrorism. It is strange that we are not just talking about states but also about international organisations. Where and what are the international organisations to which this legislation applies? The only international organisation which has been subject to threat is the World Trade Organisation. There have been substantial protests and violence erupted in Genoa last year and earlier in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">There seems to be an aim in this legislation to deal with protests that might be considered over-vigorous. I am worried that it could be interpreted in that way. It is one thing for the Minister to say that this is not his intention, that his inten tion is purely to ensure terrorists are dealt with expeditiously but once the legislation is in place it is there to be interpreted. The wording in section 4 and part of the Schedule is so loose as to be capable of interpretation in a way that might cause Irish citizens to be hauled before the Special Criminal Court, declared a terrorist organisation and their activities declared to be terrorist activities. It could greatly affect the constitutional entitlement to free assembly and protest that is part and parcel of our democracy. While I know that is not the Minister's intention, I have that concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I hope the Minister will respond to my concern about the looseness of the wording of the directive, in the first instance, and the broadness of the wording of section 4 of the Bill. Will he be willing to accept amendments that would tighten up those sections in order that it will be clear that they are not intended to be a catch-all provision that will enable a future Government to deal harshly with citizens who are, in fact, engaging in normal democratic practices?</p>

          <p eId="para_529">The war on terrorism worries me in the same way that the war on drugs a few years ago and the war on communism worried us. I worry that we will see resources that can be better used in other areas being diverted into a slogan and an endeavour that will divert attention from more fundamental issues that have to be dealt with. In the 1950s the McCarthyite tactics used in the war on communism were good for getting votes and useful for making political decisions to the then Establishment in the United States. More recently, Ronald Reagan during his term of office as President declared a war on drugs that has continued for 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I do not believe the war on drugs or a war on terrorism can be won. Underlying the war on terrorism is a more difficult issue to address, the fundamental inequalities that exist in the world. By diverting resources to the war on terrorism we will, unfortunately, fuel the fires that allow terrorism to thrive in the first place. Shortly after the events of 11 September 2001 the United States committed itself to establishing a new Department of Homeland Security which is now using billions of dollars of funding which could be better used in other areas. Massive amounts of money are going into the detection of terrorists  in towns and cities across the United States. It has reached the point where there are radiation detectors in the New York subway that are stopping patients suffering from particular complaints, for which they have an implant, from using it.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Many resources are going into the war on terrorism. If a scintilla of the activities and funds going into the war on terrorism were diverted into addressing social and economic inequalities around the world, we would cope with the threat of terrorism far more effectively. In a sense, even the preparation and production of a Bill like this distracts us from other issues we should be addressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I am concerned about the broad brush definitions used in this Bill. I am concerned at the attempts to define terrorist activity and at the kind of activities that are being used within the relevant Irish legislation. For example, there is a reference to terrorist and terrorist-linked activity within Part 1 of the Second Schedule, and reference is made to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. I took the trouble of looking up section 14 of that Act, which deals with endangering traffic. Section 14(1) of that Act states:</p>
          <p eId="para_533">A person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally places or throws any dangerous obstruction upon a railway, road, street, waterway or public place or interferes with any machinery, signal, equipment or other device for the direction, control or regulation of traffic thereon, or interferes with or throws anything at or on any conveyance used or to be used thereon.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">That would cover throwing a snowball at a bus on a wintry day such as today. It is a very broad and dangerous definition. It could be used against those who walked onto the runway at Shannon Airport and created a shrine with rosary beads and Muslim prayer books. It could be used against any of those who participated in the Reclaim the Streets demonstration of May 2002. It is a very broad definition. I am sure that the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would not abuse the legislation but I do fear that in the wrong hands, the legislation could be used in a draconian manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Having taken part in many demonstrations involving non-passive direct action over the years, I worry that it could be used against colleagues past, present and future. I recall a member of the Garda Síochána threatening me with the loss of my American visa when I had the music on too loud at a party. That was an abuse of the then legislation. Thankfully the garda in question did not know that I hold dual citizenship of the US and Ireland. It goes to show that, in the wrong hands, legislation can be abused, and that is a real danger with the Bill before us today.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_537">That was the point at issue actually. Legislation can be abused and we need a much more focused degree of definition. With the rise of anti-globalisation campaigners internationally, there has been a move towards the control of legitimate protest, particularly in states that have moved to the right in recent years or where right of centre parties have been in Government. I worry when that happens, whether it be the control of protesters at the WTO summit in Genoa, protesters trying to protect a national monument from severe damage at Carrickmines or pacifists trying to stop US planes at Shannon Airport. I worry that this legislation could be used in such instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties also have concerns about this Bill. It certainly needs to be tightened up on Committee Stage. We see, on the one hand, the push to get anti-terrorism legislation through but, on the other hand, we see other international treaties that we are moving very slowly on. Deputy Costello mentioned the European Convention on Human Rights. I wonder about the undue haste with which this Bill is being pushed forward. There are fairly draconian measures within the legislation and we should slow down and think long and hard before pushing such broad brush legislation through the Oireachtas. As one writer asked in an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few weeks ago, would Nelson Mandela, had he sought sanctuary here, found himself the victim of the Offences against the State Act or, indeed, of this Bill had it been in place at the time? This legislation could be misused in the wrong hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I intend to address more of the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage but the first Part of the Bill is a significant concern at this stage. The definition of the Act is so broad it could be used against Fossett's Circus. The definition of "activity" is so broad it could be used against somebody throwing a snowball—</p>

          <p eId="para_541">Only for a terrorist purpose, but the definition of a terrorist purpose in the legislation is also rather broad, and I am not convinced that the Minister has given sufficient time to ensuring that the Bill will not be abused by his successor, perhaps, or by somebody else. My party wants to see significant changes to the proposed legislation. I do not doubt the intent of the Minister or the seriousness of the threat of international terrorism. However, the US is stepping up its plans for a war that may cost in the region of $100 million. If we spent a scintilla of that in addressing the root causes of terrorism in countries that are significantly disadvantaged and underdeveloped, we would do far more to address the threat of terrorism.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I am not alone in criticising this Bill or other anti-terrorism legislation  that has been rushed through in the aftermath of 11 September, not only in this country but in many other states in Europe and throughout the world. Many organisations are critical of this rush, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. With this legislative rush, human rights protections are being eroded. Serious damage has been done in other states in terms of freedom of expression, protection of refugees and the laws of war, for instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Another negative trend has been allowing the military to commit acts of terrorism in peace time. Such activity is not covered in this Bill and will not be covered, it appears, by the International Criminal Court because some states are looking for an opt out and others are allowing those states to opt out of the International Criminal Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Most of the definitions in the Bill are too broad, vague and ill-defined. Tá Sinn Féin ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo toisc go bhfuil an Rialtas, d'aon ghnó á dheifriú tríd an Dáil, ainneoin go bhfuil impleachtaí ag an mBille i leith ár gcearta agus ár saoirse. Níor foilsíodh an Bille ach díreach roimh Nollaig agus tá gá le han-chuid dian scrúdú a dhéanamh air. Ba chóir go mbeadh díospóireacht fhada againn air seo agus ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil deifir ar an Rialtas an Bille a chur tríd an Teach. Chomhlíon an Rialtas a dhualgas idirnáisiúnta nuair a foilsíodh an Bille roimh deireadh na bliana seo caite.</p>

Cá bhfuil an deifir chun an coinbhinsiún Eorpach ar chearta an duine a bheith fréamhatha i dhlí na hÉireann? Deirtear go bhfuil sé ag teacht suas ach cén uair a thiocfaidh sé? Cén fáth nach bhfuilimid ag déileáil leis inniu agus cén fáth gur léim an Bille seo thairis?</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Tá deifir ar an Rialtas an Bille seo a rith tríd an Dáil.

Ba cheart go mbeadh am againn déileáil leis an mBille i gceart agus leis an easpa atá ann, an easpa mhíniú cheart ar Bhillí. The Government wishes to fast-track this Bill but why does it not fast-track the Education (Disabilities) Bill or the Convention on the Protection of Children? Many important Bills need to be fast-tracked.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Sinn Féin has problems with many aspects of this Bill, one of which is its attempts to deal with a definition of terrorism offences or terrorism. This is a problem that many other conventions, protocols and international treaties have tried to tackle. Even the UN terrorism prevention branch cannot suggest a commonly acceptable definition. We need to be careful that we do not go beyond  where the United Nations wishes us to be or we impinge on other people's rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The UN policy working group on terrorism has cautioned against labelling political opponents or adversaries as terrorists. In the past the label "terrorist" has been used to demonise or de-legitimise different groups and activities. Such activities include protests at WTO meetings or actions carried out at Shannon Airport or in other countries. The mere facts of political objectives, violent action or the destruction of property are insufficient for the purposes of a definition of terrorism.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">The specific reference to an international organisation in section 4 and other parts of the Bill seems to have been formulated to specifically target the anti-globalisation protesters who have dogged WTO meetings. Do we really want legislation that looks at these radical protests in the same way as the attacks on the twin towers?</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Section 5(1) makes the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts apply.  Definitions in sections 5 and 6 are very broad and, like section 4, go beyond the requirements of the Framework Document. It is dangerously unclear as to what constitutes advocacy in section 5(1) or attempting or threatening to engage in section 6(1). Likewise, what constitutes membership, providing assistance or directing an unlawful organisation? These are not defined. Will there be a proscription list? Will it be made public and subject to review?</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Under this legislation, even Mahatma Ghandi could have been found to be a terrorist for blocking a railway or road, thus endangering traffic. All that would matter under this legislation is that he blocked the road and intended to convince the British to vacate India. The Catholic workers who engaged in a non-violent symbolic protest at Shannon Airport yesterday could be construed as terrorists for engaging in property damage under section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991, for the purposes of compelling the Government from refraining from an act. While Deputies may agree or disagree as to whether such actions are legitimate, surely we can reach a consensus and agree that the people concerned are not terrorists. This legislation is dangerous in that it also narrows the space for non-violent opposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">When discussing this Bill, it is essential that all views are carefully listened to and human rights are always at the top of the agenda. There has been a recent tendency to turn our backs on human rights because of certain world events. Legislators should never be bullied or intimidated into supporting legislation that is against the public good in the long term. We should never be forced into knee-jerk reactions to events. Sound legislation is always based on justice, equality and truth from which we can never walk away.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">With the global swing to the centre-right, I know it is not fashionable to be in favour of human rights while civil liberties seem to have gone out the window. It is time for cool heads and brave leadership. The last 30 years have proved that we need to be careful and clinical in framing our legislation. We have seen bombs in Dublin resulting in legislation being forced through the Dáil. We have seen shortcuts taken with human rights leading to cases such as those of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven and the Nicky Kelly case. They are a warning to us all of the deep and careful consideration we have to take of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The principal purpose of the Bill is to enable effect to be given in our law to the European framework decision on combating terrorism and the international convention against the taking of hostages. The Bill also deals with a number of measures directed at the financing of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">When we use the word "terrorism", it should always be directed at people and states which deliberately attack civilians with no regard for life or limb. Every state, community and citizen has  a right to protect itself or himself or herself when attacked but this should never be used as an excuse to use violence against innocent civilians. We should never be afraid to speak out against states, particularly those in the European Union, which have the brass neck to talk about terrorism, or legislation on terrorism, while their record shows they were involved in collusion, planting bombs in Dublin, blowing up the <i>Rainbow Warrior,</i> or raping or murdering the people of Chechnya or Palestine. We cannot allow states to get away with this type of hypocrisy – they must be challenged.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">I agree with the second half of the Government's amendment to the motion which deals with opposition to the Fischler proposals. Fine Gael is opposed to the Fischler proposals. Our agricultural community bought into an agreement in Agenda 2000 to base its farm projections on that agreement. However, we are opposed to it because we do not agree with decoupling or modulation and we believe that many of the reports that have been published are based on false assumptions. We also believe that the nice rhetoric used by Commissioner Fischler concerning emphasis on quality is an aspect that could have been addressed within the current CAP system.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">In addition, Commissioner Fischler continually reiterates the importance of a new system when he goes to the WTO, but we point out that the American farm Bill provided for putting $40 billion into agriculture in America, which would seem to contradict the line used by Commissioner Fischler.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The CAP is basically an agreement between the member states of the EU to protect farmers by paying subsidies to fix prices of farm products. It attempts to ensure an adequate supply, a stable market, a fair price for the farmer and a reasonable price for the consumer. It is important to realise that the ultimate beneficiary of subsidies is the consumer, a fact that many commentators fail to realise. Subsidies which are provided by taxpayers come back to them in the form of cheap food.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">We are not here to debate the second half of the Government's amendment to our motion but to debate our motion and the first half of the Government's amendment to it. It is important to realise that not all agricultural policy is made in Brussels. The Government has an input and can influence how the industry operates. We are here to prosecute the Government for its failure to live up to its commitments to the agricultural community.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">We are also here to complain about the failure of the input by the national Parliament on agricultural issues. One of the topics covered at length during the Nice referendum debate was the lack of Government accountability. In recent weeks a document was passed to the Committee on Agriculture and Food dealing with rules for negotiation on the agricultural input into the WTO. However, by the time that document came before the committee it had been accepted by the Government the previous day or the Monday beforehand, which I ask the Minister and his staff to bear in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">It is important to realise that agriculture is an important industry. Some 200,000 people are employed in the agri-food business. It accounts for 9.5% of our gross domestic product. We have agricultural exports of €7 billion, but the industry has experienced difficulties in the recent past. While our economy doubled in size in the 1990s, the agricultural industry stood still and, on close analysis, one could say it regressed. In the 1980s the gross value added to agriculture was 23% or 2.3% per year. However, in the 1990s it was only 6% or an average of 0.6% per year. This industry regressed at a time when our economy doubled in size.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Farm incomes have decreased – last year they decreased by 8.5%. During the tenure in office of the Government parties, from 1997 onwards, farm incomes have fallen behind those engaged in other industries. They have fallen behind the average industrial wage and those employed in the public sector. Others could argue that other sections have done well, and perhaps they have, but the farming community has lost out.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Those in the agricultural community sought support from the Government and thought there would be an understanding of their position. Consumers spend in the region of 20% of their disposable income on foodstuffs. However, such consumer spending has decreased by 1% per year over the past five years, which presents another difficulty for the agricultural community.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">In fairness to the Government, the agricultural community was in difficulty so it held out the hand of friendship and produced the programme for Government, which with perhaps the exception of one point was based on the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. Despite claims by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, that he helped to negotiate the programme for Government, I must hand it to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, that he outbid the Minister of State on it in that the Mini ster of State appears to have been responsible for the inclusion of only one point in it, classification of the BMW region as disadvantaged. Up to November the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, had not sought to even make representations to have the counties of Laois and Offaly, which he represents, included in that programme. I do not know if that position has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I must table a parliamentary question on this matter. In a reply to a parliamentary question – I do not have the reply with me – the Minister stated that no Minister or Minister of State had made representations for additional area to be classified as disadvantaged. I hope I will not receive a letter on that matter from the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, in the next few days. Up to the middle of November, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, failed to secure such a classification despite giving a commitment to his constituents in the run-up to the general election that he would do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The programme for Government refers to the opening of the markets. I was not a Member of the Dáil during the 1995 to 1997 Government, but from the few snippets of the proceedings of this House that I saw on television, I recall two members of the then Opposition from Cork East, Deputies Ned O'Keeffe and Michael Ahern, were up and down like popcorn on a hot range calling for markets to be reopened. What have they done since they went into Government? Were it not for the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain our beef industry would have collapsed altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The famous <i>Marie Celeste</i> set off for Egypt in April with a cargo of 65 tonnes of beef. The opening of the Egyptian market was announced with great fanfare in September 2001. One shipment was made in April 2002, but no shipment was made prior to or since that date. Deputy Cregan should use his influence with the Minister to change that.</p>

I will not go into too much detail on this because I do not want to embarrass the Minister, but on close examination it will be found that that shipment was heavily subsidised, which means that basically it represented a false economy. We have been unsuccessful in opening up markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The Minister said that Teagasc would be dedicated to the improvement of agriculture, but the Government reduced Teagasc's budget by €12 million. The Government spoke about progressing the organic industry, but due to the cutbacks in Teagasc the agricultural college in Athenry, which is in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, may have to close.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">Probably more will have to close. I did not believe it was possible to close any more,  but it appears the Government can achieve the impossible.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The Government said that Bord Bia would promote Irish food abroad, which is important, and Bord Glais would promote the vegetable industry, but I note there is a reference in one of today's newspapers to amalgamating and streamlining those agencies. The Department seems to be led by the so-called three wise men.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The Government said that the beef industry is underpinned by the national beef assurance scheme. When I was preparing to speak on this motion, I wondered where I would get material. I was disappointed to realise we would have only 120 minutes to deal with this matter. It is not in my nature to be critical, but I noted the swarm of material on this issue relating to schemes that have not been implemented. I noted that the beef industry was underpinned by the national beef assurance scheme, which was passed in the Dáil in 1998, but which has not been fully implemented, not to mention the national dairy herd certification scheme, which has also not been implemented. Our dairy industry lost out last year, of which the Minister, given that he comes from Cork, will be aware. That scheme must be brought back on stream. There was a the drop in dairy prices – at a rough estimate, €32 million was lost in the past year to the economy of County Cork, which is responsible for about 25% of our diary output. That loss is equivalent to in the region of 1,200 to 1,300 industrial jobs losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Government spoke about protecting the environment. It allocated €234 million for the REPS, but only spent €175 million on it. That scheme is co-funded by the EU, which means that we lost €30 million in that regard. The Government referred to making REPS a more attractive scheme, but I have yet to see that happen. People are not taking part because the inputs have increased and it is not worth their while doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Minister spoke about assisting in farm investment, yet there was a cutback of €23 million in this scheme which deals with farm waste management and other structural deficits that need to be addressed to improve our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The national development plan reminds me of the Treaty of Limerick and the famous quote: "The treaty broken, ere the ink wherewith 'twas writ could dry."  It is the same with the national development plan and the programme for Government. Like the national spatial strategy, there is nothing in the national development plan for agriculture. Even if there were, it would not matter because none of it is being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The Government said that, as a matter of urgency, we should consider introducing tax incentives to encourage young farmers to lease land. I know the IFA made a submission on this to the Minister before the budget. I did not see anything on it in the budget, but perhaps there will be something in the Finance Bill. However, from what I have seen to date, I would not hold out much hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The budget abolished roll-over relief. The "A lot done" section of the Fianna Fáil manifesto clearly outlined how it had set out a nice agreement on capital gains and capital acquisitions tax for people who had land taken from them or who sold it. However, the "More to do" section of the manifesto did not include the fact that Fianna Fáil would abolish tax relief. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, flew through that when making his Budget Statement. Members of the Government were not aware of it. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who was party to the agreement, certainly was not aware of it, although he tried to distance himself from it in the following weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The straw that broke the camel's back was the Dáil resolution increasing the bovine diseases levies. It did not amount to much monetarily –€10 million – but it was a breach of faith. This was an agreement into which the IFA and the farming community had entered with the former Minister, Ivan Yates, in 1996, when the system was changed and the levies decreased. The current Government raised them again by 1c on milk and an additional €2 on animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">That struck a chord with people. Here was a community that wanted assistance and sought something that could be provided by the Government, and all that was given was the abolition of roll-over relief. Everyone should pay their taxes but there is something fundamentally wrong about a person having to pay tax on the proceeds of the sale of an asset, the disposal of which he or she is required to do against his or her will. Will the Minister use his influence between now and the publication of the Finance Bill to address that difficulty?</p>
          <p eId="para_596">As regards the tractorcade, I do not know how the Minister did it but he turned a low-key, borderline successful protest into a remarkable success. It was another fantastic achievement. The Minister said the average farm income was €45,000. I sincerely hope we will not negotiate in Brussels in the months ahead on the basis of that figure. Teagasc came up with the figure of €15,800. We should put this issue to bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I do not know who advised the Minister or whether he took it upon himself to undermine the protest. Had he been upfront on the first day, recognised that there were difficulties and said he would do his best to solve them, the protest would never have been as successful as it was. He made the protest.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">We are having this debate to show that the Government made many commitments which it did not keep. The Ministers of State, Deputies Aylward and Treacy, acknowledge this privately. As a confidence building measure, the Minister should revisit the bovine diseases levies issue as an act of good faith. I know he will have the support of the honourable Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, because through the rhetoric during the tractorcade, he certainly gave the impression that he would support it. The Minister will also have the support of the honourable Deputy Ned  O'Keeffe. He stood up on a tractor in Mitchelstown and I hope he stands up for the farming community now by speaking in favour of this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">It is only a question of €10 million. The revised bovine diseases levies were introduced on the basis of the Exchequer returns forecasts. The figures turned out to be much better than anticipated. To revise the levies would send out a positive signal that could result in farmers entering the partnership agreement. It is important that they be a part of it. I understand why they are not because they feel there is no point in being part of it if they get nothing from the Government. The Minister should revise the levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The problems of agriculture do not begin and end with the Minister. I remember in the previous Dáil as junior Fine Gael spokesperson on defence that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, made a living out of telling us that the helicopters were coming and that the contract had supposedly been signed with Sikorsky. The new Government had barely been formed before he was out of the traps saying the helicopters were not coming. Then the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, made his announcement. He is being used as a crude instrument of government to hit the vulnerable agricultural community. The Taoiseach's thinking is that agriculture should be hit hard to obtain money from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Come June of next year after the EU Presidency, the Taoiseach will reshuffle his Cabinet and I would like to think he would retain the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in some form. However, he will probably cast around to identify someone with a lean and hungry look. He may go over the Healy Pass to south Kerry and choose the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has of late been giving dissertations on dinosaurs, a subject with which he would be familiar being a dinosaur on the political landscape himself. Unfortunately, unlike prehistoric dinosaurs, he has left considerable evidence of his tenure in office in the form of crime figures. The Taoiseach may also go further up the road and choose the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív. Many in the rural community like him, he would go down well with them and the difficulties the Government has created for the farming community might be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I would say to the agricultural community not to be fooled and to remember the hard times and how the Government put the boot in. They should not fall for the rhetoric of Government and blame the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for their problems. They are of the Government's making because it took a conscious decision to remove money from the sector.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I second the motion so ably moved by my colleague, Deputy Timmins. The reality is that life on the land is not good and never before has agriculture been in such a decimated state. The Government is running away from the crisis  in farming and has delivered nothing to restore incomes. In the wake of the fight at the Cabinet table and in Brussels, the Government has failed miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">It must listen to what is happening on the land. The reality is that 300,000 jobs depend on agriculture, not just in farming but throughout the agricultural industry in sales, marketing, distribution, co-operatives and other businesses in rural areas. Several towns and villages depend heavily on agriculture for their well-being. Thousands of jobs outside farming are at stake if the Government does not take heed of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The bottom line is that farm incomes have fallen way behind others. The average farm income is less than €15,000 per year compared with average industrial earnings of €26,000. Average public service pay is €37,000. Farm incomes have fallen from three quarters of average industrial earnings in the mid-1990s to little more than half, or 56%, of same in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Farm product prices have taken a hammering. Since 1995 cattle prices have fallen by 22%. I could go back further to when the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, sold cattle in Mountbellew or Tuam. He knows how much prices have fallen since then.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">Milk prices are down 9%, pig prices by 10% and grain prices by a whopping 30% since 1995. Livestock farmers have a chronic low income problem. Last year dairy farmers and grain growers probably suffered the most disastrous year in the past 50 years. In the past ten years 22,000 farmers have been forced out of full-time farming and had to get off-farm income because farming, as a way of life, no longer pays them. Young people are not coming into farming because they cannot earn a decent income to bring up a family. Only 13% of farmers are under 35 years of age. Agricultural colleges are closing. Rockwell Agricultural College at the heart of my constituency, in the county with the best farming land in the country, is no longer there. The college was closed under this Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_610">Inflation is destroying farmers' income. The Government has failed to bring it down. The price farmers get for their products is failing, but inflation is running at between 5% and 6%. Living standards are being eroded every year. The year 2002 was a disastrous one for farming. Farmers' incomes were down by 8.5%. That means a cut of more than 13% in living standards when inflation is taken into account. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has claimed that farmers' incomes increased by 39% in two years. The Central Statistics Office figures show the increase  at 13%. Let the Minister and the Government be judged on their record. Since Deputy Walsh became Minister for Agriculture and Food in 1997, farm incomes have not kept pace with inflation. Average farm incomes have risen by 5.4% over a period when inflation was in excess of 20%</p>
          <p eId="para_611">At a time when farming was on its knees, the Government put in the boot with the budget, which hit the farmers to the tune of €20 million with the disease levy. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Environmental schemes like REPS and the farm investment scheme have been cut by €136 million compared to the Government's commitment in the national development plan. Forestry investment was slashed by €16 million and this has had a huge impact on an area that offered a different way of farming. The early retirement scheme has been affected and the list is endless. The National Roads Authority agreement is the real problem and we in south Tipperary have been affected by it hugely. The way that was cut back was disgraceful. People did not want to sell their land, but they were forced into an agreement. Throughout County Tipperary people are extremely hurt by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The mushroom industry, which has developed hugely, particularly in my part of the country, is having a very severe problem with labour shortages. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, announced cutbacks that are having a devastating effect on those people. The Minister for Agriculture and Food should look at that, because it will close down an industry that has brought considerable vibrancy to parts of my constituency.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_613">This motion is very appropriate and timely. It comes at a time when we are facing a major challenge with the Fischler proposals and with the next WTO agreement, both of which go hand in hand, despite the fact that Commissioner Fischler seems to be ignoring totally what will happen in the WTO.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I had the experience of being in the Department of Agriculture and Food from 1994 to 1997. It was a time of hope and optimism and a time of buoyancy in the agricultural industry. 1995 was a record year for agricultural income, which was sustained for 1996 and 1997, despite the problems with BSE at that time. All sectors were buoyant at the time and no sector was under pressure. The various schemes, including REPS, were being introduced and taken up enthusiastically. When I left that section of the Department there were 46,000 people in receipt of REPS. Now there is nothing but depression in rural Ireland. People have lost the fire in their bellies.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I have sympathy for the Minister and the two Ministers of State, all three of whom I know. Being at the Department of Agriculture and Food at this time is a no-win situation. People have said there was a major lobby to keep Deputy Walsh as the Minister for Agriculture and Food. It was unfortunate that lobby was not try ing to have him put into some other Ministry. He may have been there in good times but he will leave the Department of Agriculture and Food in drastic times.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">It is depressing to listen to the pessimism among young farmers who see no hope whatsoever. This includes people on farms with 100,000 gallon quotas. The price of beef has collapsed. The price of milk has been reduced dramatically and this will continue. In north Kerry, the Kerry Group is subsidising the price of milk by about ten cent and the chairman recently said farmers should be given ten cent less per gallon as he is losing on it. It is all about management.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I admire John Dillon. The action now being taken by the IFA should have been taken five years ago. I will say one thing about the Minister's skills at negotiating. He has embraced the IFA and brought it into the Department. When the Minister left office in 1994, the IFA said it found it very difficult to communicate with Deputy Walsh. However, he successfully adopted a different attitude. In the meantime the farmers of Ireland suffered and were at a loss. The action being taken by John Dillon, as leader of the IFA, should have been taken five years ago. The same pessimism among the farming community would not be there now if that had happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The forestry sector is very important to the farming community. The funding available for forestry has been cut by 22% from €106.4 million to €82 million. No approvals for new plantings have issued since last October. This reduction in the provision for forestry will have devastating effects on the farming community. This was one area where farmers were making some income. Dr. Richard Moloney from UCC has estimated that a cut of €24 million in the forestry budget will mean a total loss to the rural economy of in excess of €44 million, which will lead to the loss of 1,160 rural jobs. If a factory were to close tomorrow with the loss of that number of jobs there would be uproar in this House, but there is not a word about the loss of these jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Of the 15,147 hectares of land planted nationally in 2001, some 2,017 hectares were planted in County Kerry, which represents 13% of the national total and was worth about €6 million in direct grant aid to cover the cost of the initial planting. Farmers will receive about €650,000 tax-free in premium payments annually over the next 20 years from the 2001 planting alone. This is critical income for the farmers concerned. The level of planting in 2003 could be reduced to 1,000 hectares in County Kerry, which would result in the loss of between 25 and 30 permanent and part-time jobs and the loss of premium payments to farmers over the next 20 years. As a rural Deputy, it is very painful for me to state the whole rural economy is in chaos and disarray and there is no one to lend a helping hand.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_620">I support the motion. Family members involved in farming and the few constituents of Galway West left in farming have left  me in no doubt that morale in the sector is at an all-time low.  The IFA organised a well marshalled, peaceful tractor cavalcade to Dublin last month which did not go over the top and the Minister promised those involved he would address their grievances in the national partnership talks. He was quoted on television this evening welcoming the talks, while the president of the IFA, Mr. Dillon, stated the ball was in the Minister's court. It is time this matter, another of the Government's broken promises, was sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Deputy Deenihan expressed sympathy with the Minister and his Ministers of State at the position in which they find themselves in the Department of Agriculture and Food. He should show more sympathy for the farmers and farm families of Ireland who are very disappointed by their failure to deliver to the farming community.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Recent developments are all about politics, electoral strength and voting numbers. In the eyes of the Government, the rapid diminution of the farming vote means the farming lobby and community can be ignored. There is a great deal more attached to the farming community, its vote and the prosperity of agriculture than the incomes of farmers and farm families. Rural towns depend on a prosperous agriculture sector. We do not have one. It is almost impossible for the children of farmers to remain on the land. They see their brothers, sisters and neighbours working regular hours and receiving regular incomes. Farming is in a depressed state.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The Dúchas proposals in the framework for farming would have a negative effect on the farming part of my constituency, which is mainly located in Connemara. It is proposed that livestock farmers will have to take livestock off the commonages, winterages and mountains between November and May. In other words, the livestock will have to be housed. This would make this traditional style of farming in Connemara uneconomical and, therefore, impossible. It would wipe out the cattle population in Connemara because it would be unviable for farmers, for example, with ten suckler cows and some followers, to have to house their cattle in the winter months. I ask the Minister and his Ministers of State to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Some €30 million allocated for the REP scheme was not drawn down. Why do we not improve its attractiveness to help farmers in difficult areas such as Connemara to draw down the money available from Brussels? It is not drawn down because the scheme is not sufficiently attractive.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">The Minister and his colleagues may not like to hear it but the Government's record to date in agriculture is appalling. I will not single out a particular Minister or attach full responsibility to one of them because the Government is collectively responsible for the position in which we find ourselves. I have repeatedly witnessed colleagues of the Minister scapegoat him and his Ministers of State for our problems and have been told it occurs throughout the country. The reality is that in the lead-up to 17 May promises were made at meetings with the IFA, ICSA and ICSMA and little has been delivered since. Farm families now realise that these promises were of little value.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">My constituency of Laoighis-Offaly is in the Shannon region where, as the Minister will be aware, farmers must constantly struggle against repeated flooding of their land. Some areas have been flooded for months at a time with devastating consequences, yet the Government did not provide an aid package after the most recent flood. Those affected are being ignored despite the fact that their land is unusable and their crops are ruined. They also have the added expense of finding feedstuffs for their stock. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">To return to the meetings held before the general election on 17 May, farmers heard a great deal about disadvantaged status, an issue raised by my colleague, Deputy Timmins. To be fair, one or two Ministers were brave enough to state what they understood to be the genuine position with regard to improving our disadvantaged status. Not everybody in government, however, was so open and honest about what could be done. In reply to numerous questions on the issue since the general election the Minister has said he is considering the question of disadvantaged status and that, under the programme for Government, the Government will try to have the entire BMW region included. It is farcical that a farmer on one side of a ditch is covered by disadvantaged status, while a farmer on the other side is not. People are expecting progress on this issue. When will they see it?</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Some of my colleagues referred to the REP scheme. From numerous conversations, I have discovered that the poor take-up of the scheme is due to its bureaucracy. While I am aware the Minster has made some efforts in recent months to address this and accept that he wants to ensure changes in the scheme are robust and fully justifiable, this process will be time consuming. I cannot see how the problem can be resolved by initiating another consultative process to examine the scheme. This is more likely to add red tape than remove it. I have yet to hear warm praise for the recent changes. During a meeting with the IFA  last night to discuss REPS the IFA was adamant that the scheme remains unattractive to the vast majority of farmers because of the bureaucracy involved and the conditions it imposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Another scheme which, if properly implemented, would have huge potential is the early retirement scheme from farming. To work as envisaged, older farmers would be encouraged to retire and younger farmers would take up the scheme. However, applications are being rejected for the most ludicrous reasons. Last year I learned of a woman who was refused entry to the scheme because she omitted to get section 12 consent from the Land Commission. In response to a parliamentary question tabled by another Deputy last year, the Minister stated consent had not been refused by the Land Commission at any time in the past five years, yet an application for the early retirement scheme was rejected because such consent, which is nothing more than a rubber stamp, was not provided. An entire section works to rubber stamp sheets of paper while applications are being refused for not containing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The application of another person was delayed for almost a year because it included the certified copy of her birth certificate instead of the original. While I accept this is a mistake, it is madness to delay an application for that length of time. It would be much simpler if someone picked up a telephone and informed the applicant that the wrong certificate was included and requested that the correct one be forwarded. The current position creates more work, red tape and expense for all concerned and makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The scheme is of very little value to farmers. Since the introduction of the second scheme, they have received only slightly more than when it was originally introduced, which means it is not viable for many of them. Because of the amount of work involved, most farmers have to get a solicitor, an accountant and an agricultural adviser to fill in the application form. By the time they have paid those people, the first year's payment is gone. I could go on to deal with roll-over leases and so on but I will conclude.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">I have no doubt I will. As Deputy Timmins said, it is important that we discuss our major natural resource industry in this House on a regular basis. The record of the Government speaks for itself and completely belies the motion put down by the Opposition. Any reasonable observer would have to conclude that the Government, by its actions, has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the development of agriculture. The Government's approach has always been founded on the unique importance of the agriculture industry in terms of sustaining rural Ireland and as our major natural resource-based industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I would like to outline the Government's commitment to farming and the manner in which that has been demonstrated in a concrete fashion time and again. For those suffering from selective recollection, let me remind the House of some of the actions we have taken in recent years. We mobilised the entire resources of the State to fight the foot and mouth disease threat, which could have devastated Irish agriculture – this was an outright success; we put into immediate effect the cattle destruction market support schemes, involving the use of substantial Exchequer resources, to support the beef sector and producer prices during the BSE crisis of 2001 and 2002 – these schemes cost in excess of €400 million; we have adopted, and continue to adopt, a hands-on approach to the reopening of markets for agricultural produce, involving the full deployment of political, diplomatic and technical resources; we developed and implemented, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, traceability systems for cattle, sheep and pigs to provide state-of-the-art food safety guarantees for consumers of Irish products and provide a marketing edge in increasingly competitive markets—</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_645">—we put in place one of the most efficient systems in the EU for payment of direct income payments to farmers with the vast bulk of cheques now issuing on the first day allowed under EU regulations – no other member state administration matches this level of service; we negotiated, against all the odds, what has been universally acknowledged as a most favourable outcome for Irish farmers in the Agenda 2000 CAP reform; we copperfastened the Agenda 2000 gains in the recent Brussels summit decision on the future financing of the CAP securing direct payments to 2013; we successfully defended  export refunds in the WTO negotiations at Doha; we are providing €2.8 billion in public expenditure to support the agriculture sector in 2003, of which €1.6 billion will be paid in direct payments to farmers – a similar amount was spent last year; we have continued to allocate substantial Exchequer resources to control animal diseases in the national herd – in excess of €200 million will be spent again this year; contrary to suggestions from some quarters, we provided increased financial provisions this year for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the on-farm investment schemes and are committed to further improvements in these schemes; we operate the early retirement scheme and the young farmer installation aid scheme, unlike some other member states, and in addition we provide tax incentives and a full exemption from stamp duty to facilitate the early transfer of land to young farmers; and we published and implemented a long-term plan for Irish agriculture, the Agri-Food 2010 Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">None of this detracts from the fact that following two good years, last year was a particularly difficult one for farming. By way of immediate response to the weather and market-related difficulties a series of special actions were initiated by the Government as far back as last May. I will spell those out again.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In 2002 we obtained EU agreement on a number of occasions to significantly strengthen market supports for dairy products. Refunds for skimmed milk powder, for example, increased on six occasions and casein aid increased by a total of 80%. I got Commissioner Fischler to make those amendments following representations made to me by the farming and dairy co-operatives. Dairying was still depressed last year and were it not for those improvements, it would be in a much worse position; we secured EU agreement to allow the use of set-aside land for grazing-fodder; we negotiated the lifting of the Russian county ban on beef exports; we obtained EU agreement to allow an increase by up to 30% in beef export refunds; we secured EU approval to have the advance payments under the bovine premium schemes increased from 60% to 80% this year; we brought forward, with EU approval, advance payments under the arable aid scheme; we made administrative changes to simplify the REPS, including investment by the Department of Agriculture and Food of €1.3 million to facilitate planner access to computerised mapping; we introduced improvements to the farm assist scheme; and we made changes to reduce the paperwork for farmers in applying for extensification premia.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">That was all done during 2002, going back to last May. Those actions were taken in response to the difficult weather and market conditions and they resulted in tangible benefits  to farmers, although not as much as we would like. I welcome the sober and constructive attitude on the part of Opposition members, which is only right when we are dealing with a complex and difficult industry like agriculture and farming. We are not in isolation here in that regard. We have to compete with EU member states. We will have an enlarged Union in 12 months' time and we have competition also from third countries so it is an industry that has to be taken extremely seriously – I appreciate the seriousness with which the Opposition members made their contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">One of my main priorities is to continue to ensure the optimal framework for the development of agriculture and to seek the best possible supports to ensure adequate returns for the farming community. However, we have to recognise a number of facts. First, direct income payments support farmers' incomes to a very considerable extent. For example, direct payments have increased from €485 million in 1990 to the €1.6 billion paid to farmers last year. It is not accurate to say that product prices have not improved since the mid-1990s. Any decrease has been made up with increased payments in premia of various descriptions. I think it was Deputy Tom Hayes who said these subsidies and premia are important because they provide cheap food to consumers. I would prefer if food was much cheaper and I would like the farmers to get a much greater slice of the profit margin but our supermarkets are obtaining the largest slice of the profit from that whole operation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_652">In relation to many of the products, that is up to 36% and what is left for the farmers is totally inadequate. Second, while these payments make up a considerable amount of the average farm income, farmers and processors in particular have not kept pace with the changes that have taken place on the farm. Compared to a decade or two decades ago, most farms are totally transformed. They are in pristine condition and they produce the highest quality products whereas in many factories, the position is roughly the same as it was a decade ago. That is not good enough because beyond the farm gate we have to maximise the profitability of the product and get that profitability in greater amounts back to the farmers. That is the reason I have initiated a study of the dairy industry. The study is complete and I should have it in the next two weeks because we need to keep pace with the very positive developments that have taken place at farm level.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Third, we have to recognise, especially when considering average incomes, the diverse nature of the farming sector, which is comprised of full-time and part-time farmers, and if comparisons are being made with other sectors, it is important to compare like with like.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">On the question of partnership, there is no doubt that the poor weather and market conditions in 2002, a series of proposed reforms and trade changes at international level and the negotiation of a new national partnership agreement have made for an apprehensive time for the farming community. Every business wants a calm, predictable economic climate in which future plans can be made and brought to fruition and farming is no different. Farmers also need that security and stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">There has been much talk about the social partnership talks, the manner in which they have been conducted and the draft agreements. I emphasise that in these national negotiations no group has received what they initially sought and those who have received awards, primarily in the pay area, must in return give significant concessions in terms of new work practices and productivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The farm organisations came to the negotiating table with a package of requests which in another economic climate may have been addressed, but as many of the pillars have discovered, such demands would have cost the Exchequer billions of euro in increased borrowings. Certain demands from the pillars were unrealistic in the current climate and could not under present economic conditions be conceded. I know the farm organisations would agree, as would the rest of Irish society, that there should be no return to excessive borrowing. We had plenty of that in the past and farmers suffered more than most.</p>

          <p eId="para_662">To indicate the comprehensive approach taken in relation to agriculture there are solid commitments on the CAP mid-term review, WTO, the dairy sector, the beef sector, the food industry, improvement in REPS, improvement in the farm waste management scheme, commonage framework plans, SACs, stamp duty and stock relief for young farmers and land annuities.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">To give an example of the type of approach which has been taken by the Government, I cite the instance of the increase in the disease levies. Like any other consumer of services, farmers do not like to have to pay more. However, this  increase in levies must be placed in the context of a steep rise in the cost to the Exchequer of disease eradication measures in recent years. Over €200 million was spent in the last couple of years on disease eradication. Up to now, €10 million was contributed by way of levies and that has now been increased to €20 million in an overall expenditure of €200 million.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_665">The 1996 agreement was mentioned earlier. I will quote from that agreement's subhead E: "For an extra year levies will be fixed on the basis that they will contribute £10 million per annum or 50% of the cost of compensation, whichever is the greater."  Compensation last year cost approximately €50 million and 50% of that is a long way from €20 million. That was negotiated in 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">To alleviate the problem an offer has been made, within the partnership process, to the farm organisations to partake in a series of value for money reviews of expenditure. These reviews would take place this year to identify savings for both the Exchequer and farmers while protecting consumer health, animal health and animal welfare and complying with statutory requirements. Much progress can be made using this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Another area where there is a large degree of misinformation relates to Brussels-funded schemes and the claim that hundred of millions of euro of EU funding could be lost to this country. It is true that REPS expenditure is behind schedule but this reflects low demand – my Department has turned no one away.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_669">There is time to rectify this situation and I point to this country's track record in drawing down such funding which is the envy of many other member states. Again, within the partnership process and with the draft agreement in place, there is a mechanism to draw down the maximum level of funding and to optimise the spending of EU and national budgets. Ireland's reputation for drawing down every last possible cent of Brussels funding will, with the full co-operation of all parties, be maintained. There will be no loss of revenue from Europe whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">It is no secret that the current round of partnership talks have been difficult but we have had many difficulties since the instigation of the whole partnership process in 1987. I remind Members of that date, 1987, as this process has been in place for the past 16 years and has helped to contribute to a dynamic turnaround in the economic fortunes of this country and gains for all sectors. The partnership process has served this country well and partnership has served farmers particularly well. I applaud their contribution to the partnership process over the years  and their input into the series of previous agreements. I, like all my other colleagues in the Government, would like that input to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I have heard talk of pillars in this present process being removed and pushed out of partnership. This is not the case and I hope all the pillars can sign up to the newly negotiated agreement. There are difficult choices for the farming organisations and some aspects of the agreement may not suit them. Similar choices are faced by all the pillars, which, in a difficult budgetary climate, may have to accept that the resources previously available to them will have to be restricted. However, by signing up to this agreement their input into partnership is not restricted. Through mutual agreement with regard to priorities and resource allocation, this country can ride out the present externally unfavourable economic weather and restore Irish growth to its previously high levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Another aspect to the document on the table is also being overlooked. There is an overall issue that is more important than what is available for a particular industry, sector or group. The overall goal of the process is to continue the progress of Irish society as outlined in the NESC vision. This outlined a view of the continuation of Ireland's economic success and a nation that will be economically inclusive based on full employment and which will also continue a trend of consistent economic development, be socially inclusive and continue to adapt the country to change. It is appropriate to quote from the overall approach adopted in the proposed agreement to underpin national development:</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook, both domestically and internationally, and the reality of a fiscal environment in which current constraints have implications for prioritisation and timeframes for delivery across policy areas and programmes, have resulted in a different approach being taken in the development of this agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The achievement of the general overall measures within the new programme and within current resources is just as important as any sectoral measures. Of equal significance is the fact that measures that have been taken in this programme will, among other things, protect the general well-being of the economy which is, of course, of primary importance to farmers as it is to other sectors and will result in higher economic growth, lower interest rates and lower inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">In addition, the farming community has a vested interest in many of the ten special initiatives being undertaken during the period of the programme. These include the cost and availability of insurance – which is very important – tackling educational disadvantage, ending child poverty, care for people with disabilities and older people, and waste management. In the case of each initiative there is the need to put in place  appropriate arrangements involving all the pillars to develop these initiatives further. The successful implementation of these initiatives will make a major contribution to our quality of life. All major stakeholders in society must contribute to this process and it is for this reason that partnership involving all four pillars is so vitally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">There are very serious issues being raised in relation to the manner in which agriculture is supported in the context of the mid-term review proposals and the WTO negotiations. Those are challenges facing agriculture and the combination of those sets of negotiations could have a profound effect on the future shape of EU and Irish agriculture. It is vital to remain focused on these major drivers of change, while enlargement of the EU will also be an issue next year. In the mid-term review we have decoupling and modulation, both of which have to be tackled. We would bear a disproportionate cost compared to other member states because of our dependence on agriculture and any supposed increases in prices will be negated by the WTO, which may well support and dilute tariffs. There would be increased imports into member states, including Ireland, so there are no guarantees of an increase in prices as a result. I made this point strongly in the Council of Agriculture Ministers last week and my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, also took action in the Foreign Ministers' Council last week, which I shall describe later, to protect vital Irish interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">In relation to the WTO, the current round of negotiations is reaching a crucial stage. Last week the EU position on modalities under the new round was agreed at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Council. Political endorsement of the EU position on modalities was necessary in order to demonstrate to our WTO partners the determination with which we will engage in these negotiations. That endorsement was also necessary to strengthen the Commission's hand in the difficult negotiations it faces in Geneva.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">For these reasons, I insisted, together with my French colleague, that the Council should discuss the Commission paper. The discussion took place last week in the Foreign Affairs Council where Agriculture Ministers also discussed the EU position informally.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">In the Foreign Affairs Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs managed to secure a Commission declaration to the effect that specific tariff reductions under a new WTO round, which are a matter for internal EU decision, would be submitted to the Council for agreement. The Commission will remain vigilant with regard to the negotiations concerning products which are exposed to international pressure and, furthermore, will give special consideration to sensitive products.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Ireland must be extremely careful in this area. Though we are a relatively small country, we import a substantial amount of food products.  Last year, for example, we imported €1.8 billion worth of food products. Some 12% of the beef consumed in Ireland comes from outside the European Union as do a substantial part of our poultry and pig meat products. We need to ensure that Bord Bia's Feile Bia programme is observed and that Irish consumers at least inquire when they go to hotels and restaurants as to the origin of the food products they consume. There is no other way because Irish people import, distribute and consume these products. We must be vigilant with regard to these products because of the substantial imports and we want to reduce rather than accelerate the level of those imports.</p>

The Commissioner also assures me that, on a regular basis, inspectors from Brussels visit countries that export to the EU to test the products concerned at various plants to ensure they are free of harmful residues and are processed according to the standards we would insist on in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">Any country in which hormones are used is excluded from exporting to EU countries. We insist that no hormone produced products are admitted for sale to the EU. There is a section of the Commission, under the aegis of an individual commissioner, to ensure that continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">With regard to the WTO, I am now satisfied with the negotiating position the EU has taken on modalities. I would not underestimate the difficulty which the EU faces in the forthcoming negotiations, the outcome of which has the potential to create the conditions for further major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. I am not convinced of the need, for either internal or external reasons, for the EU to embark on any significant reform of the Common Agricultural Policy at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The point has been well made, including by Deputy Timmins, that farmers are entitled to security and a period when they can plan ahead, and they have been asked to do that by Dublin and Brussels. Agenda 2000 was negotiated and put in place in 2000 to last until the end of 2006 yet, in 2002, there were proposals for a major reform of the CAP. Those proposals were put on the table last week in Brussels and not only do they involve major reform, but they totally change the traditional way in which farming and the agricultural industry were supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">De-coupling is a classic example of a major change in the underlying support for farming in that traditional farming is expected to be discontinued, and a cheque is to be issued once a year  without any need for production. That would have an extremely detrimental effect on farming, farm supplies, co-op supplies and all the upstream and downstream parts of the industry, not to mention the damaging effect on our processing industry. That is why I vehemently opposed those proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I saw a poll in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> last week which suggested that a substantial number of Irish farmers were attracted to some of these proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">It could be attractive as a redundancy type payment to those who want to get out of farming for one reason or another, and it might suit those who have another job so that they do not have to tend livestock. However, that is short term. We have an important and worthwhile industry to support and it should be supported. With the Agenda 2000 regime in place up to 2006, this is no time for radical reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">From the point of view of the WTO, Agenda 2000 was designed specifically to prepare for the current round of negotiations and it can hardly be strategically prudent to embark on a further round of reform before we know the likely shape of the WTO round. The CAP was reformed in Europe in 2000 to prepare for the next round yet, before the next round has even begun, there is a further attempt at reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Last week in the Council, I strongly opposed the Commission's proposals on the mid-term review. I will continue to seek to preserve the benefits to the Irish agri-food sector which were negotiated under Agenda 2000 and to secure the best possible support for Irish agriculture and rural communities in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">It lacks credibility to suggest that the Government is anything other than fully committed to the agriculture sector. The focus on agriculture, given its importance to this country, is welcome. We seldom get a chance to discuss farming and agriculture in the House and, for that reason, this debate is welcome and that it has been so constructive is more important again.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">That is because we are facing a period in which there will be immense change. Agriculture, in both practical and policy terms, has become much more complex. The external environment within which it operates is subject to rapid change and the scale of change over the next few years will be greater than anything the sector has faced since we joined the European Community 30 years ago. The combination of CAP reform, the WTO and enlargement will mean that the sector will be operating in a completely different landscape in a few years. We cannot and should not close our eyes to these  changes. We should and must prepare to ensure that the sector can prosper in the years ahead. This is the real challenge which requires leadership, vision, optimism and confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Agriculture is central to economic and social life in this country. The Common Agricultural Policy has had a significant and positive impact on Irish farming. Apart from the support and market opportunities which it has provided, it has encapsulated the vision of agriculture which the Government, the farming sector and society in general share very strongly. This is centred on sustainable family farming, which protects the rural environment and provides safe food. This is the basis on which the sector merits such strong public support from the European taxpayer. Against a changing background we have a clear vision for agriculture. It is one where the sector remains our major indigenous industry, which is competitive and sustainable and which provides good, wholesome food from a clean environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Those involved in the industry must earn a decent living. I visited an agricultural college yesterday to give out certificates to farmers. Despite all the bad-mouthing of farming, more young men and women are attending agricultural colleges than ever before.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">I cannot claim to make any great political capital on behalf of my constituents in this debate because they are not worried by the  immediacy of agriculture. However, the spin off from what will happen in agriculture will be of great significance to them. Our only claim to the immediacy of agricultural production or profit in the area is that we have a thriving equine centre. They will be concerned about the quality and safety of our food and about job losses in the processing industry. All these issues will have a direct impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I want to refer to the recent farm protest at the beginning of January. That highlighted a number of issues of which we should remind ourselves in our debate this evening. Those issues have not gone away. Farmers do not have an average income of €45,000. Farm incomes were down by approximately 8.5% last year. The Book of Estimates and the budget were a combined slap in the face to farmers, particularly in light of the poor year they had in 2002. Doubling the disease levies has been a cause of major problems for farmers. Instead of doubling the disease levies, we should consider something to which the Minister alluded, namely, the eradication of such diseases. We should concentrate on ensuring we get rid of diseases, such as brucellosis and TB.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I am also concerned about the drop in the budget income for Teagasc. It is retrogressive and negative to take away a budget in the area in which we will need it most in the coming years, namely, the advisory services, research and training. I am concerned about the proposal during the week to consider closing Mellows College. It is the only college which undertakes significant organic farming, production and training. This is a niche market which should be examined, promoted and marketed aggressively rather than looking at it in a negative and retrogressive way and considering closing it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The differential between the price the farmer gets for the raw material and the price paid by the consumer is alarming. It seems the supermarkets gain most. Farmers get approximately 38% of the retail price. Some 62% of the value is mopped up somewhere along the way. Even allowing for the cost of slaughter, overheads, distribution etc., there is still a huge gap. The middle men are doing well, while the producer and consumer are badly hit. I raise this issue because the Minister should ask questions about this practice from the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Competition Authority. He should inquire where the piece in the middle goes and who benefits from it. He should find out why there is such a small take for the farmer and such a high payout by the consumer at the other end of the chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">There is no doubt that farm incomes and life in rural Ireland have changed significantly and will continue to change even more significantly in the future. The Minister and I are at one on that and we both agree there are challenges which must be addressed. It is important that farming is secured where it is strong and viable. There must be diversification of rural employment options and the rural population must be retained through resource-based development in other sectors,  such as forestry, marine and natural resources. If I am listening to Mr. Fischler correctly, he does not seem to be interested in forestry. He does not seem too concerned about developing that as an option.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Areas such as tourism in rural Ireland must be supported and enhanced. Rural towns must be supported with the labour supply and skills which will complement rural development. In that regard, there is a strong market for organic farming if it is properly developed and aggressively marketed. We pride ourselves on our image as a clean green country. We should capitalise on that as a niche market. I am not suggesting nor is it viable that the entire country turns organic. However, it is negative to consider closing Mellows College when there is a strong niche market for that type of farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Small farm holdings are becoming less viable. Increasing the size of holdings is the only reasonable and economic way to provide a viable future for farm families. However, small farmers should not be sacrificed to the larger enterprises. That is where I believe new ideas must come forward. Off farm work must be highlighted. We must link that with local infrastructure and we must see how that can be accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I mentioned research and development. We will depend more on good research and development programmes and on education programmes which the Minister mentioned. I was interested to hear him say that of the family of five, the farmer is doing best. He may be a protected species. I was surprised to hear that because most of us are aware that fewer young people are going into farming. The intake in the agricultural colleges is skewed because of the interests people are pursuing, such as in the equine area, rather than going into farming directly. We must be clear about what is happening in agricultural education. It is not fair to say that young farmers are the most lucrative compared to their brothers who take up alternative employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Deputy Enright mentioned bureaucracy and red tape. Farming has been strapped by bureaucracy and red tape, although some of it is necessary and essential. I would be the first to call for traceability and accountability. However, there is an enormous demand on the time of the farmer to complete the plethora of forms. Simple mistakes must be treated in a reasonable way rather than getting dug in and imposing fines and penalties. One of the positive things which may emerge from the Fischler proposals is that we might have less red tape and bureaucracy. However, I am afraid the current red tape might be replaced by a different type of tape. We might have alternative bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">There is a need for some adjustments, I agree with the Minister to some extent in that regard, but it is a matter of how these adjustments will be implemented without damaging the nature and quality of farming and farming life. Subsidies must remain an integral part of Irish farming. It would be impossible to implement environmental  policies or to sustain marginalised farms without subsidies. Transitional payments must be in place to safeguard the current generation of farmers, while allowing the transition to a new generation which must take on board the new styles and standards which are almost inevitable in farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Research, development and education cannot be sacrificed because that is the basis on which the change can occur with as little pain as possible and a positive outlook for future generations. It is up to the Government, particularly the Minister, to define how those changes will take place and to protect agriculture while that is happening. The scene must be set for gradual change which will give a new look to farming without damaging the quality of life or the acceptable level of income for farmers.</p>

        <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate tonight and I commend the Fine Gael Party for tabling the motion. I am not able to discuss it in great detail as I do not have enough time. Everybody has mentioned the recent tractor protest. If it did nothing else, it brought the issue of the decreasing income in farm families to the top of the public agenda – for the first time the public is behind the farming community – but, unfortunately, it did not bring it to the top of the political agenda. I was disappointed in the Minister's speech tonight. When the farmers took their tractors to Dublin in the first week of January, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Government press office and the Government backbenchers were wheeled out to list off the figures about investment in agriculture in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">However, the Minister missed the point. He repeated the same presentation tonight but both he and Government backbenchers failed to mention the Book of Estimates and cuts in Government expenditure. This relates to domestic politics. I will not deal with European issues as the negotiations in that regard are ongoing. I will list some of the cuts in the Book of Estimates. Under the heading of education, research and advisory services, there was a 24% cut in research and testing and a 13% cut in grant aid to Teagasc. Under livestock improvement, the budget for the cattle breeding authority was reduced by 11%. Grant aid for Bord Glas was cut back by 32% and by 13% for Bord Bia. The budget for REPS was cut by 19% while technical assistance for rural development was slashed by 85%. On-farm investment is down 58% for 2003. The budget for agricultural development under the national development plan was cut by nearly €25 million while the scheme of installation aid to young trained farmers has been savagely cut by 75%.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">What kind of commitment is that to agriculture? I have been meeting farmers recently, individually and at meetings where the absence of Government representatives told its own story. While farmers may be disappointed in the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Department, they are doubly disappointed in the Mini ster of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who voted for a Book of Estimates containing those cuts, having spent years lobbying Deputies on behalf of farmers. I recall meetings of farmers at which politicians were attacked by the Minister of State in his former role as a farm organisation leader, yet he voted for the Government cutbacks. Farmers will look with interest to how he will vote on this motion tomorrow night.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">It is difficult for Government representatives to understand what farmers are experiencing if they will not even meet them. They should meet the farmers, who are very decent people, and hear their concerns. Farmers are not interested in whatever investment took place in the past. Their concern is for their future, which looks very bleak. I have listed the cuts in the Book of Estimates. Farmers are also concerned about CAP reform and the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations. They are also worried about the national pay talks. I support the call by the IFA for intervention by the Taoiseach. Like a three legged stool, this process will fall without its fourth leg. I urge the Minister to persuade the Taoiseach to intervene. The farming community, which has been through good times and bad, should be properly looked after in the national pay talks. The issues which the farmers have raised are not huge.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The Government claims that times are bad and refers to economic difficulties. The situation need not be so bad if the Government was prepared to use the money available to it. The people will not be fooled again. They know what the Government is doing. Notwithstanding current Government statements on the difficult state of the economy over the next three or four years, there will be no shortage of money at that stage to buy the next general election as the last one was bought. The Government should put its money where its mouth is and look after the people of rural Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_722">Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús báire, buíochas a ghabháil le Teachtaí an Pháirtí Lucht Oibre as ucht a gcuid ama a roinnt liom anocht. I speak on behalf of my constituents as well as farmers generally. A number of my constituents participated in the recent tractorcade. They feel disillusioned because they have not been listened to and have not been getting what they would regard as fair results from the partnership talks. They are focusing very much on CAP reform, which gives an air of uncertainty as to the future of farming. On the basis of experience, the CAP has not worked in the manner which was advertised following its establishment back in 1957. The then six EEC member states had 22 million farmers. The present larger European Union now supports less than 7 million farmers and the trend is towards further loss of numbers from year to year.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">In that scenario, one might expect that the remaining farmers would have a higher income,  with more to share between fewer people. However, that is not the case. Income and living standards were down 20% in 2002, according to IFA figures. If we take the average industrial wage as a reasonable living income, average farm income is about half that level. I am not convinced of Government sincerity in its concern about farming. The evidence on the ground, according to IFA estimates, is that a further 15,000 farmers will be forced out of farming. That does not reflect well on the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">In relation to the reform of the CAP, there is clearly a major challenge ahead. The CAP has not been working and the reforms will have to involve far more than paying for the type of destruction schemes in relation to which the Minister mentioned a figure of €400 million. Money is being pumped into farming but the long-term effect has not been to guarantee a future for farmers. Of the organic food consumed in this country, 85% is imported. Why is the Government ignoring Bord Bia's forecast that production will rise by 30% per year over the next three years? The Irish market for organic produce is currently worth €20 million to €25 million per year and there is clearly huge potential. When my party published its organic food and farming targets Bill in 2000, we asked the Government to adopt a targeted approach. That has not been done. Denmark gives 100 times more support to organic growing than Ireland. I have spoken to conventional farmers who want to get into organic production and are afraid they will be left high and dry by a Government which does not take that conversion process seriously. The fiasco in relation to the closure of Mellowes College is a clarion call to farmers not to be tempted by organic farming under those circumstances. That is the message the Government is sending out. I ask the Minister to intervene to have Mellowes College kept open.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The forest service, when contacted by farmers, is unable to state what is the status of the native woodlands scheme or the neighbourhood scheme. The nursery sector of forestry has been losing business and farmers are losing faith in the forestry aspect of farming which had been heralded as an alternative farm venture. The Minister should take stock of this and address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">This country has followed a path of intensification in farming. This has suited the large multiples by allowing them to charge the profits which farmers do not receive on the basis of low farm prices. What we need is a greater level of extensification, having regard to the available land area. Land lying idle in arable setaside could be put to better use in, for example, free range poultry production. I urge the Minister to follow the extensification rather than the intensification route and choose localisation rather than globalisation. We need to be prepared for increased transport and production costs as part of the energy crisis which is around the corner if there is a war in Iraq. The situation must be addressed whereby the large multiples are taking an ever  increasing share of the food retail market. I propose that consultation take place with the various parties in this House and farming and consumer groups to build support for a successor to CAP which will reward farmers and protect the environment.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I wish to emphasise that the victims of abuse in State residential homes are fully entitled to compensation. That is not an issue in this debate, nor is there any question about delays in making settlements. There are two issues at stake here. One is the share out of liability between the State and the religious institutions. The other is the procedures used through 2002 in the negotiation and conclusion of this agreement. I want to know what role the Minister for Finance and his Department played in this process. What was the role of the then Attorney General who is now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</p>
          <p eId="para_728">One underlying principle we often hear from the Government is that the polluter must pay. In this instance the damage and abuse was caused by some members of religious institutions and their superiors who, like the Cardinal in the recent distressing Rundle case, allowed abusive situations to continue despite persistent warnings about what was going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I cannot accept that it could be right or proper to agree to a cap on the liability of those who carried out the abuse and those who permitted it to continue while at the same time to agree to the Exchequer meeting all costs above that cap. The Constitution places a particular onus on the Minister for Finance to protect the public interest when such unlimited demands are made. I cannot understand how the standard procedures such as a memorandum to Government or the usual restraining hand of the Department of Finance officials seemed to have been by passed in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">This is a flawed agreement. It is flawed in its content and in the way it was negotiated. It opens an appalling vista for the Exchequer that allows those individuals and institutions, who are the guilty parties in this unhappy saga, to escape the proper liability for their actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I want the Minister to answer a number of basic questions. What role did the Department of Finance play in the negotiations and was the Department kept fully up to date at all stages on the financial implications in order that the usual financial regulation and control was in place? From the end result it does not seem that the Department had any influence at all, as I cannot believe the Department of Finance would have surrendered the State to such a level of liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Who made the assessment of the likely number of claimants? Did the Department of Finance check this? Was there a proper memorandum to Government setting out the terms of a draft agreement before it was formally signed? What was the date of the Cabinet meeting at which this matter was discussed and did all Ministers and the then Attorney General have the opportunity to look it over? Was the Department of Finance asked to make detailed observations?</p>
          <p eId="para_733">What was role of the then Attorney General, Michael McDowell? Did he see the agreement and did he agree to its terms? As the law officer of the time, Deputy McDowell's responsibility was surely to oversee the level of Government liability and minimise the degree of risk to the Exchequer. Now his party, in a Sunday newspaper, is throwing up a figure of €2 billion as the true possible cost to the State. If this is what Deputy Harney and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, believe, they must surely explain to the House what role they had in the negotiation of the agreement which was sanctioned by them last June.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">On what basis was it decided to abandon any notion of shared equal liability and guarantee a perpetual cap on the religious liability? Why was the cash element of the deal so limited?</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Under section 16 of the agreement a review is possible to resolve a dispute between the parties to it. In view of the grave questions now arising in relation to this agreement, can the Minister say if he will avail of this mechanism to re-examine the deal?</p>
          <p eId="para_736">My party will be raising a series of further questions regarding how the State is handling this matter. I would also ask the Minister as a matter of urgency to check reports that the records of the Department of Education and Science regarding individuals have been given to an independent third party, not the redress board. They are with that party for processing in situations where individuals seek information held on State files. If that is true, I would be gravely disturbed.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_737">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and hope I will be able to throw some light on the matter and give some direct answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">The Department of Finance's involvement in the negotiations with the religious congregations was through participation in a group of officials chaired by the Department of Education and Science which also included officials from the Office of the Attorney General. The group held discussions with representatives of the religious congregations during the period February 2001 to October 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The background was that on 11 May 1999 the Taoiseach made an apology to the victims of childhood abuse and went on to outline a number of measures, including the setting up of a commission on childhood abuse. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 became law in April 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The commission published its first interim report in May 2001 in which, <i>inter alia,</i> it indicated that it did not intend to make public any determinations or findings until the inquiry has been completed. Hence, an accurate and complete picture of the nature and scope of child abuse in residential institutions will not be available until the commission publishes its full report.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">In February 2001, the Government approved the proposals for a compensation scheme. As Deputies will be aware, the Residential Institutions Redress Act which brought that scheme into effect was passed by the Oireachtas in April 2002. Section 7 of the Act provides for the payment of awards. It is important to point out that the Government decided on the residential institutions redress scheme as a major part of its general approach to try to bring some healing and closure to the victims of child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">As I already indicated, following consultation with their Ministers a group of officials from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's office met representatives of the religious congregations on a number of occasions during the period February 2001 to October 2001. The purpose on the official side was to explore whether the religious congregations would make a contribution towards the redress scheme and, if so, the amount of such contribution. In the course of these discussions the religious congregations raised the question of an indemnity as part of an agreement to contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Subsequent to the discussions at official level terminating in October 2001, I understand that the then Minister for Education and Science had further contact with the religious congregations as a result of which he informed Government on 30 January 2002 that he had reached an agreement in principle on the amount of a contribution and on an indemnity for the congregations concerned against all present and future claims arising from past child abuse which are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Bill 2001, as it was then.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Minister for Education and Science brought the matter to Government in the usual manner by way of a formal memorandum and the Government approved the agreement and the signing of the indemnity on 5 June 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">It was accepted that it was difficult to estimate the eventual cost of a redress scheme as it depended on the number of cases and the average award per case, both of which were uncertain. For purposes of estimation, a range of £200 million to £400 million was used – in terms of euro, that is a range of €250 million to €500 million. As Deputies will be aware, a matrix for awards was subsequently developed by an independent compensation advisory committee established by the Minister for Education and Science for the purpose of section 17 of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">However, it is important to understand that the final actual cost will not be known until the  redress board has completed its work which will be at least three years hence. This is because claims can still be made for three years from the operational date of the board, that is, 16 December 2002. It may be possible to make an informed estimate once a cross-section of cases have been dealt with by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Until such time as a pattern of awards by the board becomes available, based on a representative number of cases, it will not be possible to assess whether the cost range of €250 million to €500 million is a reasonable estimate. The final outcome may, or may not, fall within this range but it is not possible at this stage to provide a more reliable estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">As regards some of the more exaggerated figures in the media for the cost of the redress scheme, it may be instructive to point out—</p>

        <heading>Education Centre Network.</heading>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_754">This matter arose from a report that was commissioned by the Minister for Education and Science on education centres. The consultants who were employed, the CMOD, were asked to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of the existing education network which is providing courses and inservice training for teachers, both primary and post-primary. I was disturbed this morning when it was brought to my attention that one of the recommendations of that report was the closure of the part-time centre in Carlow and the full-time centre in Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">I was even more confused when I looked at the criteria used by the consultants. The consultants indicated that they would take account of geographical location, numbers of schools and teachers in the catchment area and the viability of the centres. They also said that although the centres were a resource for teachers, they would take into account the wider education community  in the future development of these centres, which would include the involvement of parents. These criteria would require some flexibility, they said, and in some cases geographical considerations might outweigh the viability criteria. On the one hand, therefore, the people who were asked by the Minister to compile this report were laying down certain recommendations about what would constitute viable education centres, but on the other hand they were saying they were not to be held to that because other factors could be taken into account, such as the involvement of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I am familiar with the Kilkenny Education Centre. In Carlow and Kilkenny there is a long tradition of inservice training of teachers at primary and post-primary level. Courses have been run on a voluntary basis over many years and all members of the teaching profession were delighted when the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, sanctioned the provision of a full-time education centre in Kilkenny. The education centre at Seville Lodge in Kilkenny acts as a full-time resource meeting place and support centre for the teachers and the wider school community at local level. The centre develops a range of professional and other support programmes to meet locally identified educational needs and co-ordinates and facilitates a range of national inservice programmes at primary and post-primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">It is run by a voluntary management committee of primary and post-primary teachers and is funded by the Department of Education and Science. It is located in a purpose-built centre which only opened five months ago. It has state-of-the-art IT and conference facilities and a staff of director, ICT adviser, administrator and part-time bookkeeping, secretarial and caretaking staff who co-ordinate the work of the centre. It serves the needs of more than 1,000 teachers in Kilkenny and surrounding regions. The part-time centre in Carlow serves as many teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">It is unthinkable that the part-time centre in Carlow and the full-time centre in Kilkenny, which opened just five months ago, would be closed as a result of this report. I do not believe that the Minister for Education and Science wishes to do this and I do not expect him to. However, I hope the Minister will clarify the position in the interests of the people who work there and use the centre and in the interests of educational development at primary and post-primary level in Kilkenny and Carlow.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_759">This matter is of considerable concern to Deputy Hogan and he has made an eloquent case on behalf of the centres in question. I assure the Deputy that decisions in regard to the retention of education centres in Kilkenny and Carlow and in relation to the development of the education centre network in general will be taken following full consideration of the relevant issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The role of the education centre network has expanded greatly since the first centres were set up in the late 1970s. The Education Act 1998 outlined their role as "providing services for schools, teachers, parents, boards and other relevant persons which support them in carrying out their functions in respect of the provision of education."  The centres, therefore, have become major players in the provision of in-career development in the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Due to the expanding nature and complexity of their role, the Department of Education and Science agreed with the Association of Teacher Education Centres Ireland, ATECI, the representative body for the education centre network, to commission a review of the education centres to clarify their role, functions and developmental potential as a strategic part of the education system nationally, regionally and locally. The Centre for Management Organisation and Development of the Department of Finance was commissioned to undertake the review. This review has been a detailed process involving wide-ranging research and consultation with the key stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The CMOD presented the report to the Minister for Education and Science recently and he decided to make it available to all interested parties. The Minister has agreed with the ATECI to set up a consultative process to commence as soon as possible. The report contains a wide range of recommendations in regard to all aspects of the operation of the network. One of the CMOD's terms of reference related to the issue of the geographical remit of the centres. In this regard, a recommendation in the report advocates the rationalisation of the education centre network. This involves the closure of three full-time centres, at Kildare, Kilkenny and Sligo, and closure of all part-time centres, including Carlow, but excluding the Gaeltacht part-time centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">All the recommendations in the report are being considered in the Department of Education and Science as part of a comprehensive review of delivery structures for in-career development generally. A thorough and comprehensive approach has been taken thus far and the Minister has agreed with ATECI that full consultation will take place with the education centres before any final decisions are made on the CMOD recommendations.</p>

        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_764">I had hoped that the Minister, Deputy Martin, would be present for this matter. I did not raise it to embarrass him or the IBTS or because I wanted heads to roll, but this issue is too important and worrying to ignore. When one hears, albeit some time after the event, that the new revamped and renamed IBTS had written to people whom it had previously infected with hepatitis C inviting them to donate blood, it makes one's hair stand on end. What does it take to bring home to people  in the IBTS, the Minister and all involved the enormity of what happened?</p>
          <p eId="para_765">It is almost 20 years ago since the chain of events was set in place. Despite all that has happened, deaths, ongoing debilitating illnesses, the enormous and incalculable impact it has had on the extended families, the ongoing enormous cost to the taxpayer and the burden on the health services, little has changed. One would have imagined that unassailable, cast iron safeguards would have been put in place to prevent even the remotest chance of infected persons donating blood, much less of them being invited to give blood by the very service that previously infected them. I cannot even begin to imagine the insult and hurt this must have caused to the people to whom the IBTS wrote.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">From a public health point of view the main concern is the continuous undermining of confidence in the blood collection, treatment and distribution service. It was always going to be difficult for the IBTS to recover from what had happened, starting in the 1980s and continuing up to very recently. It was always going to be difficult to recover from the scandal of distributing contaminated blood and re-establish any kind of confidence in the service and the integrity of its blood products. It will always live in the shadow of what happened. It would be absolutely unforgivable and create an irretrievable situation for the IBTS if there was to be another accident. It has not really dawned on it that it must be absolutely above reproach. That is what it has failed to grasp.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">It is not good enough for the IBTS to tell us that if people infected with hepatitis C had come to donate blood, it would have been detected later on. I am sure it would but 20 years on from the original scandals it leaves me almost speechless that it would be even talking about updating records at this stage. With its record, it has to be above reproach. What is most disturbing is that it does not seem to have grasped this.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">During the course of a previous discussion on the Lindsay report the Minister for Health and Children assured us, rightly, of big changes that had taken place in investment and in terms of a new culture of accountability. Where is the proof of this? Is the Minister monitoring the situation and ensuring these changes are taking place? If so, how can this happen again? The report of the Lindsay tribunal has been much criticised but its recommendations were the one solid thing to come out of the process. They rightly identified that this was not a case of individual culpability but a systems failure. There was a failure on the part of management to create clear lines of responsibility in reporting; a failure to provide for information systems, data and good record keeping, the ability to look back at what had happened and relate it to what was happening; and a failure of communications. These mistakes are still been made. Have the systems changed?</p>
          <p eId="para_769">It is not good enough for the Minister for Health and Children to offer us what now seems like a glib assurance – I do not think it was his intention to be glib – that everything has changed. It clearly has not changed. As far as the IBTS is concerned, nothing can be taken for granted. I just want the Minister for Health and Children to take a more personal interest in monitoring what is going on and ensuring the process of change is proceeding, rather than simply being reported as happening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_770">I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children. I presume the Deputy is referring to the articles in yesterday's newspapers relating to correspondence between the Department of Health and Children and the IBTS received by a journalist under the Freedom of Information Act, and thank him for raising the matter on the Adjournment because it is an understandable cause of public concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Department received a letter from Positive Action last year noting that one of its members who was hepatitis C positive had received a contact letter from the IBTS referring to donors who had been deferred because they had jaundice prior to their 13th birthday. On 3 January 2002 the IBTS introduced an additional test for hepatitis B, called the hepatitis B core antibody test, which detects hepatitis B at very low levels. This additional test allowed the IBTS to accept donations from donors who had jaundice before their 13th birthday and brought Ireland into line with practice throughout Europe and the United States. Up to this point, any donor who presented with a history of jaundice had been deferred from donating indefinitely. After the introduction of this test the IBTS decided to write to all those donors on its donor database who had been deferred because of a history of jaundice in childhood. This necessitated a mailshot to 8,000 donors.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Each donor was sent an explanatory letter outlining the rationale behind the introduction of the test. Attached to the letter was a questionnaire seeking additional information concerning the clinical details of his or her jaundice and his or her current state of health in order that this could be reviewed to decide if the particular donor was now eligible to donate. It should be stressed that the letter was in no way an invitation to donate, rather it was informing donors of the change to IBTS guidelines and the possibility that they could be reinstated onto the IBTS active donor panel. The letter stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_773">We have reviewed our records and note that you informed us that you had jaundice in the past. We would be most grateful if you would complete he enclosed questionnaire so that we can advise you if you are eligible to donate . . .  Please do not come to your local blood clinic with this questionnaire as you will not be able to donate until we have reviewed your questionnaire and amended your donor record if  appropriate. We will write to you and let you know if you are eligible to donate.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">As can be seen clearly from this excerpt, the letter to the donors was eliciting further information about the clinical details of their jaundice and current state of health. It was not an invitation to donate, nor could the donor donate on presentation of the letter or questionnaire at their local clinic. Therefore, as the letter was requesting further medical information, there was no danger to the blood supply as the recipients of the letter could not have donated without further medical assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Unfortunately, two donors who were hepatitis C positive received these letters. This had not been intended – the two donors had been included in the file of donors with a history of jaundice in addition to being on file as hepatitis C positive. The IBTS had not picked up this discrepancy when checking its file of 8,000 donors with a history of jaundice. It apologised for this error and any hurt this may have caused. When this error came to light it amended its coding system in order that in future donors who were hepatitis C positive would be deferred with a code used exclusively for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">In 2002 there was an 8.6% increase in donations over 2001. This resulted in an uninterrupted supply to hospitals for elective surgery, treatment of patients with cancer and so on. This change to the guidelines and other initiatives have enabled the IBTS to recruit donors who would previously have been ineligible to donate and facilitated it in responding to the emerging threat of CJD.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Following publication of the Finlay tribunal report in 1997, a multi-million pound investment programme was approved to support the reorganisation and redevelopment of the IBTS nationally. The primary objective was to ensure it was resourced to provide a transfusion service in line with best international standards. The report of the Lindsay tribunal, published in September last year, also made a number of recommendations in relation to blood, blood products and clotting factor concentrates. The Department is working in conjunction with the IBTS and other relevant agencies to ensure the recommendations of the Lindsay tribunal are implemented in full. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter on the Adjournment and agree with her that vigilance in this area is essential.</p>

        <heading>Infrastructural Projects.</heading>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I am grateful for the opportunity of highlighting my concern about the need for the Government to be proactive in encouraging necessary infrastructural development in the Cork city area in order that the city can properly live up to its potential and the great honour it has received in being named European City of Culture 2005. Serving as European City of Culture will obviously be a boon to tourism in the region and many will arrive at Cork Airport at  which Aer Rianta is holding up development through an inability to sign a contract with a contractor that would allow for the extension of terminal facilities and the replacement of very basic facilities such as air corridors that would allow passengers to walk from trains directly into the terminal and not, as at present, have to walk across the tarmac in all sorts of weather. Having exited the airport, people in cars, taxis or buses find themselves getting so far but no further as they come across the nightmare that is the Kinsale Road roundabout. The NRA has not included in its programme the necessary fly-over work to relieve traffic congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The bigger concerns, however, relate to the physical appearance of the city. In this regard I ask the Government to pay particular attention to two projects. One is the continuing poor condition of Cork city courthouse, a centrepiece building in the city which has been under hoarding for several years. The local authority has done all it can and it is now the responsibility of the Courts Service. Many millions of pounds have already been spent on it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that to finish the project will cost an additional €20 million. To leave a building in such a condition as the city is celebrating its naming as European City of Culture is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The other major infrastructural project, the development of Patrick Street as a street of excellence, is under way. It will not be completed because the properly designed street project incorporated both Patrick Street and the adjoining Grand Parade. A bit of imagination from the Departments concerned, the State agencies and local authorities will bring about the necessary improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The failure to make the final decision regarding the extension of the suburban rail network in the Cork area is disappointing. We do not know if there is to be Cork-Killarney or Cork-Midleton-Youghal services. These decisions should be made in light of Cork's tenure as European City of Culture in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Money will be provided for the programme. I am confident Cork will put on a good show. The programme of events will be well organised and interesting for locals and visitors alike. The year of culture will be a great experience for Cork, Munster and Ireland as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The infrastructure in the area of arts and culture needs to be improved. Question marks remain over the future of the Cork School of Music. The Government is dithering over whether the project should be a public private partnership or funded from another source. If the city is not allowed to express itself culturally and artistically through the font of ability that exists in its music, it will be an example of an inadequate response by Government that allowed the potential of the city of culture to be undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I hope the Government will admit there is a lot to be done but more to do. If Cork deserves  anything from the Government, it deserves a fast-tracking of projects that have been mentioned in the national development plan. Those of us who represent Cork city and county would be prepared to operate collectively and creatively to overcome whatever logjams exist. I appeal to the Minister of State to pass on this message to Cabinet members. We must establish how much funding is available so that the pieces of the jigsaw that will ensure Cork City of Culture 2005 is a success are put in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. For the benefit of the House I will outline the background to the issue raised by Deputy Boyle. Cork City Council's principal infrastructure project is its major refurbishment plan for the city's main streets, Patrick Street and Grand Parade. Phase one represents the bulk of the project and comprises all Patrick Street and part of Grand Parade as far as the junction with Washington Street. The project involves the reconstruction of the entire road and pedestrian areas in a plaza style from one building facade to another. The emphasis is to reduce the negative impact of traffic through-flow, allow far greater comfort for pedestrians and maximise the use of open space.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">This is an innovative project that was designed by the internationally renowned architects firm of Studio Beth Gali. The concept of the project represents a unique and exciting approach to city centre regeneration and is an appropriate venture for Cork as it takes on the mantle of city of culture. The Patrick Street project is well under way and has received €1.6 million direct funding from my Department under the urban and village renewal measure of the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme 2000-2006. The Deputy does not need to conduct a tour of the streets of Cork for me as I inspected the work in progress during a private visit to the city. Further allocations from this measure are due to be announced later this month. Cork city has com mitted €6.34 million of its own funds to the project. The city council stated that it was committed to significant co-funding of the scheme, within the wider budgetary constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">It is not just the Patrick Street area of Cork city that is set to benefit from funding under the urban and village renewal measure of the southern and eastern regional operational programme. The city council has indicated that it will spend its 2003 allocation under this measure on both the Patrick Street project and improvement works in the Shandon Street area. Cork City Council has benefited considerably from public funding in recent years. Patrick Street and Grand Parade have experienced significant reductions in city centre traffic volumes as a direct result of other road infrastructure already put in place – the Jack Lynch Tunnel, the south city link road, the south ring road, the construction of three bridges across the River Lee and the Blackpool bypass. In addition, €253,950 was provided by my Department for reinstatement works following completion of the main drainage works in Patrick Street and Grand Parade. The overall Cork main drainage scheme is nearing completion at the estimated cost of €280 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">My Department has allocated a further €6.034 million to the city council for work on non-national roads in 2003. This represents an increase of 16% on the outturn for 2002. Of this, €500,000 has been put aside for a special reinstatement programme of work for Cork city streets which will begin this year ahead of the city's special role as European City of Culture in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I take this opportunity to congratulate Cork City Council and the people of Cork for the work completed in regard to the preparations for European City of Culture in 2005. I confirm that funding will be made available under the urban and village renewal measure and the non-national roads allocation to assist in the continuation of works.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_794">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 413 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">From correspondence and routine liaison with Wicklow County Council, my Department is aware of the position regarding the council's ongoing investigations into unauthorised waste disposal activities. I have no direct function in relation to the enforcement of the Waste Management Act 1996. However, unauthorised dumping such as that which evidently has taken place is Wicklow is clearly a matter of concern and a number of measures have been or are being undertaken to support local authorities in combating such unacceptable activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">In the first instance, and at the request of my predecessor, the Garda Commissioner assigned a large full-time investigation team from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, NBCI, to investigate allegations of criminality in connection with unauthorised waste disposal activity. While its initial focus has been unauthorised activities in County Wicklow, the ongoing NBCI investigations are not limited to any geographical area.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_21">In the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, which was published last week, I propose various amendments to the 1996 Act that will facilitate more effective and direct enforcement of that legislation. In particular, they will enable more expeditious legal proceedings to secure the cess ation of unauthorised activity and-or appropriate environmental remediation. I propose shortly to allocate resources from the environment fund directly to local authorities to enable them to improve their overall environmental enforcement efforts, with particular regard to unauthorised waste activity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_22">As regards the "polluter pays" principle, any person or concern that is responsible for unauthorised waste activity that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution should be liable for the costs of investigations by relevant public authorities and of any environmental remediation required to be carried out. The 1996 Act provides a number of mechanisms to this end, including power under sections 57 and 58 to seek appropriate court orders. Wicklow County Council has already successfully utilised these powers in the first of the legal proceedings that it intends to undertake regarding unauthorised dumping in the county.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">I am not aware of any suggestion that Wicklow County Council considers it is hampered in its ongoing investigations by constraints on financial resources. I am satisfied that the deployment of the various measures which I have mentioned, in addition to the resources already available to local authorities, is equipping local authorities appropriately in relation to their environmental enforcement functions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_798">The National Development Plan 2000-06 provides for a total investment of over €7.7 billion for programmes in the areas of non-national roads, water and wastewater and waste management. The total allocation for non-national roads in the NDP is just under €2.5 billion. I am happy to report that good progress continues to be made under this measure, which provides for the development, upgrading, maintenance and restoration of regional and local roads. This was confirmed by the evaluation of investment in the road network, an independent study carried out by economic consultants Fitzpatrick Associates, published in August 2002, and available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_24">Last week I announced that I was providing €433.986 million for non-national roads in 2003. To put this in context, this year's provision is double the 1997 provision and represents €4,346 for every kilometre of non-national roads in every county in Ireland. The NDP provides for investment amounting to almost €4.4 billion on water  and sewerage schemes. Over the first three years of the NDP, €1.525 billion was spent on these schemes. This amount was slightly ahead of the projected expenditure of €1.485 billion and resulted in 208 schemes being completed by mid-2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">The water services investment programme for the years 2002-04 contains over 600 individual water and sewerage schemes, including 129 new schemes. Some €164 million was spent on the rural water programme in the three years to the end of 2002, with increased expenditure planned for 2003 and beyond. The investment target for the provision of waste infrastructure under the national development plan is €825 million, with the funding to be provided principally by private finance through public private partnerships. Progress has been slow to date on major infrastructure elements of the waste management programme, but this is expected to improve as key projects are advanced under the regional waste management plans.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">There has been good progress in relation to local recycling and recovery initiatives. In November 2002 I announced the first round of grant allocations totalling €14.3 million in respect of waste recycling facilities. This initial round, which was for local authorities and was focused on projects that were under way or capable of early delivery, will be followed by a further round of allocations to private waste concerns, once clearance has been obtained from the European Commission under EU state aid rules. I hope to be in a position to announce further tranches of allocations in the coming months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">The Government is committed to providing the investment needed to carry out the improvements in public infrastructure envisaged under the NDP and which are necessary to sustain Ireland's competitiveness and future growth prospects. The Government's objectives in this regard are being maintained and we will continue to prioritise investment in capital infrastructure over the remaining years of the NDP.</summary>

          <p eId="para_801">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 141 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Ballycroy National Park, County Mayo, was designated as such with effect from 1 November 1998. It comprises 11,800 hectares of some of the most important blanket bog in Europe, which is located in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area of north-west Mayo. The national park has the status of a category 2 national park under the guidelines of the IUCN, which is the World Conservation Union and is affiliated to the United Nations. The IUCN is the international authority which sets the criteria for the protected areas of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Ballycroy National Park is already accessible to the visitor along the Bangor trail, south of Bangor Erris, as well as from Srahmore – points which are to the north and south of the national park, respectively. Due to the sensitive nature of the landscape of the national park and its designation as a special area of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, 1992, my Department has developed a proposal to construct a visitor centre in the village of Ballycroy which, it is intended, will interpret the park and will attract a larger number of visitors to the general area. A provision of €3.8 million was indicated under the National Development Plan 2000-06 to finance this project. I am pleased to inform the House that an attractive and extensive site, comprising 42.33 hectares, 125 acres, and with significant road frontage has already been purchased by my Department for the proposed visitor centre in the village of Ballycroy. Expenditure on design fees for the project and land acquisition totals €406,709 to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The visitor centre project is being developed by my Department in consultation with representatives of the various local community organisations in Ballycroy, as well as with the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council, and plans for the proposed scheme are at an advanced stage. It is the intention that these plans would be complemented by sewage treatment works for the village of Ballycroy, as well as access roads and bus and car parking on the purchased site for the visitor centre itself, to be undertaken by Mayo County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I am currently undertaking a review of my Department's capital heritage programme under the national development plan with a view to prioritising and rescheduling relevant projects. Implementation of the Ballycroy National Park Visitor Centre and other planned projects will be addressed in this context.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_28">Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with local sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the EPA. The agency publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water  in Ireland, and a copy of the report for 2001 is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report is based on the results of some 146,000 individual tests on over 22,000 samples of drinking water taken from 2,440 supplies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">The EPA 2001 report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water with an overall compliance rate of 94.3% with prescribed standards for all supplies, based on 14 principal parameters. It also indicates improvements in the compliance rate for the important parameter faecal coliforms which, in public supplies, was up from 96.7% to 97.2% and, in group schemes, was up from 70.8% to 74.1%. Following on from recommendations made in previous years, documented procedures are in place or in preparation by a number of authorities to respond to detected breaches of quality standards. Future reports will highlight the extent to which deficiencies identified in EPA audits have been addressed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">Ongoing investment by my Department in the development and upgrading of water supply infrastructure is intended to maximise compliance with prescribed quality standards. The National Development Plan 2000-06 provides for investment amounting to some €1.3 billion on major water supply schemes, and the water services investment programme 2002-04 includes 218 public water supply schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">Water quality deficiencies in group water schemes are mainly confined to those schemes which are dependent on private sources, including rivers, lakes and boreholes. The schemes involved serve some 50,000 rural households. Since March 2000, all of these schemes are eligible for a 100% grant for the installation of water disinfection and treatment equipment. To ensure the most cost effective delivery and operation of such equipment, and secure the long-term protection of the related capital investment, procurement policy in the group sector is, in common with small public schemes, based on design, build, operate contracts, coupled with the grouping of numbers of schemes under a single contract. My Department recently produced a comprehensive procurement guidance document to assist local authorities and group schemes in the implementation of this policy. The EPA report acknowledges and welcomes the extensive Government response to problems in this sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_32">Local authorities recently submitted applications for funding in respect of upgrading proposals for 375 individual group schemes which supply an estimated 33,000 rural households. I will shortly announce details of record capital allocations under the rural water programme, which will ensure that all these proposals are fully implemented. The new EU Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EC has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2000. These come into operation on 1 January 2004 and will revoke and replace the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations 1988 with effect from that date. The regu lations will introduce strict time limits for compliance and provide for offences and penalties in the case of non-compliant private suppliers of drinking water. It is also intended to introduce a licensing system for the group water sector under the forthcoming water services Bill.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">A comprehensive group water scheme monitoring programme commenced in October 2002. Under this programme drinking water in the estimated 1500 group schemes coming within remit of the new drinking water regulations will be sampled and analysed. I have also recently appointed consultants to assist in the establishment of a drinking water national monitoring programme. This will put in place a comprehensive, harmonised and uniform system of sampling, testing and reporting to assist compliance with the new regulations.</summary>

          <p eId="para_823">Security and integrity have been paramount in the design, testing and implementation of the electronic voting and counting system. Original tender submissions were assessed and the successful solution selected on the basis of, <i>inter alia,</i> functionality and product quality including hardware and software security and application of the count rules as in the case of a paper ballot. Detailed functional specifications, likewise, made extensive reference to security aspects of the system. The testing programme has been thorough and involved independent examination of the voting machine and voting machine software by a number of recognised international test institutes and private companies. The voting machine hardware and software has been tested by PTB, the National Institute for Science and Technology in Germany. Separate reports have been prepared by two test institutes in the Netherlands: TNO subjected the voting machine to a range of environmental tests and KEMA Quality BV tested the machine for compliance with international safety standards.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_34">An Irish company, PMI Software Limited carried out an architectural and code review of the system software. My Department also engaged the Electoral Reform Society in the UK, which has extensive experience of STV election counts, to test the software against its database of over 300 elections. The count software was, in  addition, tested for functionality and accuracy both by my Department and a number of Dáil returning officers. Finally, in relation to vote counting, the system can produce, after the votes are mixed, vote tables to enable progress of the count to be monitored and also to trace a vote at any stage of the count. If necessary, following a High Court order in an election petition case, the system can also produce a ballot paper, with preferences, to allow a manual count to be carried out. At the general election and referendum pilots in 2002, the software was used under licence from the supplier and at present, the source code is not available to the public. The software is currently being modified for use at the European and local elections in June 2004 and when this work has been completed and tested, I will give careful consideration to the making of the source code available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">The Zerflow report, which was the subject of recent media reporting, was commissioned by my Department as an addition to the principal reports to which I have referred. The company was requested to carry out a security assessment of the procedures to be applied in the use of voting machines in polling stations to ensure that procedures proposed by the Department were adequate. The issues raised by the Zerflow report, which dealt mainly with possible threats to the external physical features of the voting machine, were assessed by my Department and by Nedap-Powervote – the machine manufacturers. The assessment by both was that the main scenario identified was implausible and that the likelihood of its occurrence without detection was extremely remote.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">I should emphasise that the version of the voting machine used in this country has more security features than the versions used in the Netherlands and Germany where the issues raised by Zerflow have not been identified in any risk assessments. In addition, the integrity of the Irish voting process is protected on polling day by a set of protocols operated by polling staff and the Garda under the supervision of the returning officer. My Department will continue to keep these arrangements under review and will update advice provided to returning officers, as necessary, including advice in relation to the presence of audio, video or photographic recording devices which are not permitted in polling buildings. I also intend that further expert consideration will be given to external security issues in prospect of the use of electronic voting machines in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">In addition to the design and testing undertaken, the actual use of electronic voting and counting at real polls has provided a crucial assessment of the security and integrity of the system. Following its use in three constituencies at the May 2002 general election and at the Nice referendum last October, the reaction of election staff and the public was overwhelmingly positive. In October 2002, the Government approved the use of the system throughout the country at the European and local elections in 2004 and work  on this project is ongoing. The estimated cost of the voting system equipment for a countrywide rollout is €36 million plus VAT. Most of this expenditure will be recouped in the form of reduced election expenditure over the life of the voting machines. While all aspects of the system will be kept under ongoing review, I am satisfied that our electronic voting and counting system meets the key criteria of any electoral system in terms of ease of use, maintaining the secrecy of the ballot, accurately recording and counting votes and security.</summary>

          <p eId="para_825">While the various electoral Acts are under continuous review, I intend to put in train a specific review of the operation of Parts 4 and 5 of the Electoral Act 1997. Since its enactment, the 1997 Act has been amended on a number of occasions. In addition, the Acts provisions have now been used at all elections covered by the Act, including the general election in May 2002. It is therefore opportune to review its provisions following experience gained at the various elections. I have also asked the Standards in Public Office Commission for a report on the commission's views on the operation of the Acts provisions at the general election. I expect the review to be completed in the second half of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">The Government has been responding actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding on our social and affordable housing output. Last year we delivered the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for 15 years. We will continue to maintain the high levels of overall social and affordable housing output in 2003, where capital funding for housing, Exchequer and Non-Exchequer, at €1.7 billion, is up 7% on the amount provided in 2002. The provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 are designed to make the Part V system operate more efficiently and effectively, to elim inate the rigidities that were slowing down supply, to bring more social and affordable housing on stream more quickly, while continuing to promote social integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">In addition, amendments to housing legislation contained in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 enable approved bodies in the voluntary and co-operative sector to undertake affordable housing and to grant shared ownership leases on houses they provide, including houses provided pursuant to agreements entered into under Part V. These amendments will enable the sector to provide a mix of tenure types and will contribute to the objective of avoiding undue social segregation in their projects. I anticipate that the new legislation will contribute to the increase in the overall supply in the housing market and, in particular, to ensuring a continued good supply of social and affordable housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">The national hazardous waste management plan, NHWMP, relates to the period 2001-06. It makes recommendations in respect of four main areas: implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of "unreported" hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure to attain national self-sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; and identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_38">Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to, recommendations contained in it. The plan recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate its overall implementation. In the policy statement "Preventing and Recycling Waste – Delivering Change" published last year, a range of organisational and policy initiatives were outlined in support of more effective waste management. These include the establishment of a core prevention team within the EPA to implement a major national waste prevention programme that will encompass both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, focus on the elimination of waste from manufacturing, and  improvements in the environmental performance of products. This initiative will be advanced as rapidly as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I am also establishing a separate committee to oversee the implementation of the non-prevention aspects of the NHWMP. My Department has invited a range of business, agricultural and environmental organisations, as well as relevant Government Departments and State agencies, to nominate representatives to participate on this committee. Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40">With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the "polluter pays" principle, grant assistance is available under the national development plan to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes. The NHWMP outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the EPA and applied as a pilot project undertaken by Laois County Council. Following the completion of this project towards the end of last year, the EPA is expected during 2003 to develop and publish more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_41">As I indicated in the reply to Priority Question No. 111 on today's Order Paper, significant additional funding has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund over recent years. I am confident that the level of 2003  general purpose allocations from the fund, which on average represent increases of some 6.4% on 2002 allocations, together with increases in income from local sources, will be appropriate to meet the reasonable cost of local authority services this year. Looking to the medium term, I consider that a review of local authority funding is now timely. Much has changed in terms of the national economic situation, national taxation trends and the scale and nature of demands on local authorities since the last major review of local government funding was carried out.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_42">I will shortly be inviting proposals from independent bodies to carry out an in-depth and broad ranging review which will assess the existing funding system and potential alternative systems. When this review is completed and I have had the opportunity to examine its results, I will be in a position to take decisions on the most appropriate arrangements for funding local government into the future. While the terms of reference of the review will leave this open to all viable options for improving the financing base of local government and will not directly exclude particular options, I have no reason to believe that a poll tax will commend itself in this context.</summary>

          <p eId="para_836">Since 1 January 2002, Regulation EC 2037/2000 has required the recovery and destruction of ozone depleting substances contained in domestic refrigerators and freezers. In addition, European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC revised the EU list of hazardous waste to include, with effect from the same date, equipment which contains CFCs. These changes affect the disposal of fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994, which contain CFCs in insulating foam as well as in fridge coolant. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants, no equipment is yet available for the removal of the insulating foam. Accordingly since 1 January 2002 fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal for recycling and sending the remaining waste to landfill.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_43">However, in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland, a problem also being experienced in other EU member states, a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers or for their export to appropriate European recovery facilities. Such  arrangements may involve co-operation with private waste companies. In the interests of a longer term solution and within the co-operative framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, my Department has developed an all-island approach to this issue in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. Tenders were sought in September 2002 on behalf of all local authorities on the island for the provision of a service for the management of waste fridges and freezers. Closing date for receipt of tenders was 4 November 2002. Consultation of these tenders by a North-South evaluation group is now at an advanced stage, and is expected to conclude shortly.</summary>

In regard to Sellafield, the meeting had before it a revised draft discussion paper on Sellafield and radioactive waste jointly prepared and submitted by Ireland and the Isle of Man. Consideration of this paper by the group was deferred at the request of the UK because of Ireland's current legal actions relating to the Sellafield MOX plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The group agreed that Sellafield and radioactive waste would remain on the agenda and be among the main issues for discussion at the next meeting and that the UK would produce two papers, for that meeting, on the vitrification of high level liquid waste stored at Sellafield and on the safety issues relating to the long-term storage of plutonium at Sellafield. Ireland and the Isle of Man undertook to update the joint paper on Sellafield and Radioactive Waste for consideration at the appropriate time in the group.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">The Government's strategy to increase housing supply has delivered record levels of overall housing output in successive years, enabling us to meet demand and improve affordability, particularly for first-time purchasers. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective. Total new house completions in 2001 was over 52,600 units, an increase of 5.6% on 2000 and the seventh consecutive year of record housing output. Provisional data for 2002 shows that new house completions will be around 57,200 units, an increase of 8.8% on 2001 – clear evidence that Government policy is having effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Our approach has included the major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. The provision of social and affordable housing has grown by from about 8,700 units in 2000 to a forecast of about 12,000 units for this year. The voluntary housing sector is playing an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing with output likely to reach an all-time record level of close to 1,400 units last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. It is clear that, apart from these schemes, the house building industry is also responding to the need for more affordable housing, with an increased supply of more affordable homes coming on stream, particularly in the greater Dublin area during last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The Government remains committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases.</p>

Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, as part of the joint fulfilment of the EU reduction target of 8%, is to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to an increase of 13% above our 1990 baseline by the period 2008-12.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_45">Ireland, together with all other member states and the EU, ratified the protocol on 31 May 2002. In parallel with ratification, the first progress report on implementation of the strategy was published. This confirms that a good start has been made, with action under way to deliver 20% of the required reductions. However, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be interrupted, and I have initiated a review to assess existing and potential new measures to achieve our target. The review is being undertaken by the cross-departmental climate change team, established to oversee implementation of the strategy and chaired by my Department, in consultation with Comhar – the national sustainable development partnership. It will update and strengthen the strategy by ensuring all necessary policies are put into place, and their implementation is pursued vigorously across all sectors. I hope to have the review finalised during the first half of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-12 period.</summary>

          <p eId="para_854">The conservation grant scheme for protected structures was introduced in 1999. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of €13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or €25,000 whichever is the lesser. Accordingly, the scheme is not intended to meet the full cost, but is designed to assist owners or occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Local authorities administer this scheme and each local authority is allocated a fixed amount of funding for grant purposes in each calendar year.

In 2000, the Government decided to establish a national public property register, under the aegis of the Department of Finance. The objective of this register is to assemble information on lands and buildings in the ownership of Departments and State agencies, including non-commercial State bodies, health boards, local authorities and certain education bodies in order to identify under utilised land and to provide a basis for the consideration of the appropriate use of these resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Land which is suitable for housing could either be sold to local authorities for social and affordable housing or sold for private housing with the revenues used to support other State services. In the latter case, the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2002 in relation to social and affordable housing would apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">My Department has encouraged local authorities to acquire land in order to address increasing housing need. Local authorities have borrowed some €430 million since 1999 for land acquisition for housing, including land acquired from public agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">My Department is aware that the Irish Building Control Institute, IBCI, has expressed a number of concerns about the operation of the building regulations. The relevant framework legislation, the Building Control Act 1990, assigns responsibility for complying with the building regulations primarily to the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. The role of local building control authorities is, within this framework, included as one of monitoring buildings for compliance with the building regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">My Department and the City and County Managers Association have adopted a target of inspecting a representative sample of buildings, currently equivalent to at least 12% to 15% of developments in the functional area of each building control authority. Within that overall target, priority is given to building works that are the subject of any complaints and buildings used by large numbers of people, such as buildings of public resort, including offices, hotels and cinemas; multi-storey buildings, including apartment blocks; institutional buildings, including hospitals and nursing homes. Local authorities also issue fire safety certificates for new non-residential buildings and new apartment blocks certifying that, if the relevant buildings are constructed in accordance with the plans lodged with the authority, they will comply with part B, fire safety, of the building regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">My Department has consistently encouraged local authorities to actively enforce parts A to M of the building regulations. The appointment of building control officers has been sanctioned. FÁS, in partnership with Offaly County Council, has developed customised training courses and computer software for building control officers. Building control fees have been substantially increased to make adequate funds available for local enforcement. At present, more than 90% of authorities are carrying out inspections, more than 80% of authorities have achieved the target level of inspection and the remaining authorities have been requested to achieve the agreed target as soon as possible.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_53">The third case concerns the dangerous substances directive (76/464/EEC). Ireland lodged its defence by the due date, 29 November 2002. This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 and related legislation. For the purposes of the directive, water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances including certain pesticides, solvents and metals. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to Irish water quality is eutrophication due to excess nutrient inputs and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem. It is envisaged that the directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the water framework directive (60/2000/EEC). The European Commission's response to Ireland's defence is awaited.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">The fourth case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that relevant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act 1996 and subordinate regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills is virtually completed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">The fifth case relates to the volatile organic compounds directive (1999/13/EC).

In pursuing the objective of more balanced regional development the strategy will – in conjunction with regional planning guidelines which will give effect to the strategy at regional level and more detailed local authority development plans – seek to integrate planning for where people live and work more closely with policies for spatially balanced provision of, and access to, key social infrastructure, such as educational and healthcare provision.</p>

Oral hearings in relation to this case took place before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in October 2002 and a determination in the case is expected later this spring.

          <p eId="para_912">My Department is aware of the recent British media reports on the exercise referred to. The adequacy of emergency measures designed to protect the British public in the aftermath of an accident or incident at a British nuclear facility is a matter for the British authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Regarding the potential threat to Ireland from any possible attack on Sellafield, this has been raised with the UK authorities and I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 23 and 183 of 28 November 2002. In the event of any accident or incident at the Sellafield plant, the critical issue for Ireland is early notification. There are two early notification systems which are used for early warning of the occurrence of a nuclear accident abroad. Following Chernobyl, countries with nuclear power plants entered into an agreement, called the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, under which any country which operates nuclear installations is obliged to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately of an accident, in any of the country's installations, which could have an effect outside the country's own boundaries. The IAEA, through its emergency response unit based at its headquarters in Vienna, will immediately pass on to all its member states, including Ireland, any notification which it receives of a nuclear accident in any part of the world. In addition to this IAEA system, there is a separate system, known as ECURIE – European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange – rated within the European Union. Under this, each EU member state is required to notify other member states of any radiological accident that could have consequences outside its territory. They must also provide details of any protective actions being taken and results of radiological measurements carried out.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_61">The Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is regularly updated. My Department has the lead role in implementing the plan through the emergency response co-ordination committee. This committee which also includes representatives of other Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity. An information booklet entitled National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies was published by my Department in March last year. The booklet sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet has been distributed to every household in the country. A Government  task force on emergency planning is also in place to harness the work of Departments and agencies with key roles in emergency planning and to improve co-ordination among them.</summary>

          <p eId="para_969">The Government published the national spatial strategy on 28 November 2002. Since then I have organised and attended a series of roadshows in every region of the country to spread the message of the NSS and start the process of teasing out how it will unfold in each region. Representatives of a wide cross-section of interests attended the roadshows, including the local media, regional and local authorities, official and semi-official bodies and agencies, businesses and commercial interests, academic institutions, local organisations and societies. The purpose of the roadshows was to set out the purpose and objectives of the strategy, with a view to encouraging the active participation of all relevant bodies and interests in its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">In leading the implementation of the strategy it is my intention to establish and support the necessary interaction, monitoring and other mechanisms to achieve consistency between the NSS and the spatial aspects of all relevant public policies and programmes. Structures and mechanisms are therefore being put in place to integrate the strategy into planning and activities at Government, departmental, state agency, regional and local level. This will ensure that the strategy informs the spatial aspects of public sector planning, policies and programmes and assists in the determination of investment priorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_62">One of the main priorities in the early stages of rolling out the national spatial strategy is to get work started immediately on the preparation and adoption of regional planning guidelines under the Planning and Development Act 2000 to give effect to and support the implementation of strategy at regional level. These guidelines will be drawn up within the national planning framework set out in the NSS while providing more detailed strategic guidance at regional level, which will in turn guide planning authorities in framing their county and city development plans. The purpose of this is to ensure that spatial policies at national, regional and local levels are consistent. My  Department will shortly issue detailed guidance to assist regional authorities, working in partnership with local authorities and other relevant interests, in the major task of preparing and adopting regional planning guidelines by the early part of next year.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_63">The nitrates directive has been substantially implemented in Ireland by way of extensive monitoring of nitrate levels in waters, the assessment of the trophic status of waters, the development and dissemination in 1996 of a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates and a range of other measures which operate to protect water quality from pollution by agricultural sources. These other measures include the provision of funding under schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, DAF, such as the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the rural environment protection scheme, and the farm waste management scheme to support expenditure by farmers on measures for pollution control and environmental protection. They also include by-laws made by local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, a wide range of implementation and enforcement actions taken by local authorities under those Acts, the progressive extension of the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the EPA to apply to a wider range of intensive agricultural activities, and the introduction of requirements for compliance with good farming practice in the  context of agri-assistance schemes administered by DAF.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Extensive discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests have taken place since December 2001 and are continuing, as to the further implementation of the nitrates directive. In February 2002, my Department issued an information paper on good agricultural practice and protection of the environment which set out the background issues and the preferred approach of applying an action programme to all areas rather than to designated vulnerable zones. The paper was prepared in consultation with, and reflects the views of, DAF and Teagasc. A copy of the paper is in the Oireachtas Library.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">The Government has indicated its position on further implementation of the nitrates directive in the context of recent discussions with the farming pillar for the development of a new partnership agreement. This will involve an action programme, including regulations, which will be applied in relation to the whole country and will provide statutory support for the application of established standards of good agricultural practice. This approach is the best option in the interests of environmental protection, equitable treatment between farmers and greater certainty for farmers to facilitate planning and investment decisions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">The action programme will include limits on the amount of organic nitrogen that may be applied to land. A general limit of 210 kg N per hectare will operate for the first four years as allowed by the directive. The Government will utilise the derogation provisions of the directive to seek approval of a derogation for nitrogen limits of up to 250 kg N per hectare per annum, by reference to evidence-based discussion with the European Commission regarding the impact of nitrates on water quality under Irish farming conditions. Suitable research programmes will be put in place, led by Teagasc, to enable Ireland to retain appropriate derogations. The directive allows for derogations which do not compromise its objectives and can be justified by reference to objective criteria such as long growing seasons, crops with high nitrogen uptake, or high net precipitation. In the absence of agreed derogations, the directive requires that a standard general limit of 170 kg N per hectare be applied.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">Suitable monitoring programmes will be developed to assess the effectiveness of the action programme as to improvements in water quality and farm management, for example, provision of waste storage capacity, use of fertilisers, nutrient management planning. The detailed provisions of the action programme and related research and monitoring programmes will be finalised over the coming months in consultation with the main farming organisations and other interests, with a view to completion by end June 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">The most recent comprehensive data published on the quality of drinking water are contained in the EPA report on the quality of drinking water  in Ireland for the year 2001. This report, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, indicates a compliance rate of 99.1% in drinking water supplies, public and private, in relation to the prescribed standards for nitrates.</summary>

          <p eId="para_981">My Department has been concerned to provide an adequate legislative and financial framework in place within which local authorities, voluntary bodies and Travellers may provide or be assisted in the provision of accommodation for Travellers. The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides  the legislative framework within which the accommodation needs of Travellers is provided. Under that Act each county and city council, borough council and the town councils of Bray and Dundalk are required to prepare and adopt five-year Traveller accommodation programmes and to take all reasonable steps to implement their programmes. All relevant local authorities adopted programmes, covering the period 2000 to 2004, and are in the process of implementing these programmes.</p>

This expenditure is in addition to the expenditure on standard local authority accommodation funded under my Department's local authority housing programme and housing provided by voluntary housing bodies and funded under my Department's voluntary housing schemes which was allocated to Travellers in this period. My Department continues to liaise closely with local authorities in relation to the implementation of their programmes.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_995">I welcomed the recent publication of the report prepared for the EPA concerning releases of dioxins and furans to the Irish environment in 2000, and projections for 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The issue of dioxins has been controversial in recent years, arising from concerns regarding the extent and environmental impact of dioxin emissions from proposed thermal treatment facilities for animal and municipal wastes. These concerns are attributable in part to misinformation and misunderstandings on this matter. Accordingly, I consider this report a very useful, objective, contribution to our information base on dioxins in the environment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_71">Overall, the report indicates that Ireland generates relatively low amounts of dioxin – an estimated 93 grams was generated in 2000 – and in this regard it supports the findings of earlier EPA surveys of dioxin levels in Irish cows' milk, which showed an overall 16% reduction in the period 1995 to 2000, to levels that are uniformly low by international standards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">The inventory was compiled using measured dioxin emission data where available, but otherwise a standardised methodology recently developed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was utilised, using emission data from other countries. The report cautions that there is a degree of uncertainty associated with the results; while the relative importance of individual emission sources can be identified by the study, actual emissions estimates for each source must be carefully interpreted.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">Clearly, more research and investigation is necessary to generate emission data specific to Ireland. However, the report is useful in identifying the relative significance of various emission sources for dioxins. Most notably, it is evident that the biggest source of emissions to both air and land is, and is expected to remain, uncontrolled combustion processes, in particular, the home burning of domestic waste, house and vehicle fires, and Halloween bonfires.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">Contrary to assertions that proposed thermal treatment facilities for waste will greatly increase dioxin emissions, the report indicates that in 2000, existing hazardous waste incinerators contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air. Even taking into account a projected incineration of 1 million tonnes per annum of municipal waste by 2010, the report estimates that waste incineration would contribute less than 2% of national dioxin emissions to air. Overall, the report anticipates that, even with significant waste incineration, annual dioxin emissions to air from all sources will fall by over 10% by 2010. This trend is obviously welcome.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">Controlled sources of dioxin emissions are necessary to deliver progressive improvements in emission performance. Clearly, uncontrolled combustion processes are the main concern, if national dioxin emissions to air are to be further reduced. In particular, the burning of waste by households is a problem to be addressed, and I will be highlighting this as part of national environmental awareness reviewing activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">I am studying the findings of this report carefully, and intend to bring forward appropriate measures both to support an improved information database on dioxins in the Irish environment and to pursue a progressive reduction in emissions, where those are achievable in practice.</summary>

          <p eId="para_998">The EPA's triennial report on the quality of water in Ireland 1998-2000, identified for the first time since the national surveys began in 1971, a reversal in the downward trend in water quality with a reported increase in the length of unpolluted river channel, from 67% in the 1995-1997 period to 70% in the 1998-2000 period. Notwithstanding this, the EPA has identified eutrophication of inland freshwaters as probably Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem. Eutrophication arises mainly from excess nutrients inputs from sources such as agriculture, sewage and industry. Agriculture has been identified as the biggest contributor of nutrients to water, accounting for 73% of all phosphorus inputs and 82% of nitrate inputs.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The primary legislative provisions for the protection and improvement of water quality are contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990. The Acts include, <i>inter alia,</i> a general prohibition on the polluting of waters, provisions concerning licensing of discharges to waters and to sewers, the establishment and application of water quality standards, and the making of water quality management plans by local authorities. Section 66 of the Waste Management Act 1996 amended the 1977 Acts to provide for additional control of substances which could pollute water, including phosphorus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, national strategy to tackle all sources of phosphorus inputs to water. This includes an integrated catchment management approach, which is widely acknowledged as the best way forward to tackle eutrophication. Alongside a long-term target of improving all unsatisfactory waters in rivers and lakes, interim quality standards were identified to be achieved generally over a ten year timeframe. Statutory effect was given to those standards and timeframe under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 and the Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus Regulations, 1998.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_77">My Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution including phosphorus. These projects will facilitate implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) which requires the maintenance of high status water quality, where it exists, and the achievement of at least good water status, generally within a 15 year timeframe. The south-east river basin management project was approved in March 2002. A project in relation to the Shannon River basin began on 6 January 2003. River basin management projects for the east and the west have also been approved in  principle. I also refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 166 and 404 on today's Order Paper.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1002">The Health Research Board, HRB, was requested to commission a study to provide an objective analysis of internationally available information regarding the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment, especially incineration activities, on public health and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The proposed study report was submitted by the HRB to an external academic peer review process, as is normal practice in such cases. I understand that this peer review process has only recently concluded and that the board hopes to be in a position to publish the study report within a relatively short period of time, probably next month.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by constituency is not available. The most recent information available is for December 2002. It should be noted that: the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit, statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey; and the areas served by local employment offices do not correspond to specific geographic boundaries or constituencies. Therefore, registrants at a given local office do not necessarily come from a particular region or area which can be precisely delineated. For instance, in the Tallaght local office in County Dublin there may be registered persons from the Blessington area in County Wicklow.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_78">The number of persons on the live register in County Kildare, by local office, for the period of  the last three years is set out in the following table:</summary>

Following on from this, an intensive series of bilateral and plenary meetings took place and, as with previous agreements, the proceedings are subject to normal confidentiality arrangements in order to protect the negotiating positions of all, including the Government side. For this reason, it would not be appropriate to release the written submissions from the Government side to the social partnership talks. However, each of the social partner pillars, including the Government side, has made clear on many occasions in the recent past its own priorities and concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Arising from these negotiations, a composite set of proposals have now been agreed, in principle, and, subject to some further changes of a textual nature to be agreed, will be made available shortly.</p>

The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommend ations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.</summary>

The role of my Department is to pay a 60% rebate to employers who have paid statutory redundancy to their employees.

          <p eId="para_1238">The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including foreign workers employed under the work permit system. Inspectors pursue alle gations of worker mistreatment for all the various categories of workers employed in Ireland, and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to foreign workers employed under the work permit system in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">In 2002 the inspectorate undertook slightly more than 8,300 inspections or visits, mainly dealing with issues arising from more than 1,000 case files, the national minimum wage, the Payment of Wages Act 1991, and employment regulation orders, and ensured the payment of €354,000 in arrears of wages to employees. Some 32 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal proceedings, 25 of these arising from the investigative work of the labour inspectorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">In addition to the investigative work undertaken by inspectors in 2002, work also commenced on the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures in the labour inspectorate. The new IT system that is expected to come on line in June this year will be the result of considerable investment by my Department, approximately €750,00 when completed. It will provide the technological support to enable inspectors operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike while also improving the interaction with the enforcement side of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">There is a policy in place in my Department whereby the processing of work permit applications for any employer is suspended when the Department becomes aware of any concerns regarding that employer's compliance with the obligations set out in the various employment rights enactments. If there is evidence that certain employers are exploiting foreign workers employed under the work permit system, it should be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</p>

          <p eId="para_1260">FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions in CE places so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE.

The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way provides for additional funding of €58,407,951 to transfer, on a phased basis, to the Department of Education and Science. The availability of this funding has enabled that Department to put in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. Consideration is also being given by my Department, the Department of Health and Children, health boards and FÁS to possible mainstreaming of certain health related services. I have no plans for further mainstreaming or transfers of CE funding at this time.</p>

An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is also being progressed by the standing committee on the labour market.

The unemployment rate is still remarkably low and a buoyant labour market remains in Ireland. However, the work permit scheme is designed to meet demand for labour in circumstances where appropriate skills are not available locally. In this context, I recently announced changes in regard to work permits. The work permits scheme is being modified in order to ensure that the number of work permits being issued reflects changing labour market realities. In future, where it is determined on the basis of experience and local labour market analysis that appropriate skills exist in sufficient quantities, the employer will be advised that an application for a work permit will not be considered by my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">Furthermore, employers must have regard to Ireland's obligations, as an EU member state, to give preference to EEA nationals and to direct their recruitment efforts accordingly.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_95">Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel is the only military aerodrome in the State. It provides facili ties for military aircraft training and operations. The latter includes fishery protection patrols, ministerial air transport, Garda air support, air ambulance missions, etc. Following a review of the Department's safety policy regarding Casement Aerodrome in 1999 and having regard to the security requirements for this military establishment, a revised policy statement based on the recommendations of the consultants who conducted the review was forwarded to South Dublin County Council for incorporation into its development plan.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">The security zone and the approach areas, which conform to international civil aviation organisation criteria, form part of the safety policy. The various restrictions on development in the vicinity of the aerodrome are, accordingly, reflected in the current plan. Section 7 (1)(e) of the Local Government Act 1991 requires a local authority, in performing its functions, to have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government and any Minister of the Government in so far as they may affect or relate to its functions. The current arrangement, which was designed to ensure the safety of military air traffic en route to and from Casement Aerodrome, has operated satisfactorily down the years and, accordingly, it has not been necessary to introduce a protected area order as provided for at section 36 of the Defence Act 1954.</summary>

The deputy chief of staff, operations, has directed that each general officer commanding a brigade now establish a brigade implementation group to put in place the recommendations contained within the RDF review implementation board report. This process will involve the establishment of convergence and reassignment boards to prepare plans for the amalgamation of units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. However, in advance of the convergence and reassignment boards' reports being approved, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on any particular possible amalgamation of FCA units.</p>

          <p eId="para_1449">In relation to the traceability of imported meat, the position is that controls on imports of meat into the EU from third countries have been set down in EU legislation.

The food and veterinary office of the EU carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments which meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU will be approved. Where the food and veterinary office is satisfied that public health requirements are not being met by premises in those countries, the establishments may be removed from the EU approved list.</summary>

Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks carried out at the border inspection post may be detained for further examination and if necessary they may be destroyed. Once products have met with all required conditions, they are released for free circulation within the European Union.</summary>

Trade in horses between member states and from member states to third countries is generally governed by European law and specific Commission decisions which establish the health conditions and health certification to be applied to such animals for trade purposes.

          <p eId="para_1469">All horses imported from the UK are required to comply with the provisions of Council Directive 90/426/EEC on health conditions governing the movement of such animals for trade purposes and in particular Articles 4 and 5, which provide that an inspection must be carried out in the 48 hours prior to their embarkation or loading. The official veterinarian of the country of dispatch must, at the time of inspection, be satisfied that the animals have not been in contact with an infectious or contagious disease during the 15 days immediately preceding inspection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470">In addition, the horses must be identified in accordance with one of the methods laid down in the directive, that is their own passports or a current signed marking sheet drawn up/signed by a veterinarian.

I have no plans to change these rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471">With regard to the welfare treatment of the animals once they are in this country, the principal statutes are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965, which are enforced by the Garda Síochána.

In the context of the Control of Horses Act 1996, the penalties for cruelty were increased to a fine of up to £1,500 and/or six months imprisonment on summary conviction; and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1473">As the Deputy may be aware, the Control of Horses Act 1996 was enacted to address the problems being caused by wandering horses in urban and rural areas. The Act provides for a comprehensive range of measures and further provides that many of the control measures envisaged by the Act would be administered and enforced by local authorities within their respective functional areas. The Act enables local authorities to, <i>inter alia,</i> designate control areas; require the licensing of horses within such areas; seize and detain stray and unlicensed horses; confiscate horses which stray repeatedly; dispose of horses seized by the local authority; and maintain a register of horses licensed and seized. The Act also contains provisions on the identification of horses and criminal liability for permitting or causing a horse to pose a danger to persons or property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">Where a horse is to be brought into a designated control area, section 20 (5)(<i>a</i>) of the Control of Horses Act 1996 provides that the relevant local authority shall not grant a horse licence to any person who is under the age of 16 years. Section 43 of the Act also states that a person who sells or offers for sale a horse to a person apparently under the age of 16 years shall be guilty of an offence. I am satisfied, therefore, that the Act provides a basis on which a local authority can deal with any current or emerging problem within its functional area in relation to the ownership and control of horses by young people.</p>

As part of the overall investment target, a capital grants scheme, co-funded by European Regional Development Fund funds, will provide assistance towards the provision of recycling, material recovery and biological treatment facilities. In addition, since the launch of the NDP there has emerged an apparently well resourced private industry which has already demonstrated its capacity to develop large scale waste facilities out of its own resources.

The individual may, however, be liable in respect of PRSI and levies in respect of the interest. The interest must be returned on the annual return of income forms. However, in the case of an individual who holds either a special savings account, or special share account or special term share account or special term account as the case may be, interest on such accounts is disregarded as part of the individual's total income as defined for tax purposes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">Consequently, such interest is not required to be disclosed in the depositor's return of income, and is not liable to PRSI-levies. If in any year of  assessment an individual or his or her spouse is 65 years or over, or is permanently incapacitated, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, from maintaining himself or herself, a refund of all DIRT deducted can be claimed, if the overall income, including deposit interest, is below the general exemption limit appropriate to the person's circumstances.</summary>

If the incapacity can be corrected or relieved by the use of any treatment, device, medication or therapy, for example coeliac disease, diabetes etc., the child is not regarded as being permanently incapacitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1542">The amount of the tax credit in the current year is €500. Where a claimant has more than one incapacitated child, a tax credit may be claimed for each child. Claims should be made to the claimant's inspector of taxes and must be accompanied by a doctor's certificate outlining (i) the date the incapacity first arose, (ii) the nature, degree and extent of the incapacity and (iii) whether the incapacity permanently prevents the child from maintaining himself or herself.</p>

          <p eId="para_1578">The provision of an additional 175 professional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists was announced on 29 May 2002. These places are being provided in response to the recommendations set out in a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, which was launched in July 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an inter-agency group which comprised representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority. The group was established to ensure the provision of the additional places and considered proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the Bacon report. The distribution of the additional places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy is as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_1635">The higher education grant scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. Under these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature  students are dependent on their parents, do not exceed prescribed limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636">Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents-guardians from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents-guardians income or address.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637">Under the means test provisions of the schemes the reckonable income of a candidate, other than an independent mature candidate, is his-her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt. At present there are no plans to change the eligibility criteria in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">My Department accepts that, in relation to a small number of applications, a student under 23 years of age may not be in a position to produce evidence of parental income. My Department has advised the local authorities and vocational education committees, which administer the grants schemes, that in such exceptional cases where compelling, independent evidence of estrangement from parents-guardians is provided, candidates who are under 23 years may be assessed without reference to their parents-guardians income or address.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">An example of the type of independent verification-evidence required would be a letter from a social worker or health board employee explaining the circumstances under which the candidate is estranged from his-her parents-guardians.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">It must be stressed that confirmation that a candidate is living separately from parents-guardians, or that the parents-guardians are refusing to provide financial support, is not sufficient in this regard.</p>

This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduces the immediate impact on schools.</p>

Funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services will increase from €102 per pupil in the calendar year  2002 to €127 per pupil in 2003. Funding will issue to all eligible schools shortly. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that these increases in the level of the ancillary services grant will be of benefit to the vast majority of primary schools. The transfer of the money to this Department from FÁS also ensures that it will now be available to the primary school sector on an ongoing basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">I am aware that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. A sum of approximately €2.5 million has been set aside to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools. My Department has engaged a firm of consultants to examine the transitional difficulties that may be experienced by schools losing the CE personnel and to consider how those adverse effects might be ameliorated. All schools will shortly receive a questionnaire from the consultants. It will be open to Scoil Chiarain to make the consultants aware of its particular difficulties.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1709">Consistent with An Agreed Programme for Government, it is proposed that every school building will attain set modern standards. This will be achieved through a multi-annual programme to be called the schools modernisation fund which will be financed by the National Development Finance Agency. The NDFA will ensure that the maximum appropriate use of public private partnerships in school projects is achieved. To assist this programme a national assessment and inventory of the condition of school buildings will be completed and regularly updated. Changes will be introduced to the method of delivering building projects in such a way as to maximise the level of devolved activity at local level. There will also continue to be a separate capital programme as part of the annual capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">The initial steps in these matters have been taken with the commencement of discussions with the Department of Finance on multi-annual funding. In addition, this year's capital programme contains a list of 20 primary schools for inclusion in a pilot initiative to allow small primary schools undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis. It is expected that this pilot scheme will be applied widely over the lifetime of the Government.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_1755">I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 299, 320, 322, 333, 340 and 341 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756">I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758">There has also been further significant progress in relation to the transfer to more appropriate accommodation of persons currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. Planning approval has been granted in respect of the new residential and day services to be built on the St. Ita's campus for residents of the St. Joseph's intellectual disability services, with building work due to commence this year. Approval has also been given to commence the planning and design work in relation to a residential and day service complex for a further 30 persons in Lusk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">There is specific mention of this programme in the health strategy with a stated objective to complete the overall transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals in all health board regions as soon as possible. The Department will be working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to achieve this objective.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_137">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been  the international experience in service provision to this population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139">This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1786">Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of key documents including: the report of the review group on the ambulance service – 1993; the cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts – 1999; and Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service, 2001, which was undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority – ERHA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">The feasibility study on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated HEMS, which was commissioned by one of the groups established under the Good Friday Agreement to examine areas of planning for major emergencies, is expected to be concluded shortly. The findings of this study will be considered by my Department, and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety – DHSSPS – in Belfast, in the context of developments in the emergency medical services generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">Any resulting initiatives in relation to the development of a HEMS will need to complement other pre-hospital services such as the ground ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to the further development of emergency medical services in the context of the recommendations of the 2001 strategic review, the 1993 report of the review group along with the continuation of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_150">Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_151">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_152">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">Since 1997, additional ongoing revenue funding of over €113 million has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services to persons with a physical or sensory disability. This additional funding has enabled significant advances to be made in terms of the quality and quantity of health services being delivered to people with physical and sensory disabilities in recent years. Services which have been significantly progressed include residential, residential respite, day care, therapy services and the provision of home support services, including personal assistance services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1900">The task force on autism, which was established by the Department of Education and Science, has put forward a range of recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services, the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues. The needs of persons in the age group identified by the Deputy are included in these recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1901">The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multifaceted response involving educational and health care inputs. The task force's recommendations are currently being considered by both Departments.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_167">There has been a significant investment in both health related and educational supports for persons with autism in recent years. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated by my Department to services for persons with autism or intellectual disability in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with autism or intellectual disability. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million,  which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_168">The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_169">In particular €14.6 million has been invested by my Department in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1909">As the Deputy may be aware there is a commitment in the national health strategy to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds, plus 600 additional day hospital beds with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as falls, osteoporosis treatment, fracture prevention, Parkinson's disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care-community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period which will include provision for people with dementia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1910">As the Deputy may also be aware, public private partnerships – PPP – are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPPs are based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units, CNUs, for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment-rehabilitation; respite; extended care; and convalescence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1911">If the PPP pilot demonstrates success it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1913">I presume the Deputy is referring to the bed management report produced by Capita Consulting. This is an independent report commissioned on foot of recommendations made by the Labour Relations Commission, as part of the settlement of the industrial dispute in accident and emergency departments last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1914">The study was carried out over a number of months, and consisted of interviews with nurses, doctors and hospital managers. A detailed survey was also conducted and a large quantity of data analysed. In general the Capita report found evidence of good bed management practices around the country. While the report is critical of certain aspects of bed management, it is important to remember that this is an independent report. Its purpose is to help establish some of the causes of weaknesses in the system, and provide guidance as to how these weaknesses, including those referred to by the Deputy, might be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1915">This is just one of a number of measures being undertaken to improve accident and emergency services. Management structures and procedures in accident and emergency departments are being strengthened; a staffing review is nearing completion; a security review was conducted and its recommendations are being implemented; and capital improvement works are being undertaken in a number of accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1916">The bed capacity initiative under the health strategy is progressing. Some 520 additional beds have been provided in 2002 and an additional 190 beds will be commissioned this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1917">Following my approval of 29 additional accident and emergency consultant posts, Comhairle na nOspidéal prepared a detailed report on accident and emergency services. The report provides valuable advice on the structures of our emergency services and the necessary linkages required to eliminate the delays in emergency departments. In terms of manpower the report recommends a total of 74 consultants in emergency medicine nationally and recognises that the implementation of this recommendation will take time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1918">The national task force on medical staffing has conducted a review of hospital medical staffing needs as part of a series of measures designed to meet the needs of the European working time directive and the provision of a consultant-provided service. It is anticipated that implementation of the directive will require significant numbers of additional consultant posts. The task force is currently preparing a first report for my consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1919">All of the measures outlined above will be brought together to form an integrated strategy for the further development of accident and emergency services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_171">I look forward to all parties and interests working together to implement the strategy in a spirit of partnership, and especially in the interests of the people who need these services.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_178">I am aware of the concerns expressed by service providers such as St. Michael's House and  families regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_179">Over the past two years an additional 90 day places, 83 residential places and 14 residential respite places have been provided by St. Michael's House, funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated nationally to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and approximately 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_180">Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_181">This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of services across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, the Department of Health and Children will work closely with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in relation to the service provision this year.</summary>

    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_558">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1964">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding thirteen dentists from various health boards – including one from the Northern Area Health Board of the ERHA – for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. An additional €0.184 million has been provided to the ERHA for the training of these dentists. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1965">In the short-term, additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated €2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists, and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, which is expected to be operational this year. The authority is also validating its orthodontic waiting lists as part of this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1966">Last year, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the ERHA received €1.815 million for the treatment of patients in this way. This scheme has also enabled some boards to make arrangements for the treatment of cases by private specialist orthodontic practitioners from Northern Ireland. Children in treatment in the health board orthodontic service receive between 18 to 24 appointments over the course of their treatment period of approximately two years. This attendance pattern is not conducive with the referral of cases overseas for treatment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_183">Finally, the regional chief executive has informed me that at the end of September 2002, there were 2,990 cases in orthodontic treatment in the authority's area and I am confident that the measures I have outlined will further improve  the provision of orthodontic services, both nationally and in the authority.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1977">The subject of cloning is one that raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct. I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_185">With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the commission on assisted human reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: "To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of  assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">The commission comprises the medical, scientific and legal expertise necessary for a detailed and informed examination of the issues involved. As part of its remit, the commission has been engaging in a wide consultation process involving relevant interested groups and the public. As part of its ongoing consultation and to assist in shaping its final report, the commission will hold a public conference on 6 February 2003 to consider the social, ethical and legal factors involved in the area of assisted human reproduction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_199">Public safety in the vicinity of State or regional airports is primarily a matter for the local authorities in which the airport is situated. In relation to the State airports, public safety issues have been determined by reference to the so-called "red zones". The present "red zones" at Dublin Airport were formally established in 1968. The Department of Transport and Power was originally responsible for proposing the establishment of the zones, which were approved and incorpor ated in the local authorities' development plans, and development within those "red zones" is controlled by the local authorities through the Planning Acts. The present dimensions of the "red zones" were established in 1968 and were designed to safeguard the then existing and planned runways both for the purposes of ICAO safety standards and for wider public safety reasons. Consequently, they are in conformity with ICAO standards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM, will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground, and will make use of the latest techniques in risk assessment. ERM's study is nearly complete. Before their report is finalised, ERM will engage in public consultation on their report, including public meetings in Dublin, Cork and Shannon. The public consultation is expected to take place before Easter this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">When the report is completed following the public consultation, it is the intention that the Department of the Environment and Local Government will issue planning guidelines based on the public safety zones to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports. The existing red zones, which deal with the need to avoid developments which could prove to be an obstacle to aircraft taking off or landing at the airports, will continue to be administered by the Irish Aviation Authority and invoked by them as necessary in making representations to the planning authorities about development which would be contrary to aviation safety.</summary>

The Deputy may wish to note that consultants, commissioned by my Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, are currently finalising a study on the development of public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. The recommendations of the consultants will deal specifically with the risks to people on the ground by providing guidance to local authorities and individuals contemplating development in the vicinity of State airports. These public safety zones will differ from the existing so-called red zones, which deal with the avoidance of obstacles to aircraft taking off or landing at the airports and which will continue to be administered by the Irish Aviation Authority.</p>

      asked the

      the Government's concerns regarding the implications here of climate change; his views on the current ratio of spending being almost six times more on new roads as against new public transport capital expenditure, in view of the fact that the transport sector is creating the greatest increases in greenhouse gases; and his further views on whether the commitment from the Government to continue this ratio of spending is in line with their climate change strategy.

          <p eId="para_2060">Greenhouse gas emissions from Irish transport at present represent some 15% of total national greenhouse gas emissions. However, this transport share of emissions is forecast to increase to some 19% by the year 2010. The transport sector, therefore, clearly presents a challenge in terms of Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol on limitation of greenhouse gas emissions. In broad terms, this challenge will have to be met, as provided for in the Government's national climate change strategy, through a combination of the following: active encouragement of more efficient road vehicles having regard to EU agreements with vehicle manufacturers; promotion of beneficial modal shifts, particularly in urban areas; and other demand management measures. Implementation of these measures, which are set out in detail in the national climate change strategy, are being pursued by my own Department and the other Departments and agencies concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_2061">The hugely increased levels of investment in public transport including infrastructure and rolling stock under the NDP will assist in reducing reliance on the private car. The 2003 Estimates provision of €400 million for capital investment in rail and bus infrastructure and rolling stock is a 138% increase on the 1999 investment level. This capital investment is complemented by a revenue subvention in 2003 of €244 million – up 84% on 1997. Total Exchequer investment in public transport in 2003 will be approximately €650 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2062">In so far as national roads are concerned, the reality is that despite the poor quality of the road network it is the primary mode of internal transport. An upgraded national road network is necessary to underpin social and economic development and more balanced regional development. It is also necessary to remove large volumes of through traffic from towns and villages around the country and to improve the level of road safety.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_212">The Government is committed, therefore, as will be clear from the high levels of investment, to upgrade both road and public transport infrastructure, as part of an integrated approach to  meeting the mobility needs of the country. Investment in transport infrastructure is being complemented by improved traffic management, better integration of transport and land planning and the promotion of the increased use of public transport.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2069">In addition, a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers, the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, has been brought together by the National Disability Authority to facilitate dialogue at national level, both within the sector and with the consultation team. I understand that the DLCG is expected in the coming weeks to present proposals for the future content of disability legislation to the consultation team.</p>
          <p eId="para_2070">The consultation team has also examined proposals from other relevant stakeholders, including disability groups, ICTU, IBEC, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Government Departments. I also understand that the consultation process is expected to conclude shortly, following which, and in accordance with the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government, it is my intention that an amended Bill will be published as soon as practicable, with provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement.</p>

          <p eId="para_2076">As I have previously explained, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order 1925. The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. The committees also submit annual reports to me which are, subject to certain restrictions on the release of information of a personal nature, released to individuals who request them directly from my Department. Since I was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 6 June 2002, no abuses have been reported to me by the prison visiting committees.</p>

          <p eId="para_2501">I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources, that the current personnel strength of Corofin Garda station, County Clare is one garda. This garda reports to the district headquarters in Ennistymon. Local Garda management is satisfied that the current personnel strength of Corofin Garda station is adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. I am further informed that the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of Corofin Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_2505">I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 381 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2506">The programme of the previous Government contained a commitment to establish a prisons inspectorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2507">Pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, an Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, was appointed on a non-statutory basis with effect from April 2002. This appointment is for a period of five years and the remuneration attaching to the post is equivalent to the maximum of the pay scale of the assistant secretary grade in the Civil Service –€106,441 as at 1 October 2002. This rate will be adjusted in line with future adjustments of that point of the scale.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_218">In relation to the procedures followed, my predecessor received Government approval for the proposed appointment of Mr. Justice Kinlen as Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention in  February 2002. Apart from his work on the High Court, Mr. Justice Kinlen has, over the years, shown a special interest in the welfare of prisoners both domestically and internationally. In his own time, he has visited prisons in Ireland and abroad. He was a member of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee at one stage. The method of appointing subsequent inspectors will be dealt with in the legislation putting the inspectorate on a statutory footing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_219">The terms of reference of the post are as follows: (a) inspect and report, as the inspector considers appropriate, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on prisons and other places of detention managed on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Irish Prison Service; (b) report in particular on conditions in those institutions and on the regimes in place for prisoners and detainees; (c) investigate and report on any specific issue referred to the inspectorate by the Minister; and, (d) submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities of the inspectorate.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">In carrying out an inspection of any prison or place of detention the inspector will, in general terms, have regard to such matters as: (a) the quality of the regime; (b) the attitude of staff and inmates; (c) health, safety and well-being of prisoners; (d) the conditions of the buildings; (e) questions of humanity and propriety; (f) any general pattern which may indicate possible inadequacies in the management of the prison.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">As the terms of reference provide, I may request the inspector to investigate and report on specific issues or incidents connected with the running of any prison or place of detention. Furthermore, the inspector may raise issues of concern, arising out of an investigation or an inspection with local management, the director general of the Irish Prison Service or myself. To facilitate the inspector in carrying out his functions, he may consider complaints from prisoners but only to the extent that such complaints are relevant to the functions of the inspector. The inspector is required, not later than four months following the end of each calendar year, to submit a written report to the Minister on his activities during the year. It is intended that the inspector's annual report will be published. The inspector will also furnish me with such information relating to his activities as I may require from time to time. The terms of reference will be reviewed during the preparation of the proposed legislation in the light of experience gained in the interim.</summary>

However, I draw the Deputy's attention to the Garda Síochána annual reports which have been lodged in the Library, the most recent of which is in respect of the year ended 31 December 2001. The reports contain comprehensive statistics on drug offences including particulars of drugs seized; the number of possession, supply, obstruction and other offences; the number of persons prosecuted by age and gender; and the number of offences where proceedings commenced in each Garda division by type of drug.</p>

          <p eId="para_2513">It would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual applications for asylum. Under the Refugee Act 1996 two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. Consideration of all claims for asylum entails a detailed investigation by the ORAC of the basis on which refugee status is being claimed and  there is also provision made for an interview and for making further representations after that interview. There is also an opportunity under the 1996 Act to appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Asylum applicants have access to legal advice for the purpose of pursuing their applications. Where the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, following detailed investigation of a claim for asylum, determine that refugee status should not be granted, the applicant concerned is provided with reasons for the determination.</p>

On 22 March 2002 he was interviewed by an officer of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. He was refused refugee status and notified of this on 16 July 2002. He appealed this decision. His appeal was heard on 11 September 2002 by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. On 29 November 2002, he was informed that the Refugee Appeals Tribunal had dismissed his appeal. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, he was informed by letter dated 22 January 2003 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in his case. He was given the options, to be exercised within fifteen working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order. A response is still awaited to this correspondence. Following the expiration of this 15 day deadline, the file in this case will be submitted to me for a decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_2528">The Local Government Act 2001 has been designed to provide a modern legislative framework for all local authorities. Under the Act all town councils, including former town commissioners, may take action to promote the community interest, exercise a representational role, with an office of mayor and structured linkage to the county council; provide local amenities and raise a local community contribution; make local by-laws and have statutory input to the local development plan process under the planning code.</p>
          <p eId="para_2529">Certain town councils, other than former town commissioners, are under the relevant statutory service codes responsible for certain mainline functions in the housing, roads and sanitary services areas. The Oireachtas in its recent comprehensive review and restatement of local government legislative powers has not seen fit to extend responsibility for such mainline functions to additional town councils, nor has this ever been done since the foundation of the State. There is no proposal to amend this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_2530">Under the national spatial strategy, the future development of towns nominated as hubs will be taken forward on the basis of integrated development frameworks to be formulated by the relevant local authorities working in partnership. The key steps in this process will include mobilisation of all relevant civic, business and community interests to establish consensus on the objectives for the hub and the surrounding catchment areas and its future development, putting in place appropriate strategies to guide development, and identification and commitment to the key actions required together with engagement of all necessary agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_2542">Compensation is  already being paid to commonage farmers who are not in the REPS scheme and who are required to reduce stock. The compensation covers actual losses per head of stock reduced and includes premia and profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_2543">My Department is still awaiting the approval by the European Commission for State aid purposes of the proposed national compensation scheme, covering commonages as well as Natura 2000 sites. Following a recent meeting at official level with the Commission, at which outstanding issues were clarified, my Department anticipates that the scheme can be approved within two to three months, following completion of the necessary procedures within the Commission. Details of the scheme will be announced once Commission approval is forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_2544">The principle underlying the scheme will be compensation of farmers for actual losses incurred or profits foregone as a result of restrictions imposed. In the case of commonages the stocking restrictions required will be the same as for farmers in the REPS scheme. As compensation relates to actual losses, it is envisaged that payments will be per head of stock reduced, covering lost premia and profits, rather than per hectare as in REPS. Having regard to the polluter pays principle, payment is only envisaged on reductions below a level of five ewe equivalents per hectare over the farm as a whole, including commonage.</p>

      the list of advertised special areas of conservation where the boundaries were changed at the request of the landowner without being considered by the Special Areas of Conservation Advisory Appeals Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2548">The European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations 1997 provide for amendment-modification of candidate Special Areas of Conservation, cSAC, both in response to objections and following surveillance of sites by authorised officers of my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2549">The Appeals Advisory Board assists in the assessment of objections from landowners by carrying out a further review of cases not initially recommended for acceptance by my Department and making an independent recommendation to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In all cases, boundary changes to provide for exclusions or inclusions must be justified on scientific grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_2550">The following table gives details of the cSAC site name, cSAC site code and location by county of the cSAC, in each case where amendments in response to objections to SACs have been made, but without reference to the Appeals Advisory Board. It should be noted that these amendments involve additions to, as well as exclusions from, cSACs and that most involve very small areas of land, often within quite large SACs.</p>

          <p eId="para_2928">I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 403 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2929">Where it is determined that a party is not in compliance with its emissions target under the Kyoto Protocol at the end of the commitment period 2008-12, the following legally binding consequences will apply: 1.3 times the amount of the excess emissions will be deducted from the party's assigned amounts for the next commitment period, that is the period commencing in 2013. In essence, a party will have to make up any shortfall in meeting its Kyoto target, plus 30%, from its total amount of allowed emissions in the second commitment period making that target more stringent; eligibility to sell credits under emissions trading arrangements will be suspended; a compliance action plan must be developed by the party, for international review and assessment, to ensure compliance within three years. Progress reports on implementation of the plan must be submitted annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_2930">The cost of purchasing assigned amount units to meet any potential non-compliance is difficult to predict in advance, but has been modelled in the range of €2-€20 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. The national climate change strategy estimated that under a business-as-usual scenario, that is, undertake no action, Ireland would be 13 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent above our Kyoto limit per annum. The cost of this overshoot could therefore be €260 million per annum or €1.3 billion for the five year Kyoto period 2008-2012, and together with the 30% penalty provision could reach €1.69 billion in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_2931">I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures to be identified in the review of the implementation of the strategy currently under way, will ensure that we are in compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

          <p eId="para_2935">I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 and 406 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2936">Rural water quality deficiencies are mainly associated with privately sourced group water schemes, some 750 of which serve 50 persons or more, approximately 50,000 households in all, and are subject to the Drinking Water Regulations 2000. In the region of 500 of these schemes require the provision of water disinfection and/or treatment equipment at source in order to consistently maintain compliance with the regulations. Connection to local authority public supplies will provide compliance in other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_2937">Some €644 million is being provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the improvement of rural water services infrastructure. Group schemes dependent on quality deficient private sources are eligible for a 100% capital grant for the provision of water disinfection and treatment equipment. In order to ensure the most cost effective delivery and operation of such equipment, and to secure the long-term protection of the related capital investment, procurement policy in the group water sector, in common with small public schemes, is based on design build operate contracts, coupled with the bundling of numbers of projects under a single contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_2938">Under the devolved rural water programme the prioritisation and approval of improvement works to individual group water schemes are the responsibility of the local authorities and are funded by way of annual blocks by my Department to county councils. On the basis of councils' most recent returns to my Department, I understand that 16 bundled DBO projects involving 131 individual group schemes, serving over 23,000 houses, are now either under construction or being progressed through the tendering process. A further ten bundled DBO projects involving 62 group schemes, serving an estimated 5,000 houses, are at an earlier stage of planning. Local authorities also currently have proposals to connect 182 quality deficient group schemes, serving around 5,500 houses, to public supply networks.</p>
          <p eId="para_2939">I will shortly be announcing the 2003 block grants under the rural water programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2944">The European Commission has recently addressed three Reasoned Opinions, final written warnings, to Ireland under Article 226 of the treaty in relation to the transposition and implementation of specific EU waste directives, as follows: (1) alleged failure to adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles – ELVs. Draft legislation is being developed to support implementation of an appropriate ELV recovery scheme in line with the requirements of the Directive. I refer to the reply to Question No. 117 of today's date; (2) alleged failure correctly to apply a number of provisions of Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste in relation to unauthorised waste operations within or close to the Boyne Estuary Special Protection Area. A response to the European Commission is being prepared on the matter; (3) alleged failure to bring into force and notify the European Commission of measures necessary to fulfil the packaging waste recovery and recycling targets required to be achieved by Ireland by 31 December 2005 under Article 6 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. In accordance with the notification procedure provided for in Article 16 of the directive, draft regulations intended to facilitate the achievement of the specified targets were notified to the Commission on 22 October 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_2946">My Department has been informed by the European Commission of its decision to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice, in order to enforce a previous judgment of the court handed down in September 1999 in case C-392/96, for non-compliance with  the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment, EIA, Directive. The Commission decided in December, 2002, to propose to the court that daily fines of €21,600 be imposed on Ireland, to apply from the day of the second judgment of the court. Since the 1999 court judgment, detailed arrangements have been put in place, including changes in planning legislation, to meet the requirements of the judgment. At this stage, the critical issue is the statutory designation of sensitive peatlands, in particular raised bogs, to complete the legal framework within which the provisions of the EIA Directive can be invoked for their protection. In December 2002 I formally proposed the designation of 101 raised bogs as special areas of conservation, SACs, under the Habitats Directive or as natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. The designation processes must be completed in accordance with legal requirements, which allow time for dealing with objections and consultation before sites are formally designated.</p>
          <p eId="para_2947">I am confident the case will be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned before it returns to court, in the light of progress on designation of sensitive peatlands in Ireland, thereby avoiding any question of the imposition of fines on Ireland by the court.</p>

          <p eId="para_3064">Ireland now has more than 100 special protection areas, SPAs, designated under the EU Birds Directive, some of which have been in place for a considerable number of years. My Department is not aware of any evidence of these designations having a dramatic impact on land values. The designation of SPAs does not in itself give rise to any entitlement to or need for compensation. Compensation is payable when financial losses arise from restrictions imposed on existing activity, to meet conservation requirements resulting from designation. The Government remains committed to payment of compensation to land owners on this basis as and when it arises. Farmers in the REP scheme receive higher rates of payment if their lands are within a designated SPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_3065">The Oireachtas undertook a comprehensive review of planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under this recently enacted legislation, planning permissions may be refused or conditioned by reference to the requirements of bird habitats under SPAs without normally giving rise to planning compensation.</p>

          <p eId="para_3080">The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their areas is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants. The initial selection of projects or works to be funded under the various grant categories is also a matter for local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3081">I recently announced 2003 non-national road allocations of €422.986 million – exclusive the local improvement scheme – to local authorities for 2003. In this context discretionary maintenance, restoration maintenance and discretionary improvement grants of €24.732 million, €50.849 million and €20.91 million have been allocated to county councils in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_3082">The significant funds available to local authorities for non-national roads maintenance and improvement are intended to cover contingencies arising from flooding, storm damage and other severe weather conditions. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads provides that the cost of remedial works necessitated by such conditions must be met from these resources and that local authorities should set aside contingency sums to finance these works.</p>
          <p eId="para_3083">My Department is also prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities to adjust their multi-annual restoration programmes in order to prioritise work necessitated by flood damage to particular roads or to carry out works to prevent future flooding, such as raising roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_3089">Expenditure in both regions is well ahead of that profiled for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002. In the BMW region actual expenditure of nearly €494 million took place against a profile of €458 million. In the SE region actual expenditure was €677 million compared to a profile of €580 million. Total expenditure in the 2000-02 period was €1.171 billion against a profile of €1.038 billion. This is almost 13% ahead of profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_3090">Excellent progress continues to be made under this measure which was confirmed by the evaluation of investment in the road network carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, and published in August 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3091">The 2003 non-national road grant allocations announced on 27 January 2003 provide for expenditure of €171.6 million in the BMW region and €247.3 million in the SE region.

          <p eId="para_3093">There has been considerable progress in waste management over the past 12 months both in terms of new initiatives and strengthened regulatory controls to drive forward the modernisation of waste services and infrastructure.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_232">A major policy statement – Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change – published in March 2002, addresses the factors and practical considerations that are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in relation to the prevention and recycling of waste. In line with this, some €14.5 million has been provided in the first round of allocations under the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme which is targeted at recycling infrastructure. This will fund 55 local authority recycling projects. Recycling infrastructure and services have expanded. Segregated domestic collection services have now been provided to around one third of all households in the State, including in Dublin, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Louth,  Meath, Kerry, Tipperary, Kildare, Longford and Monaghan. Additional bring banks and modern civic amenity sites have also been provided in many areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_233">Repak, having reported that Ireland met its EU target of recovering 25% of packaging waste in 2001, continued to report progress towards meeting the 2005 50% target. My Department's task force on the revision of the packaging regulations finalised its work and draft packaging regulations were formally notified to the European Commission in October 2002. These will introduce a ban on the landfilling of most commercial packaging waste from 1 March 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_234">Almost 45,000 composting units have been provided to householders around the country at subsidised rates in recent years. The national construction and demolition waste council was established in June 2002. This council, a voluntary initiative by the construction industry, has as its objective the securing of a significant increase in the recycling of construction and demolition waste. Other producer responsibility initiatives are being progressed, including in relation to end of life vehicles, newsprint and tyres.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">Tenders were sought in September 2002 for the provision of an all-island waste management service for waste fridges and freezers throughout the island of Ireland. The plastic bag levy was introduced in March 2002, and has had a dramatic impact on consumption of disposable plastic bags. It is a valuable initiative in raising awareness of litter and waste management initiatives generally and is widely supported by the public. A levy of €15 per tonne of waste disposed to landfill came into effect in June 2002. The proceeds, which like the plastic bag levy, are payable into a new environment fund, will drive a variety of waste management and other environmental initiatives.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">Important developments in waste legislation, in the interests of more effective management and control, include the coming into effect of the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2001 which facilitate better control of waste movements and the Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2002, which prohibit the landfilling of liquid waste and certain hazardous and infectious wastes in new landfills from July 2001, in hazardous landfills from July 2002 and in all landfills from July 2009. The regulations also prohibit the landfilling of whole tyres in new or hazardous landfill facilities from July 2003 and of shredded tyres from July 2006. These dates are extended to July 2009 in the case of existing landfill facilities. In addition, the recently published Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 contains a number of significant provisions to strengthen the enforcement powers of local authorities and the EPA in the waste management area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3101">Details of all air quality monitoring stations, including those in County Kildare operated by local authorities and the EPA, are contained in the agency's Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 2000, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. Monitoring of air  pollution is also undertaken as a condition of some integrated pollution control licences issued by the agency. Information on all aspects of IPC licences is available from the EPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_3102">The attention of Dáil Éireann has previously been drawn to aspects of air quality in County Kildare, most recently in the replies to Questions No. 177 of 13 February 2002 and No. 150 of 28 February 2002. Anomalous summer time peak levels of sulphur dioxide at the Leixlip monitoring station were highlighted in the agency's Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1999 – a copy of which is available in the Library – and addressed further in the Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 2000. This latter report stated that while recorded sulphur dioxide levels were relatively high during 2000-01 no summertime peak was observed. Additional agency direct measurements at the Leixlip site have also confirmed that there was no further recurrence of the summertime peak in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3103">While the agency's report shows that national air quality is generally good and all current EU and national air quality standards are being met, future limit values for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides will be challenging in urban areas with heavy traffic.</p>

      if the next item of private rented sector legislation promised for 2003 must not compromise successor tenants' ability to claim rights under the Landlord and Tenants (Amendment) Act 1980.

          <p eId="para_3196">It is the intention that the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill will abolish, with effect from five years after enactment of the relevant provision, the right to claim a lease on the basis of long occupation equity under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 where such a lease is  being claimed for the first time. During the transitional five-year period an option to renounce the entitlement, similar to that introduced for offices in 1994 and recommended in the 1996 report of the working group on security of tenure, will be available. Any tenant who has never previously had a long occupation equity lease and who does not exercise an entitlement under the 1980 Act to such a lease before or during those five years would lose that right. Tenants in the formerly rent controlled sector, for whom the protection of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Acts expired in July 2002, would have already satisfied the 20 year occupation requirement for eligibility to claim the lease and so the five year transitional period gives them ample opportunity to do so before the entitlement is abolished.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_246">My Department has recently reviewed the site boundary for the candidate special area of conservation, cSAC, No. 000091 known as Clonakilty Bay, and concluded that a minor amendment to the boundary, to exclude a strip five metres  wide along the line of the existing road, would have no significant impact on the conservation status of the cSAC. At no point in this assessment process were commercial considerations taken into account. The landowner requested a boundary change on safety grounds, to facilitate improvements to the road, which were also provided for in the Cork County development plan. However, the possibility of adjusting the boundary was considered by Dúchas on scientific grounds, and following surveillance, having regard to the nature of the habitats immediately adjoining the existing road. These were mainly grassland, included originally in the site only because the road was selected as the boundary. Roads are regularly used as boundaries for sites designated for nature conservation purposes as they provide clearly identifiable boundaries on the ground and on maps.</summary>

      the measures he intends to take to prevent a group of landowners from controlling the supply and price of building land for housing within the greater Dublin area.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_3379">The Government is firmly committed to the continuation of the measures which we initiated in its previous term to increase the supply of housing. Our measures have led to record levels of house completions and there are strong indications that completions in 2002 will be in the region of 57,200 units – exceeding the record level of 52,602 units achieved in 2001. Over 287,000 units have been built since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_3380">This strong performance is particularly reflected in Dublin. I expect that house completions in Dublin will considerably exceed 10,000 units in 2002, thereby demonstrating that the funding and institutional mechanisms put in place by this Government are now having an impact on increasing housing output in Dublin.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_247">There are also good indications for the future supply of houses in the Dublin and the greater Dublin area, GDA, as HomeBond registrations in 2002 increased by 85% in Dublin and 63% in the GDA. In addition, the amount of available serviced residential land has kept apace with the record level of house completions being achieved. The latest survey – June 2002 – shows that there is a more than adequate stock of serviced building land available throughout the country  for residential development – there are currently over 12,200 hectares of serviced residentially zoned land nationally, with an estimated yield of 328,000 housing units. Dublin has about 2,300 hectares of serviced residentially zoned land with an estimated yield of about 96,700 units and the GDA has 3,500 hectares with an estimated yield of about 123,400 units.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">With this information and the outstanding track record in house completions it is very difficult to credibly conclude that the supply of building land is being controlled. The overall objective of this Government is to continue to at least maintain these record levels of output in order to satisfy the projected housing demand. However, in this context, we will review as necessary the position, having regard to the need to maintain the excellent progress already made.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3385">The students' summer job scheme was  first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. Due to the growth of the availability of well-paid summer jobs, the level of student interest in the scheme overall has been declining in recent years, that is, from 20,930 applications in 1998 to 7,702 in 2002. In view of this and in light of the tighter economic situation, it has been decided to discontinue the students summer jobs scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_3411">The adoptive benefit scheme provides a weekly payment to adopting parents who are either employed or self-employed and is designed to support them during a period of adoptive leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_3412">Qualification for adoptive benefit requires that the claimant has first established an entitlement to adoptive leave and the duration of adoptive benefit is contingent on the duration of the appropriate leave. Responsibility for adoptive leave falls under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_3413">The weekly rate of payment is 70% of the recipient's gross weekly earnings in the relevant tax income year, subject to a minimum rate per week of €141.60 and a maximum weekly rate of €232.40. In 2002, a total of 215 clients received adoptive benefit at a cost of €578,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_3414">A number of improvements have been made to the adoptive benefit scheme since its introduction in 1995. In 1997 the scheme was extended to self employed contributors. The duration of adoptive leave was extended by four weeks from February 2001 and adopting parents are now entitled to 14 weeks adoptive leave.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_250">I understand that the Adoptive Leave Act is currently under review by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As the adoptive benefit scheme is directly related to adoptive  leave, the results of that review will be examined by my own Department to determine if any consequential changes to the adoptive benefit scheme are required.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3416">While the full legislative programme for my Department for the current Dáil has not been finalised, I intend to bring forward a number of legislative initiatives over the coming months. Two Bills have been prioritised for progression in the current Dáil session, namely the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 and the Civil Registration Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_3417">The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, will be published very shortly. It will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the implementation of certain social welfare improvements announced in the Budget Statement of 4 December 2002 such as increases in the monthly rates of child benefit, increases in the respite care grant and extending the payment of child dependant allowances for certain recipients of short-term social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_3418">The Bill will also provide for a number of other changes to the social welfare code, and a number of technical amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 consequent on the enactment of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_3419">The civil registration Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will provide a new legal framework for the registration of births, marriages and deaths. It will update the existing legislation, some of which dates back to the mid-19th century. The passing of this legislation is one element of the civil registration modernisation programme. This modernisation is a joint project between my Department and that of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children which is now nearing implementation.</p>

          <p eId="para_3425">The Family Mediation Service has been considerably expanded in recent years. The service is now available from centres in Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Tralee and Wexford. There are four centres in the Dublin region in Earlsfort Terrace – Head Office, Tallaght, Marino and Blanchardstown. Last year the Family Mediation Service assisted over 1,300 couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_3426">The future development of the Family Mediation Service is one of the core functions of the new Family Support Agency.

          <p eId="para_3427">The Government has allocated €17.2 million for the work of the agency in 2003. This includes specific provision for the establishment of family mediation services in the south east and the north west of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_3430">The range of employment support services administered by this Department was reviewed last year in the light of the major economic and labour market changes that have occurred in recent years. This transformation in labour market conditions is illustrated by the drop in unemployment levels since the introduc tion of the back to work allowance in 1993. When the allowance was introduced the overall unemployment level was 15.7% and long-term-unemployment stood at 8.9%. By 2001 overall unemployment had fallen to 3.7% and long-term-unemployment was down to 1.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_3431">The review also took cognisance of an independent evaluation of the scheme which was published in December 2000. The report recommended, in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_3432">Following on from this review the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit-assistance has been increased to five years with effect from 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_3433">It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the more vulnerable in our community. I have no immediate plans to change the existing qualifying criteria for participation on the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_3437">To benefit under the dental benefit scheme, an insured worker must be treated by a dentist who has entered into an agreement with my Department to provide treatments under the scheme on a contract basis and at fees specified in the agreement. Under these arrangements and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patient either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates.

        <summary eId="sum_251">While some dentists have not been prepared to treat patients within these contracts, the scheme has continued to operate and dental treatment has been provided by dentists who have adhered  to their contracts. Insured workers have been advised, during this dispute, to check that their dentist was continuing to operate within his contract with the Department and in the event that their dentist was not doing so, they were advised to use my Departments LoCall service 1890-400-400 to get details of dentists adhering to the agreed fees for treatments. Patients were also advised that the Department would not be in a position to refund any costs arising from treatment provided to them as private patients.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Hogan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if the same relief from PRSI and the health levies will apply to contributions made personally to PRSAs and personal pensions as those made through employer payroll PRSA schemes under the net pay agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3473">The same relief from PRSI and the health levies will apply to contributions made personally to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, and personal pensions as will apply in respect of PRSAs which are relieved directly under the net pay arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_3474">This was provided for in section 11 of the Social Welfare Act 2002, which gave me power to make regulations for this purpose in relation to PRSI. Section 16 of the Social Welfare Act 2002 amended the Health Contributions Act 1979 to give power to the Minister for Health and Children to make a similar regulation in relation to the health levy. It is intended to make these regulations in 2003 and these will apply in respect of any payments made outside the payroll system to PRSAs or personal pensions in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_3475">The tax treatment of personal pensions in relation to net pay arrangements is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>
